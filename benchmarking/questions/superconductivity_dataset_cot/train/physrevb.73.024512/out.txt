###### Abstract

The superconductor YB6 has the second highest critical temperature T_{c} among the boride family MB_{0}. We report measurements of the specific heat, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and thermal expansion from 2 to 300 K, using a single crystal with T_{c}=7.2 K. The superconducting gap is characteristic of medium-strong coupling. The specific heat, resistivity, and expansivity curves are deconvolved to yield approximations of the phonon density of states F(\omega), the spectral electron-phonon scattering function \sigma_{\omega}^{2}F(\omega), and the phonon density of states weighted by the frequency-dependent Gruneisen parameter \gamma_{G}(\omega)F(\omega), respectively. Lattice vibrations extend to high frequencies >100 meV, but a dominant Einstein-like mode at \sim8 meV, associated with the vibrations of yttrium ions in oversized boron cages, appears to provide most of the superconducting coupling and gives rise to an unusual temperature behavior of several observable quantities. A surface critical field H_{c3} is also observed.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity at \sim40 K in the metallic compound MgB_{2} (Refs. 1 and 2) has stimulated a renewed interest in borides. The next highest superconducting critical temperatures in the MB_{0} family are found in YB6 with T_{c}\,\leq\,8.4 K and ZrB12 with T_{c}=6.0 K.[3] These compounds are hard materials with a low density of states at the Fermi level. Their crystal structure--CaB_{6} type (bcc, Pm\bar{3}m-O_{b}^{1}) for YB6 and UB_{12} type (fcc, Fm\bar{3}m-O_{b}^{5}) for ZrB12--is three dimensional and characterized by boron cages in which yttrium or zirconium atoms can develop large vibrational amplitudes. The metal-boron distance (2.76 A in ZrB12 and 3.01 A in YB6) is remarkably large, giving rise to unusual properties. ZrB12 was recently investigated with respect to its specific heat, resistivity, thermal expansion, and magnetic properties.[4, 5] Characteristic features of ZrB12 were type-II/1 superconductivity,[6] an enhanced gap and critical field at the surface, and weak electron-phonon coupling essentially driven by a single anharmonic mode at 14 meV. In this work we turn to YB6, the specific heat of which was only briefly mentioned in an early paper,[7] and find that some of these peculiarities are also present and even more dramatic. Here, a corresponding anharmonic lattice mode has softened to 8 meV, giving rise to a very unusual temperature dependence of the specific heat, resistivity, and expansivity. This effect is so marked that YB6 can be considered as a textbook example of superconductivity in an Einstein lattice, a limiting situation where strong-coupling theory is well assessed.[8] Another consequence of having low-energy modes is that "thermal" spectroscopies--i.e., experiments sensitive to a density of energy states convolved with a thermal distribution--become efficient. In this work we show that specific heat and resistivity can indeed provide information usually taken from inelastic neutron scattering and tunneling spectroscopy, with a limited but sufficient accuracy to characterize the superconducting coupling at a quantitative level.

This article is organized as follows. In Sec. II experimental details and basic sample characterizations are given. The electronic specific heat is analyzed in Sec. III. Sections IV-VI are devoted to the deconvolution of the specific heat, resistivity, and thermal expansivity curves to obtain information on the phonon density of states F(\omega), electron-phonon transport coupling function \alpha_{\nu}^{2}F(\omega), and frequency-dependent Gruneisen parameter \gamma_{G}(\omega), respectively. The magnetic phase diagram with four critical field lines is established in Sec. VII, based on different experiments. The compositional dependence is briefly addressed in Sec. VIII, before concluding in Sec. IX. A wealth of experimental information is already available for YB6 in the literature, and we refer to Ref. 9 for a review.

## II Crystal growth and experimental details

The preparation of single crystals of yttrium hexaboride involved several steps: synthesis of YB6 powder by borothermal reduction of Y_{2}O_{3}, compacting the powder into rods, sintering, and zone melting by inductive heating. Since the superconducting critical temperature of YB6 is particularly sensitive to impurities, 99.999%-pure Y_{2}O_{3} powder and >99.5% amorphous boron were used as starting materials. The highly volatile impurities contained in the latter were eliminated during the synthesis and zone melting procedures, resulting in a total impurity concentration in the crystals under study of at most 0.001% in weight.

Taking into account the genetic melting of YB6 (Ref. 10) and previous results on crystal growth,[11] we synthesized  the initial powders with excess boron in order to lower the melting temperature. High-quality single crystals were obtained for a source composition B/Y > 6.8. Other important technological parameters were the pressure of argon gas, 1.3 MPa, and the growth rate, 13 mm/h. The growth was unstable over the first few mm, yielding a two-phase mixture of YB4 and YB6. The process subsequently stabilized and at a definite B/Y ratio a single-phase ingot started to grow. Due to concurrent growth, one grain grew at the expense of the others and approximately \langle 100\rangle-oriented single crystals were obtained with a length of about 30 mm.

The as-grown single crystal used for nearly all subsequent experiments was shaped into a parallelepiped bar by spark cutting and then polished using abrasive diamond paste. Its dimensions are \sim12 \times 3 \times 1.5 mm^{3} and mass 73.5 mg, with the long axis parallel to the \langle 100\rangle direction and the facets perpendicular to \langle 010\rangle and \langle 001\rangle. Measurements in a magnetic field were taken with the field along the length of the sample in order to minimize the demagnetization factor (D\cong 0.03). The superconducting transition temperature T_{c} was determined by four methods: resistivity [Fig. 1(a)], ac susceptibility [Fig. 1(b)], dc magnetization [Fig. 1(c)], and specific-heat jump at T_{c} (see Fig. 3 below) which, in this order, are increasingly representative of the bulk volume. On average, T_{c}\cong 7.2 K, the transition width being \sim2% of T_{c} (Table 1).

The dc resistivity \rho was measured by a four-lead technique with current reversal, using a 5 mA current. The contacts were made with Degussa "Leitsilber 200" conducting silver paint. The residual resistivity ratio was \rho(300 K)/\rho(2 K) = 3.87. The residual resistivity \rho(2 K) = 9.9 \mu\Omega cm was determined in a magnetic field of 5 T to quench superconductivity; the resistivity did not vary appreciably below 9 K. No significant magnetoresistance was observed in the normal state.

The magnetization M was measured in a Quantum Design MPMS-5 magnetometer, using a scan length of 4 cm. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) susceptibility in the Meissner state was measured in a field of 2.7 Oe, which is \sim1% of the lower critical field at T= 0 [Fig. 1(c)]. The normal-state susceptibility \chi(T) was obtained from the initial slope of M(H) measured at 1-T intervals from 0 to 5 T. The core and Pauli contributions nearly cancel each other, resulting in a small and slightly diamagnetic susceptibility. A Curie component develops at low temperature, possibly due to traces of magnetic rare earth metals in the Y starting material (Fig. 2). The best fit is obtained by allowing a second-order term in the Pauli susceptibility:

\[\chi(T)=\chi(0)+aT^{2}+\frac{C_{Curie}}{T}.\] (1)

The fitted parameters are (S.I.) \chi(0)= -9.6 \times 10^{-6}, a= 2.4 \times 10^{-11} K^{-2}, and C_{Curie}= 1.8 \times 10^{-4} K. The Curie term is equivalent to 35 ppm at. Yb^{3+}.

The specific heat was measured by a generalized relaxation technique at low temperature (1.2-15 K) (Ref. 12) and in an adiabatic, continuous-heating calorimeter at high temperature (16-300 K).^{12} Care was taken to measure the re

  sidual field of the 14 T magnet mounted in the cryostat, compensating this when required. Specific heat runs were taken after cooling in a field from above T_{c} in order to achieve the best possible field penetration.

A high-resolution capacitance dilatometer [13, 14] was used to measure the thermal expansion in the temperature range 3-250 K. Data were taken both upon heating and cooling at a constant rate of 5 mK/s at low temperatures (3-15 K) and at 20 mK/s up to 250 K. Flowing He exchange gas (0-4 mbar) was used to thermally couple the sample to the dilatometer.

## III Electron-specific heat, density of states, and coupling strength

The specific heat at low temperature in both the superconducting (H=0) and normal state (H=1 T) is shown in Fig. 3. The superconducting-state specific heat C_{s} shows a sharp second-order jump at T_{c}. It vanishes at T\rightarrow 0 in a somewhat unusual way, since C_{s}/T tends to a finite value \gamma_{0} = 0.03 mJ K^{-2} gat^{-1} rather than zero as would be expected in a fully gapped state (one gram-atom [gat] is one Avogadro's number of atoms, here one-seventh of a mole (Table 2). This residual contribution, which may be due to an extrinsic non-superconducting fraction or to a gapless electron band, will not be discussed further as it only represents \sim5% of the normal-state electronic specific heat. The normal-state specific heat is analyzed in a standard way according to the expansion

\[C_{n}(T\to 0)=\gamma_{n}T+\sum_{n=1}^{3}\beta_{2n+1}T^{2n+1},\] (2)

where the first term is the electronic contribution, with \gamma_{n} =\frac{1}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda_{ep})N(E_{F}), k_{B} Boltzmann's constant, \lambda_{ep} the electron-phonon coupling constant and N(E_{F}) the band-structure density of states at the Fermi level including two spin directions [electronic density of states (EDOS)]. The second term is the low-temperature expansion of the lattice specific heat, where \beta_{3}=\frac{12}{5}N_{Au}k_{B}\pi^{4}\theta_{D}^{3}(0), with N_{Au} Avogadro's number and \theta_{D}(0) the initial Debye temperature. From a fit of the normal-state data from 1.2 to 7.5 K, we obtain \gamma_{n}=0.58 mJ K^{-2} gat^{-1} and \theta_{D}(0)=706 K (369 K if according to another convention only acoustic modes are considered). The Sommerfeld constant \gamma_{n}, which is \sim50% larger than that mentioned by Matthias _et al._, [7] corresponds to a renormalized EDOS (1+\lambda_{ep})N(E_{F})=1.73 eV^{-1} cell^{-1}. The band structure has been calculated by several groups. [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] Comparing the renormalized EDOS with the recently obtained values N(E_{F})= 0.82 (Ref. [19]), 0.83 (Ref. [20]), and 0.93 (Ref. [21]) eV^{-1} cell^{-1}, we find room for an electron-phonon renormalization factor \approx2--i.e., \lambda_{ep}=1.12, 1.08, and 0.86, respectively. The value \lambda_{ep}^{\infty}1 is supported by independent determinations. For example, we may start from \Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c}, the normalized specific heat jump at T_{c}, as a well-defined input observable. From there we evaluate T_{c}/\omega_{\rm in}=0.071 using isotropic single-band strong-coupling formulas representing interpolated solutions of Eliashberg equations (Eq. 5.9 of Ref. [8]; \omega_{\rm in} is the logarithmic moment exp[\int\ln\omega a^{2}F(\omega)d\omega/\omega/\int\alpha^{2}F(\omega)d\omega/\omega] of the Eliashberg

  function \alpha^{2}F(\omega)). Assuming the conventional value \mu^{*} =0.10 for the Coulomb pseudopotential,[22] we obtain \lambda_{ep} = 1.01 according to the Allen-Dynes equation.[22] A change of \pm0.05 in \mu^{*} affects the value of \lambda_{ep} by \pm0.15. In Sec. V we give a third independent determination \lambda_{ep}=1.04 which relies on the electrical and optical conductivity and confirms the first two calculations. At this point we already wish to draw attention to the low value \omega_{\rm ln}=101 K \ll\theta_{D}(0)=706 K that results from this analysis. YB_{6} is characterized by selective electron-phonon coupling to low-frequency modes.

The thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) is obtained by numerical integration of the specific heat data (Table 3):

\[-\frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}VH_{c}^{2}(T)=\Delta U(T)-T\Delta S(T),\]

\[\Delta U(T)=\int_{T}^{T_{c}}\left[C_{s}(T^{\prime})-C_{n}(T^{\prime})\right]dT ^{\prime},\]

\[\Delta S(T)=\int_{T}^{T_{c}}\frac{C_{s}(T^{\prime})-C_{n}(T^{\prime})}{T^{ \prime}}dT^{\prime},\] (3)

where the volume V and other specific quantities refer to 1 g at. H_{c}(T) is nearly parabolic and extrapolates to 55 mT at T=0 (see Fig. 16, below). The deviation function D(t)\equivh-(1-t^{2}), where h=H_{c}(T)/H_{c}(0) and t=T/T_{c}, is a good indicator of the coupling strength.[8] The curve for YB_{6} (Fig. 4, inset) is very similar to that of Nb_{77}Zr_{23}, for which 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\equiv 4.2,[23] and is bounded by those of Nb and Hg, for which 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\equiv 4.0 and 4.6, respectively.[8] Other estimations of the gap ratio rely on the slope of the BCS semi-logarithmic plot (Fig. 4),[24] the normalized specific heat jump at T_{c} [Eq. (4.1) of Ref. [8]], or a fit of the \alpha model.[25] These determinations consistently yield 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=4.1\pm0.1 and only differ by the weighting given to different temperature ranges. Finally we recall tunneling measurements giving 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=4.02 and \lambda_{ep}=0.90 (with \mu^{*}=0).[26] All these determinations provide evidence for medium- to strong-coupling superconductivity in YB_{6}. In this respect, YB_{6} differs from ZrB_{12} which is a weakly coupled superconductor (Table 2).[4, 5]

Finally, note that the shape of the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state excludes d-wave superconductivity. In particular, in the latter case the dimensionless ratio \gamma_{n}T_{c}^{2}/\mu_{0}VH_{c}^{2}(0) would be nearly twice as large (3.7) as that observed (2.00\pm0.05).[27]

## IV IV. Lattice specific heat and phonon density of states

The low-temperature T^{3} regime of the lattice specific heat does not extend beyond a few kelvin, as shown by the large positive curvature of the normal-state curve in Fig. 3. Huge deviations with respect to the ideal Debye model persist at higher temperature (Fig. 5). The shape of the lattice specific heat in the C/T plot is very uncommon, exhibiting a large low-temperature peak (Fig. 6). The specific heat at room temperature reaches only \sim56% of the Dulong-Petit value, showing that the thermal energy at 300 K is still too low to excite all the spectral modes. The effective Debye temperature \theta_{eff}(T) is defined as the value of \theta necessary to fit the experimental specific heat at any T with the equation

\[C_{ph}(T)=9N_{Av}k_{B}\left(\frac{T}{\theta}\right)^{3}\int_{0}^{\theta T} \frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}dx.\] (4)

We have assumed C_{ph}=C_{total}-\gamma_{n}T, neglecting the anharmonic specific heat. This is justified by the estimation C_{p}-C_{v}=(3\alpha)^{2}BVT, where B\equiv 190 GPa is the bulk modulus and \alpha\equiv 6.1\times10^{-6} K^{-1}, the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (see Sec. VI); (C_{p}-C_{v})/C_{p}\simeq 0.8% at 250 K. The electronic term \gamma_{n}T only represents \sim1% of C_{total} at room temperature. Starting from its initial value \theta_{eff}(0)=\theta_{D}(0) =706 K, the effective Debye temperature passes through a

  deep minimum \theta_{epf}(16 K) = 278 K, then increases monotonically, suggesting an asymptotic value between 1100 and 1200 K. Its room-temperature value is \theta_{eff}(300 K) = 1088 K. Figure 5 shows the ideal Debye specific heat for selected values of the Debye temperature. It is clear that the data do not match any curve with a constant \theta_{D}. These plots point towards a large phonon density of states (PDOS) at energies of the order of 80-100 K. Analogous situations occur--albeit to a lesser extent--in Na and Al due to the presence of optical phonons [28] and in the borides ZrB_{12} (Ref. [4]) and LaB_{6} (Ref. [29]), for example. The specific-heat data at high temperature are sufficiently minimally scattered to attempt a deconvolution of C_{ph}(T) to extract the PDOS F(\omega). More precisely, we can only obtain a substitutional spectrum--i.e. a smoothed phonon density of states \widetilde{F}(\omega) which precisely reproduces the specific heat and low-order moments of F(\omega) but may not show the true PDOS in detail. A simplified method consists of representing F(\omega) by a basis of Einstein modes with constant spacing on a logarithmic frequency axis:

\[F(\omega)=\sum_{k}F_{k}\delta(\omega-\omega_{k}).\] (5)

The corresponding lattice specific heat is given by

\[C_{ph}(T)=3N_{A\omega}k_{B}\sum_{k}F_{k}\frac{x_{k}^{2}e^{x_{k}}}{(e^{x_{k}}- 1)^{2}},\] (6)

where x_{k}= \omega_{k}/T. The weights F_{k} are found by a least-squares fit of the lattice specific heat. The number of modes is chosen to be small enough to ensure the stability of the solution; a practical choice is \omega_{k+1}/\omega_{k}= 1.75. Note that we do not try to find the energy of each mode; we aim rather at establishing a histogram of the density in predefined frequency bins. The robustness of the fit (rms deviation <0.2% above 16 K) is demonstrated by the reproducibility of the results of two independent runs over slightly different temperature ranges (Table 4). The sum of weights exceeds the ideal value 1 by 10%; most probably part of the fitted weight in the highest-energy modes in this harmonic model only serves to simulate the anharmonic contribution. Table 4 also gives the generalized moments

\[\widetilde{\omega}_{\rm ln}=\exp\left(\frac{\int\omega^{-1}\ln\omega F(\omega) d\omega}{\int\omega^{-1}F(\omega)d\omega}\right),\] (7)

\[\langle\widetilde{\omega}^{2}\rangle^{1/2}\equiv\left(\frac{\int\omega F( \omega)d\omega}{\int\omega^{-1}F(\omega)d\omega}\right)^{1/2},\] (8)

to be compared later with similar moments of the Eliashberg function \alpha^{2}F(\omega). Figure 6 illustrates the decomposition of the lattice-specific heat into Einstein contributions. The PDOS obtained in this way is shown in Fig. 9 below. It consists of a background with a high cutoff frequency, as expected in view of the light and rigid boron sublattice, superposed onto a strong peak at \sim8 meV which is associated with nearly free oscillations of the Y atoms in oversized boron cages. The relative weight of the latter peak, \sim10% (\sim15% if we include both neighboring energy bins), is of the order of the fraction of Y atoms per formula unit. The question therefore arises as to what extent this low-energy region of the PDOS contributes to the electron-phonon coupling. Different answers have been given in the literature, with the main coupling being attributed to either the boron sublattice [16] or translational modes involving the yttrium ions [26]. This point is addressed in the next section, using resistivity as an experimental probe.

Figure 5: Lattice-specific heat of YB_{6} vs the temperature up to room temperature. The long-dashed line shows the Debye-specific heat calculated using a constant Debye temperature equal to its minimum \theta_{D}(16 K) = 278 K, the short-dashed line using the effective value at room temperature \theta_{D}(300 K) = 1088 K. Inset: effective Debye temperature vs temperature.

  A comparison with standard determinations of the PDOS is instructive. YB_{6} has been studied by inelastic incoherent neutron scattering on polycrystals.[30] According to this unpublished work, the GDOS, i.e., the generalized PDOS weighted by the scattering cross sections of the Y and B atoms, extends to about 200 meV and exhibits a low-frequency peak at \sim10 meV.[16] However, the integrated GDOS up to 15 meV only contains 1.3% of the total weight, one order of magnitude below the result from the specific heat. The GDOS and the true PDOS are expected to differ in the present case owing to the different scattering cross sections of yttrium and boron. A determination of the PDOS by inelastic neutron scattering on single crystals is not available for YB_{6}, but dispersion curves up to \sim60 meV are known for the isostructural compounds LaB_{6} and SmB_{6}.[31, 32] In both cases, it was found that the optical modes are separated from the acoustic ones by a wide gap, which can be observed around 24 meV in the PDOS of YB_{6} derived from the specific heat (Fig. 9 below). It was also pointed out that the acoustic modes of LaB_{6} (SmB_{6}), both longitudinal and transverse, are unusually flat over the major part of the Brillouin zone, due to the noninteracting vibration of the La (Sm) ion. This gives rise to a low-frequency peak at \sim2.5-3 THz (\sim10-12 meV) in the PDOS. Although yttrium is lighter, this peak lies at \sim8 meV in YB_{6} according to the specific heat. This softening is associated with the weaker bond due to the smaller radius of the metal ion, while the size of the boron cage undergoes little change.

High frequency modes have been studied by Raman techniques in the hexaboride series (see Ref. [33] and references therein). They are associated with "internal" modes of the boron octahedra. Their energies cannot be resolved by the deconvolution of the specific heat, but their weight is included in the highest two frequency bins.

## V Resistivity and Electron-Phonon Coupling

The resistivity (Fig. 7) is analyzed in a similar way. We start from the generalized Bloch-Gruneisen formula (see, e.g., Ref. [34], in particular pp. 212 and 219)

\[\rho_{BG}(T)=\rho(0)+\frac{4\,\pi m^{*}}{ne^{2}}\int_{0}^{\omega_{\rm max}} \alpha_{\rho}^{2}F(\omega)\frac{xe^{x}}{\left(e^{x}-1\right)^{2}}d\omega,\] (9)

where x\equiv\omega/T and \alpha_{\rho}^{2}F(\omega) is the electron-phonon "transport coupling function." In the restricted Bloch-Gruneisen approach, one would have \alpha_{\rho}^{2}F(\omega)\propto\omega^{4}, and as a consequence

\begin{table}

Using a decomposition into a basis of Einstein modes similar to Eq. (5),

\[\alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k}\lambda_{tr,k}\omega_{k}\delta( \omega-\omega_{k}),\] (10)

we obtain the discrete version of Eq. (9):

\[\rho_{BG}(T)=\rho(0)+\frac{2\pi}{\varepsilon_{0}\Omega_{p}^{2}}\sum_{k}\lambda _{tr,k}\omega_{k}\frac{x_{k}e^{x_{k}}}{(e^{x_{k}}-1)^{2}},\] (11)

where the fitting parameters are the dimensionless constants l_tr,k_. The constraint l_tr,k_ >= 0 is enforced. The residual resistivity \rho(0)=9.9~\mu\Omega~cm is determined separately (inset of Fig. 7). The unscreened plasma frequency O_p_ = (_ne_2/_e_0m1)1/2 = 5.2 eV is taken from extensive optical spectroscopy experiments performed on the same single crystal, to be published elsewhere.[21] The negative curvature of the resistivity at high temperature, a rather general phenomenon possibly related to the Mott limit,[35, 36] is taken into account by the empirical "parallel-resistor" formula[37]

\[\frac{1}{\rho(T)}=\frac{1}{\rho_{BG}(T)+\rho(0)}+\frac{1}{\rho_{\max}}.\] (12)

The parameter _r_max = 73 _m_O cm is fitted simultaneously to the parameters l_tr,k_, using data taken in either H = 0 (_T_c  T  8 300 K) or 5 T (2.2  T  8 300 K). These two data sets are fitted independently (rms error ~0.2%) in order to evaluate the robustness of the results (Table 4). Only a few basis modes contribute. Two low-energy modes at ~8 and ~4.5 meV clearly stand out (Fig. 9 below), in agreement with tunneling data featuring a peak in the Eliashberg function \alpha^{2}F(\omega) at 8.5 meV and a shoulder at ~5 meV.[26] The electron-phonon coupling parameter relevant for transport _kr_ = 2 _to_-1 \alpha_{tr}^{-1}\rho_{tr}^{2}F(\omega) is obtained from l_tr_ = _k_l_tr,k_ = 1.04. Within experimental accuracy, it is equal to the electron-phonon coupling parameter relevant for superconductivity obtained in the previous section, _kp_ = 2 _to_-1 \alpha^{2}F(\omega) = 1.01. This is expected for phonon-mediated superconductors,[22, 34] but demonstrated experimentally in the present case. Finally, the value of _o_ln given by

\[\omega_{\ln}=\exp\left(\frac{\int\omega^{-1}\ln\omega a_{tr}^{2}F(\omega)d \omega}{\int\omega^{-1}\alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega)d\omega}\right)=\exp\left( \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\ln\omega_{k}\right)\] (13)

and the alternative determination of _o_ln obtained from the dimensionless specific heat jump in Sec. III both give the same value, 8.7 meV. Numerical results are summarized in Table 4, including the generalized second moment

\[\langle\omega^{2}\rangle^{1/2}=\left(\frac{\int\omega\alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega) d\omega}{\int\omega^{-1}\alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega)d\omega}\right)^{1/2}=\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\omega_{k}^{2}\right)^{1/2}.\] (14)

When compared with thermodynamic data, the analysis of the dc and optical conductivity therefore leads to the conclusion that superconductivity is essentially driven by a single low-energy mode (or a narrow group of modes), since _o_ln is very close to the low-frequency peak of the PDOS. This conclusion, which is at odds with early electronic-structure and phonon-mode calculations,[16] fully supports tunneling spectroscopy experiments.[26] YB_{6} is an almost local case of a superconductor with an Einstein PDOS. Just as in ZrB_{12},[4] most of the electron-phonon coupling arises from the large-amplitude, low-frequency vibrations of the loosely bound metal atoms in the oversized boron cages.

More generally, it is interesting to note that the resistivity equation (11) can be reexpressed in a form that emphasizes the similarity with the specific heat [Eq. (6)]:

\[\frac{\rho_{BG}(T)-\rho(0)}{T}=\frac{R_{0}k_{B}}{\varepsilon_{0}V_{p}^{2}} \sum_{k}\lambda_{tr,k}E(T/T_{k}),\] (15)

where R_{0}\equiv h/e^{2}=25.8~kO is the quantum of resistance, V_{p} the plasma frequency in volts, and E(x)=x^{2}e^{x}/(e^{x}-1)^{2} the normalized Einstein specific heat at a temperature T due to a mode with a characteristic temperature _T__{k}. In the case of coupling to a single mode, this reduces to

\[\frac{\rho_{BG}(T)-\rho(0)}{C_{ph}T}=\frac{R_{0}k_{B}}{\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{ \lambda_{tr}}{\upsilon_{p}^{2}}=\text{const}.\] (16)

This scaling of C_{ph} and [\rho_{BG}(T)-\rho(0)]/T is approximately obeyed in ZrB_{12} and YB_{6} due to the predominance of one soft mode. Grimvall[34] noted that a similar relation holds in the high-temperature limit for any number of modes. As no large variation is expected in the plasma frequency O_p_ \cong(e^{2}/\varepsilon_{0}m_{v}V_{cell})^{1/2} of trivalent hexaborides which have one free carrier per unit cell,[9] Eq. (16) immediately shows that l_tr_ in LaB_{6}, which has a room-temperature phonon resistivity \rho(300)-\rho(0)=8.9~\mu\Omega~cm,[38] is much weaker than l_tr_ in YB_{6}, for which \rho(300)-\rho(0)=28.4~\mu\Omega~cm. Indeed superconductivity has been reported to occur only below 0.1 K in LaB_{6}. More information on the possibilities and limitations of the deconvolution of the resistivity to obtain the \alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega) function may be found in the paper of Igalson _et al.[39]_

## VI Thermal expansivity and ANHAMMONICITY

Thermal-expansion experiments were undertaken to give three types of information: (i) confirmation of the main features of the PDOS, (ii) evaluation of the volume dependence of phonon modes and electronic density of states, and (iii) determination of the variation of _T_c with pressure. The linear thermal expansivity \alpha(T) for a cubic system is given by  \[\alpha(T)=\frac{1}{L}\biggl{(}\frac{\partial L}{\partial T}\biggr{)}_{p}=\frac{ \kappa_{T}}{3}\biggl{(}\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\biggr{)}_{T}\,,\] (17)

where \kappa_{T} is the isothermal compressibility. The expansivity is closely related to the specific heat at constant volume via the Gruneisen parameters (see, e.g., Ref. [34]):

\[\alpha(T)=\frac{\kappa_{T}}{3V}(\gamma_{G,el}C_{el}+\gamma_{G,ph}C_{ph})\,,\] (18)

where the electronic Gruneisen parameter \gamma_{G,el} = \,  The fractional volume dependences of the critical temperature and Sommerfeld constant are unusually large, 14 and 15, respectively. The fact that they are nearly equal is associated with the fact that the relative jumps of the expansivity and specific heat are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. This follows from Eqs. (18) and (20):

\[\left(\frac{\partial\ln T_{c}}{\partial\ln V}\right)_{T}=-\frac{\Delta\alpha/ \alpha_{el}(T_{c})}{\Delta C/C_{el}(T_{c})}\left(\frac{\partial\ln\gamma_{p}}{ \partial\ln V}\right)_{T}.\] (21)

The roles of the phonon modes and the EDOS in the volume dependence still have to be elucidated. If the transition temperature is derived from a McMillan-type relation,[41] by neglecting the volume dependence of the screened Coulomb repulsion parameter \mu^{*} and recalling that the Eliashberg function is strongly peaked, \alpha^{2}F(\omega)=\lambda\omega_{E}\delta(\omega-\omega_{E}), we obtain[34]

\[\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\ln V}=-\gamma_{G,ph}(\omega_{E})+f(\lambda_{ep},\mu^{*}) \frac{d\ln\lambda_{ep}}{d\ln V},\] (22)

where f(\lambda_{ep},\mu^{*}) is easily calculated from McMillan's equation and takes the value \sim1.5 in the present case with \lambda_{ep}\cong 1, \mu^{*}\cong 0.1. A second equation describes the fractional volume dependence of \gamma_{n}\propto N(E_{F})(1+\lambda_{ep}):

\[\frac{d\ln\gamma_{n}}{d\ln V}=\frac{d\ln N(E_{F})}{d\ln V}+\frac{\lambda_{ep}} {1+\lambda_{ep}}\frac{d\ln\lambda_{ep}}{d\ln V}.\] (23)

From Eqs. (22) and (23), \partial\ln N(E_{F})/\partial\ln V=8.2\pm 4 and \partial\ln\lambda_{ep}/\partial\ln V=13.7\pm 2. The variation of \gamma_{n} with the volume is therefore due to the variation of both the EDOS and the phonon-dependent renormalization in an approximately equal ratio.[42]

In a final step we may write \lambda_{ep}=\eta/M\omega_{E}^{2}, where \eta is the Hopfield electronic parameter. It follows that

\[\frac{d\ln\lambda_{ep}}{d\ln V}=\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V}+2\gamma_{G,ph}(\omega_ {E}).\] (24)

The first term of the right-hand side is found to be small, d\ln\eta/d\ln V=-0.3\pm 3, compared to the second one, 2\gamma_{G,pl}(\omega_{E})=14\pm 2. Therefore we may say that the large and positive values of \partial\ln\lambda_{ep}/\partial\ln V and \partial\ln T_{c}/\partial\ln V are essentially due to the anharmonicity of the 8-meV mode. When the volume of the boron cages increases, the force constant which determines the frequency of the strongly coupled soft mode decreases and the latter moves closer to the favorable region \approx6k_{B}T_{c} where the functional derivative \delta T_{c}/\delta\alpha^{2}F(\omega) is largest.[8]

## VII. Magnetic phase diagram

The superconducting phase diagram in the _H-T_ plane was investigated by magnetoresistance, magnetization, and specific heat measurements, allowing the critical fields H_{c1}(T), H_{c1}(T), H_{c2}(T), and H_{c3}(T) to be determined (Table 3). The resistive transitions in fields 0-0.5 T are shown in Fig. 11. They are measured with both the field and current parallel to the long axis of the crystal. The extrapolation of the steepest part of the transition to R=0 is used to define the surface critical field H_{c3}(T), which is well separated from H_{c2}(T) as already observed in the dodecaboride ZrB_{12}.[5]

The dc magnetization at temperatures from 2 to 6 K is shown in Fig. 12. Our data agree with those of Kunii _et al.[43]_. The shape is typical of a type-II superconductor. The sharp minimum at the border of the Meissner and mixed-state regions defines H_{c1}(T), and the break in the slope between the mixed-state and normal-state regions defines H_{c2}(T). It is remarkable that no anomaly can be detected in the magnetization at H_{c3}(T) where the resistance vanishes (Fig. 13), thus confirming the superficial nature of the third critical field. No anomaly is detected in the specific heat either at H_{c3}(T). Note that the scale of Fig. 13 is enlarged by a factor of 5000 with respect to that of Fig. 12. Although on this scale the transition at H_{c2} appears to be rounded, H_{c2} nevertheless remains well defined using an extrapolation of the linear parts from above and below the transition, as expected in the Ginzburg-Landau regime (Fig. 13, inset).

Figure 10: Difference between the normal-state and superconducting-state linear thermal expansivity near T_{c}. The idealized jump is shown by a dotted line. Inset: expansivity in the normal and superconducting states.

  Finally the specific heat was measured in several fields from 0 to 1 T. These measurements give an independent bulk determination of H_{c2}(T). The criterion used here is the midpoint of the step at the transition (Fig. 14). No anomaly is seen at H_{c1}(T), thus establishing that YB_{6} is a type-II/2 superconductor, unlike ZrB_{12} which was of type-II/1.[5] Note that in Fig. 14 only the electronic part C_{e}/T of the total specific heat is shown. The rise of C_{e}(H)/T with respect to the zero-field curve C_{e}(0)/T, shown in Fig. 15, is due to the contribution of quasi normal vortex cores and the excitations of the vortex lattice. The trends observed in the data suggest that the model of Caroli _et al.[44, 45]_--i.e. C_{e}(H)/T = \gamma_{e}H/H_{c2}(0)--would be obeyed at temperatures below \sim0.1T_{c}.

The above information is summarized in the phase diagram, Fig. 16. The Maki parameter \kappa_{1}(T) = 2^{-1/2}H_{c2}(T)/H_{c}(T) shown in the inset extrapolates to \kappa_{1}(T_{c}) = \kappa \equiv 3 and increases at low temperature as usual. Note that \kappa is too low for the approximate Ginzburg-Landau relation H_{c1}(T) \equiv 2^{-1/2}H_{c}(T)ln \kappa_{1}/\kappa_{1} to hold. Instead we use \kappa_{1}(T) to recalculate H_{c1}(T) according to the numerical work of Harden and Arp[46] (lower dashed line in Fig. 16). These recalculated values nevertheless underestimate H_{c1}(T) taken from magnetization curves by 10%-20%.

The critical field H_{c3}(T), which describes the persistence of superconductivity over a layer of thickness comparable to the coherence length \xi when the field is applied parallel to a flat surface, should ideally be 1.695H_{c2}(0).[47, 48] Indeed, at

Figure 13: Detail of the previous plot at T=5 K, expanded 100 times in the inset and 5000 times in the main frame. The normal-state magnetization M_{\rm n} has been subtracted. Note the absence of any measurable diamagnetism at H_{c3}=1700 G where the resistance drops to zero. Fluctuation diamagnetism sets in smoothly near 1500 G. The upper critical field H_{c3}=1270 G defined by the intersection of the extrapolated linear sections in the inset coincides with the position of the specific heat jump.

  2.4 K [the lowest temperature at which H_{c3}(T) could be measured], H_{c3}(T)/H_{c2}(T)=1.66. However, while H_{c2}(T) has a negative curvature which fits well with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory,[49]H_{c3}(T) has a small but positive curvature. Using a polynomial fit, H_{c3}(T) extrapolates to \sim2.2H_{c2}(0) at T=0 (Fig. 16). A qualitatively similar behavior was found in ZrB_{12},[5] This exceedingly large ratio may be explained here by a decrease in the mean free path with respect to the bulk over a thin layer at the surface. An increase of the gap at the surface with respect to the bulk volume [as found in ZrB_{12} (Refs. [4, 5, 50, and 51]) is excluded in YB_{6}, since in this case tunneling and specific heat determinations agree on the gap value.

## VIII Compositional dependence

A broad range of superconducting critical temperatures, 1.5 \leq T_{c} \leq 8.4 K, has been reported in the literature depending on the conditions of preparation.[9] In our preliminary work, T_{c} onsets from 6.5 to 7.6 K were obtained. Energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDX) revealed a correlation between T_{c} and the Y/B ratio, the higher T_{c} corresponding to a smaller boron concentration [T_{c}(YB_{6+x}) \equiv 6.25 -4.3x\pm 0.25 K]. Literature data confirm this tendency.[9] The lattice constant was found to be almost insensitive to the Y/B ratio, changing from 4.1002(5) A for YB_{5.7} with T_{c} =7.6 K to 4.1000(5) A for YB_{5.9} with T_{c}=6.6 K. These values are in agreement with published data.[9] The possible influence of strains on T_{c} cannot be excluded: the high value T_{c}=8.4 K reported by Fisk _et al.[3]_ was obtained by splat-cooling of arc-melted samples with nominal composition YB_{6}. We tried to "anneal out" residual strains in different samples by a 36-h heat treatment at 1600 degC in 100 bars argon pressure, followed by slow cooling. The T_{c} onset of low-T_{c} samples (6.5 K) did not change; that of high-T_{c} samples (7.6 -7.8 K) decreased by about half a kelvin. In all cases the main effect was a broadening of the transition by 2-3 K. While such experiments tend to support the idea that strains increase T_{c}, the effect of losses during the heat treatment cannot be excluded.

The highest T_{c} is obtained for a B/Y ratio below 6. In this sense the reference crystal with T_{c}=7.2 K studied in the previous sections is not ideal because of the presence of boron vacancies. Therefore we briefly studied two other crystals with T_{c}^{onset}=6.5 K and 7.6 K. Their resistivity was only found to differ from that of the reference sample by the residual term, while the temperature-dependent part remained unchanged (Table 5). Magnetization curves were measured with increasing field and integrated to get the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) (Fig. 17, Table 5). Irreversibility may introduce some error by delaying the entry of vortices, leading to an overestimation of H_{c}(T). However, we found that the magnetic determination of H_{c}(T) was only 4% above that obtained from the specific heat for the reference sample, showing that the branch with increasing field is close to equilibrium. The net result is that T_{c} is positively correlated with H_{c}(0), \gamma_{n}, and therefore the EDOS, as is the case for most

From top to bottom: third critical field H_{c3}(T) defined by zero resistance for H parallel to the current and surface, second upper critical field H_{c2}(T) given by the position of the specific heat jump (closed diamonds) and the knee of the magnetization (open diamonds), thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) obtained by integration of the specific heat C/T (open circles), and lower critical field H_{c1}(T) given by the position of the sharp minimum of the magnetization (solid circles). All lines are polynomial fits to the data, except for the H_{c1}(T) line, which is recalculated based on H_{c}(T) and the Maki parameter \kappa_{1}(T) (see text). Inset: variation of \kappa_{1} with the temperature.

  BCS superconductors. The change in the EDOS is confirmed by the dc magnetic susceptibility. The curve for the sample with T_{c}=6.5 K is similar to that shown in Fig. 2 and described by the parameters \chi(0)=-16.8\times10^{-6}, a=4.0 \times10^{-11} K^{-2}, and C_{\rm Curie}=6.5\times10^{-4} K (see Sec. II). Compared to the reference sample, the susceptibility is more diamagnetic, which is attributed to a smaller Pauli contribution. The Curie term is equivalent to 120 ppm Yb^{3+}.

## IX IX. Conclusion

Specific heat, resistivity, and thermal expansion experiments performed on high quality single crystals have been used to characterize YB_{6}. This superconductor has a low density of states at the Fermi level. Some sample dependence of T_{c} can be traced to the variation of the B/Y ratio, which in turn influences the EDOS. The specific heat in the superconducting state is typical of a single-band, isotropic BCS superconductor; however, the electron-phonon interaction is much stronger than for the other superconducting borides, in particular ZrB_{12} and MgB_{2}. A common feature of these borides is nonuniform coupling to selected phonon modes. Whereas the strongly coupled modes lie at high energy \sim60 meV for MgB_{2},[52] they lie at low energy \sim15 meV for ZrB_{12} (Ref. [4]) and \sim8 meV for YB_{6}, which partly explains their relatively low T_{c}. Similarly to LaB_{6},[29] these low-frequency modes are associated with the vibration of Y or Zr atoms loosely bound in oversized boron cages. The reason for the lower characteristic frequency in YB_{6} compared to ZrB_{12} is neither to be found in the mass of the metal ions nor in the coordination number which is 24 in both cases. It is rather to be associated with the longer metal to boron bond, 3.03 A in YB_{6} (Ref. [53]) instead of 2.76 A in ZrB_{12} (Ref. [54]). This longer distance leads to a weaker force constant and larger vibrational amplitude, which in turn favors superconductivity. The thermal expansion indeed indicates that T_{c} will decrease with pressure and that these modes are strongly anharmonic. As for magnetic properties, YB_{6} is a type-II superconductor with \kappa\equiv 3 and clearly shows a third upper critical field at the surface, a rather rare occurrence.

Owing to the low characteristic energy of the phonons which mediate superconducting pairing, YB_{6} has been found to be an almost ideal system where, on the one hand, specific heat can substitute for inelastic neutron scattering (which is plagued by the absorption of ^{10}B) to study the PDOS and, on the other hand, resistivity can be substituted for tunnelling to study the electron-phonon coupling function. The spectral resolution of these procedures is limited and only makes sense on a logarithmic energy scale; nevertheless, this technique is found to be reproducible and able to give remarkably consistent values of \lambda_{ep} allowing significant comparisons to be made between borides.

###### Abstract

The superconductor YB6 has the second highest critical temperature T_{c} among the boride family MB_{0}. We report measurements of the specific heat, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and thermal expansion from 2 to 300 K, using a single crystal with T_{c}=7.2 K. The superconducting gap is characteristic of medium-strong coupling. The specific heat, resistivity, and expansivity curves are deconvolved to yield approximations of the phonon density of states F(\omega), the spectral electron-phonon scattering function \sigma_{\omega}^{2}F(\omega), and the phonon density of states weighted by the frequency-dependent Gruneisen parameter \gamma_{G}(\omega)F(\omega), respectively. Lattice vibrations extend to high frequencies >100 meV, but a dominant Einstein-like mode at \sim8 meV, associated with the vibrations of yttrium ions in oversized boron cages, appears to provide most of the superconducting coupling and gives rise to an unusual temperature behavior of several observable quantities. A surface critical field H_{c3} is also observed.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity at \sim40 K in the metallic compound MgB_{2} (Refs. 1 and 2) has stimulated a renewed interest in borides. The next highest superconducting critical temperatures in the MB_{0} family are found in YB6 with T_{c}\,\leq\,8.4 K and ZrB12 with T_{c}=6.0 K.[3] These compounds are hard materials with a low density of states at the Fermi level. Their crystal structure--CaB_{6} type (bcc, Pm\bar{3}m-O_{b}^{1}) for YB6 and UB_{12} type (fcc, Fm\bar{3}m-O_{b}^{5}) for ZrB12--is three dimensional and characterized by boron cages in which yttrium or zirconium atoms can develop large vibrational amplitudes. The metal-boron distance (2.76 A in ZrB12 and 3.01 A in YB6) is remarkably large, giving rise to unusual properties. ZrB12 was recently investigated with respect to its specific heat, resistivity, thermal expansion, and magnetic properties.[4, 5] Characteristic features of ZrB12 were type-II/1 superconductivity,[6] an enhanced gap and critical field at the surface, and weak electron-phonon coupling essentially driven by a single anharmonic mode at 14 meV. In this work we turn to YB6, the specific heat of which was only briefly mentioned in an early paper,[7] and find that some of these peculiarities are also present and even more dramatic. Here, a corresponding anharmonic lattice mode has softened to 8 meV, giving rise to a very unusual temperature dependence of the specific heat, resistivity, and expansivity. This effect is so marked that YB6 can be considered as a textbook example of superconductivity in an Einstein lattice, a limiting situation where strong-coupling theory is well assessed.[8] Another consequence of having low-energy modes is that "thermal" spectroscopies--i.e., experiments sensitive to a density of energy states convolved with a thermal distribution--become efficient. In this work we show that specific heat and resistivity can indeed provide information usually taken from inelastic neutron scattering and tunneling spectroscopy, with a limited but sufficient accuracy to characterize the superconducting coupling at a quantitative level.

This article is organized as follows. In Sec. II experimental details and basic sample characterizations are given. The electronic specific heat is analyzed in Sec. III. Sections IV-VI are devoted to the deconvolution of the specific heat, resistivity, and thermal expansivity curves to obtain information on the phonon density of states F(\omega), electron-phonon transport coupling function \alpha_{\nu}^{2}F(\omega), and frequency-dependent Gruneisen parameter \gamma_{G}(\omega), respectively. The magnetic phase diagram with four critical field lines is established in Sec. VII, based on different experiments. The compositional dependence is briefly addressed in Sec. VIII, before concluding in Sec. IX. A wealth of experimental information is already available for YB6 in the literature, and we refer to Ref. 9 for a review.

## II Crystal growth and experimental details

The preparation of single crystals of yttrium hexaboride involved several steps: synthesis of YB6 powder by borothermal reduction of Y_{2}O_{3}, compacting the powder into rods, sintering, and zone melting by inductive heating. Since the superconducting critical temperature of YB6 is particularly sensitive to impurities, 99.999%-pure Y_{2}O_{3} powder and >99.5% amorphous boron were used as starting materials. The highly volatile impurities contained in the latter were eliminated during the synthesis and zone melting procedures, resulting in a total impurity concentration in the crystals under study of at most 0.001% in weight.

Taking into account the genetic melting of YB6 (Ref. 10) and previous results on crystal growth,[11] we synthesized  the initial powders with excess boron in order to lower the melting temperature. High-quality single crystals were obtained for a source composition B/Y > 6.8. Other important technological parameters were the pressure of argon gas, 1.3 MPa, and the growth rate, 13 mm/h. The growth was unstable over the first few mm, yielding a two-phase mixture of YB4 and YB6. The process subsequently stabilized and at a definite B/Y ratio a single-phase ingot started to grow. Due to concurrent growth, one grain grew at the expense of the others and approximately \langle 100\rangle-oriented single crystals were obtained with a length of about 30 mm.

The as-grown single crystal used for nearly all subsequent experiments was shaped into a parallelepiped bar by spark cutting and then polished using abrasive diamond paste. Its dimensions are \sim12 \times 3 \times 1.5 mm^{3} and mass 73.5 mg, with the long axis parallel to the \langle 100\rangle direction and the facets perpendicular to \langle 010\rangle and \langle 001\rangle. Measurements in a magnetic field were taken with the field along the length of the sample in order to minimize the demagnetization factor (D\cong 0.03). The superconducting transition temperature T_{c} was determined by four methods: resistivity [Fig. 1(a)], ac susceptibility [Fig. 1(b)], dc magnetization [Fig. 1(c)], and specific-heat jump at T_{c} (see Fig. 3 below) which, in this order, are increasingly representative of the bulk volume. On average, T_{c}\cong 7.2 K, the transition width being \sim2% of T_{c} (Table 1).

The dc resistivity \rho was measured by a four-lead technique with current reversal, using a 5 mA current. The contacts were made with Degussa "Leitsilber 200" conducting silver paint. The residual resistivity ratio was \rho(300 K)/\rho(2 K) = 3.87. The residual resistivity \rho(2 K) = 9.9 \mu\Omega cm was determined in a magnetic field of 5 T to quench superconductivity; the resistivity did not vary appreciably below 9 K. No significant magnetoresistance was observed in the normal state.

The magnetization M was measured in a Quantum Design MPMS-5 magnetometer, using a scan length of 4 cm. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) susceptibility in the Meissner state was measured in a field of 2.7 Oe, which is \sim1% of the lower critical field at T= 0 [Fig. 1(c)]. The normal-state susceptibility \chi(T) was obtained from the initial slope of M(H) measured at 1-T intervals from 0 to 5 T. The core and Pauli contributions nearly cancel each other, resulting in a small and slightly diamagnetic susceptibility. A Curie component develops at low temperature, possibly due to traces of magnetic rare earth metals in the Y starting material (Fig. 2). The best fit is obtained by allowing a second-order term in the Pauli susceptibility:

\[\chi(T)=\chi(0)+aT^{2}+\frac{C_{Curie}}{T}.\] (1)

The fitted parameters are (S.I.) \chi(0)= -9.6 \times 10^{-6}, a= 2.4 \times 10^{-11} K^{-2}, and C_{Curie}= 1.8 \times 10^{-4} K. The Curie term is equivalent to 35 ppm at. Yb^{3+}.

The specific heat was measured by a generalized relaxation technique at low temperature (1.2-15 K) (Ref. 12) and in an adiabatic, continuous-heating calorimeter at high temperature (16-300 K).^{12} Care was taken to measure the re

  sidual field of the 14 T magnet mounted in the cryostat, compensating this when required. Specific heat runs were taken after cooling in a field from above T_{c} in order to achieve the best possible field penetration.

A high-resolution capacitance dilatometer [13, 14] was used to measure the thermal expansion in the temperature range 3-250 K. Data were taken both upon heating and cooling at a constant rate of 5 mK/s at low temperatures (3-15 K) and at 20 mK/s up to 250 K. Flowing He exchange gas (0-4 mbar) was used to thermally couple the sample to the dilatometer.

## III Electron-specific heat, density of states, and coupling strength

The specific heat at low temperature in both the superconducting (H=0) and normal state (H=1 T) is shown in Fig. 3. The superconducting-state specific heat C_{s} shows a sharp second-order jump at T_{c}. It vanishes at T\rightarrow 0 in a somewhat unusual way, since C_{s}/T tends to a finite value \gamma_{0} = 0.03 mJ K^{-2} gat^{-1} rather than zero as would be expected in a fully gapped state (one gram-atom [gat] is one Avogadro's number of atoms, here one-seventh of a mole (Table 2). This residual contribution, which may be due to an extrinsic non-superconducting fraction or to a gapless electron band, will not be discussed further as it only represents \sim5% of the normal-state electronic specific heat. The normal-state specific heat is analyzed in a standard way according to the expansion

\[C_{n}(T\to 0)=\gamma_{n}T+\sum_{n=1}^{3}\beta_{2n+1}T^{2n+1},\] (2)

where the first term is the electronic contribution, with \gamma_{n} =\frac{1}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda_{ep})N(E_{F}), k_{B} Boltzmann's constant, \lambda_{ep} the electron-phonon coupling constant and N(E_{F}) the band-structure density of states at the Fermi level including two spin directions [electronic density of states (EDOS)]. The second term is the low-temperature expansion of the lattice specific heat, where \beta_{3}=\frac{12}{5}N_{Au}k_{B}\pi^{4}\theta_{D}^{3}(0), with N_{Au} Avogadro's number and \theta_{D}(0) the initial Debye temperature. From a fit of the normal-state data from 1.2 to 7.5 K, we obtain \gamma_{n}=0.58 mJ K^{-2} gat^{-1} and \theta_{D}(0)=706 K (369 K if according to another convention only acoustic modes are considered). The Sommerfeld constant \gamma_{n}, which is \sim50% larger than that mentioned by Matthias _et al._, [7] corresponds to a renormalized EDOS (1+\lambda_{ep})N(E_{F})=1.73 eV^{-1} cell^{-1}. The band structure has been calculated by several groups. [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] Comparing the renormalized EDOS with the recently obtained values N(E_{F})= 0.82 (Ref. [19]), 0.83 (Ref. [20]), and 0.93 (Ref. [21]) eV^{-1} cell^{-1}, we find room for an electron-phonon renormalization factor \approx2--i.e., \lambda_{ep}=1.12, 1.08, and 0.86, respectively. The value \lambda_{ep}^{\infty}1 is supported by independent determinations. For example, we may start from \Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c}, the normalized specific heat jump at T_{c}, as a well-defined input observable. From there we evaluate T_{c}/\omega_{\rm in}=0.071 using isotropic single-band strong-coupling formulas representing interpolated solutions of Eliashberg equations (Eq. 5.9 of Ref. [8]; \omega_{\rm in} is the logarithmic moment exp[\int\ln\omega a^{2}F(\omega)d\omega/\omega/\int\alpha^{2}F(\omega)d\omega/\omega] of the Eliashberg

  function \alpha^{2}F(\omega)). Assuming the conventional value \mu^{*} =0.10 for the Coulomb pseudopotential,[22] we obtain \lambda_{ep} = 1.01 according to the Allen-Dynes equation.[22] A change of \pm0.05 in \mu^{*} affects the value of \lambda_{ep} by \pm0.15. In Sec. V we give a third independent determination \lambda_{ep}=1.04 which relies on the electrical and optical conductivity and confirms the first two calculations. At this point we already wish to draw attention to the low value \omega_{\rm ln}=101 K \ll\theta_{D}(0)=706 K that results from this analysis. YB_{6} is characterized by selective electron-phonon coupling to low-frequency modes.

The thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) is obtained by numerical integration of the specific heat data (Table 3):

\[-\frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}VH_{c}^{2}(T)=\Delta U(T)-T\Delta S(T),\]

\[\Delta U(T)=\int_{T}^{T_{c}}\left[C_{s}(T^{\prime})-C_{n}(T^{\prime})\right]dT ^{\prime},\]

\[\Delta S(T)=\int_{T}^{T_{c}}\frac{C_{s}(T^{\prime})-C_{n}(T^{\prime})}{T^{ \prime}}dT^{\prime},\] (3)

where the volume V and other specific quantities refer to 1 g at. H_{c}(T) is nearly parabolic and extrapolates to 55 mT at T=0 (see Fig. 16, below). The deviation function D(t)\equivh-(1-t^{2}), where h=H_{c}(T)/H_{c}(0) and t=T/T_{c}, is a good indicator of the coupling strength.[8] The curve for YB_{6} (Fig. 4, inset) is very similar to that of Nb_{77}Zr_{23}, for which 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\equiv 4.2,[23] and is bounded by those of Nb and Hg, for which 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\equiv 4.0 and 4.6, respectively.[8] Other estimations of the gap ratio rely on the slope of the BCS semi-logarithmic plot (Fig. 4),[24] the normalized specific heat jump at T_{c} [Eq. (4.1) of Ref. [8]], or a fit of the \alpha model.[25] These determinations consistently yield 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=4.1\pm0.1 and only differ by the weighting given to different temperature ranges. Finally we recall tunneling measurements giving 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=4.02 and \lambda_{ep}=0.90 (with \mu^{*}=0).[26] All these determinations provide evidence for medium- to strong-coupling superconductivity in YB_{6}. In this respect, YB_{6} differs from ZrB_{12} which is a weakly coupled superconductor (Table 2).[4, 5]

Finally, note that the shape of the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state excludes d-wave superconductivity. In particular, in the latter case the dimensionless ratio \gamma_{n}T_{c}^{2}/\mu_{0}VH_{c}^{2}(0) would be nearly twice as large (3.7) as that observed (2.00\pm0.05).[27]

## IV IV. Lattice specific heat and phonon density of states

The low-temperature T^{3} regime of the lattice specific heat does not extend beyond a few kelvin, as shown by the large positive curvature of the normal-state curve in Fig. 3. Huge deviations with respect to the ideal Debye model persist at higher temperature (Fig. 5). The shape of the lattice specific heat in the C/T plot is very uncommon, exhibiting a large low-temperature peak (Fig. 6). The specific heat at room temperature reaches only \sim56% of the Dulong-Petit value, showing that the thermal energy at 300 K is still too low to excite all the spectral modes. The effective Debye temperature \theta_{eff}(T) is defined as the value of \theta necessary to fit the experimental specific heat at any T with the equation

\[C_{ph}(T)=9N_{Av}k_{B}\left(\frac{T}{\theta}\right)^{3}\int_{0}^{\theta T} \frac{x^{4}e^{x}}{(e^{x}-1)^{2}}dx.\] (4)

We have assumed C_{ph}=C_{total}-\gamma_{n}T, neglecting the anharmonic specific heat. This is justified by the estimation C_{p}-C_{v}=(3\alpha)^{2}BVT, where B\equiv 190 GPa is the bulk modulus and \alpha\equiv 6.1\times10^{-6} K^{-1}, the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (see Sec. VI); (C_{p}-C_{v})/C_{p}\simeq 0.8% at 250 K. The electronic term \gamma_{n}T only represents \sim1% of C_{total} at room temperature. Starting from its initial value \theta_{eff}(0)=\theta_{D}(0) =706 K, the effective Debye temperature passes through a

  deep minimum \theta_{epf}(16 K) = 278 K, then increases monotonically, suggesting an asymptotic value between 1100 and 1200 K. Its room-temperature value is \theta_{eff}(300 K) = 1088 K. Figure 5 shows the ideal Debye specific heat for selected values of the Debye temperature. It is clear that the data do not match any curve with a constant \theta_{D}. These plots point towards a large phonon density of states (PDOS) at energies of the order of 80-100 K. Analogous situations occur--albeit to a lesser extent--in Na and Al due to the presence of optical phonons [28] and in the borides ZrB_{12} (Ref. [4]) and LaB_{6} (Ref. [29]), for example. The specific-heat data at high temperature are sufficiently minimally scattered to attempt a deconvolution of C_{ph}(T) to extract the PDOS F(\omega). More precisely, we can only obtain a substitutional spectrum--i.e. a smoothed phonon density of states \widetilde{F}(\omega) which precisely reproduces the specific heat and low-order moments of F(\omega) but may not show the true PDOS in detail. A simplified method consists of representing F(\omega) by a basis of Einstein modes with constant spacing on a logarithmic frequency axis:

\[F(\omega)=\sum_{k}F_{k}\delta(\omega-\omega_{k}).\] (5)

The corresponding lattice specific heat is given by

\[C_{ph}(T)=3N_{A\omega}k_{B}\sum_{k}F_{k}\frac{x_{k}^{2}e^{x_{k}}}{(e^{x_{k}}- 1)^{2}},\] (6)

where x_{k}= \omega_{k}/T. The weights F_{k} are found by a least-squares fit of the lattice specific heat. The number of modes is chosen to be small enough to ensure the stability of the solution; a practical choice is \omega_{k+1}/\omega_{k}= 1.75. Note that we do not try to find the energy of each mode; we aim rather at establishing a histogram of the density in predefined frequency bins. The robustness of the fit (rms deviation <0.2% above 16 K) is demonstrated by the reproducibility of the results of two independent runs over slightly different temperature ranges (Table 4). The sum of weights exceeds the ideal value 1 by 10%; most probably part of the fitted weight in the highest-energy modes in this harmonic model only serves to simulate the anharmonic contribution. Table 4 also gives the generalized moments

\[\widetilde{\omega}_{\rm ln}=\exp\left(\frac{\int\omega^{-1}\ln\omega F(\omega) d\omega}{\int\omega^{-1}F(\omega)d\omega}\right),\] (7)

\[\langle\widetilde{\omega}^{2}\rangle^{1/2}\equiv\left(\frac{\int\omega F( \omega)d\omega}{\int\omega^{-1}F(\omega)d\omega}\right)^{1/2},\] (8)

to be compared later with similar moments of the Eliashberg function \alpha^{2}F(\omega). Figure 6 illustrates the decomposition of the lattice-specific heat into Einstein contributions. The PDOS obtained in this way is shown in Fig. 9 below. It consists of a background with a high cutoff frequency, as expected in view of the light and rigid boron sublattice, superposed onto a strong peak at \sim8 meV which is associated with nearly free oscillations of the Y atoms in oversized boron cages. The relative weight of the latter peak, \sim10% (\sim15% if we include both neighboring energy bins), is of the order of the fraction of Y atoms per formula unit. The question therefore arises as to what extent this low-energy region of the PDOS contributes to the electron-phonon coupling. Different answers have been given in the literature, with the main coupling being attributed to either the boron sublattice [16] or translational modes involving the yttrium ions [26]. This point is addressed in the next section, using resistivity as an experimental probe.

  A comparison with standard determinations of the PDOS is instructive. YB_{6} has been studied by inelastic incoherent neutron scattering on polycrystals.[30] According to this unpublished work, the GDOS, i.e., the generalized PDOS weighted by the scattering cross sections of the Y and B atoms, extends to about 200 meV and exhibits a low-frequency peak at \sim10 meV.[16] However, the integrated GDOS up to 15 meV only contains 1.3% of the total weight, one order of magnitude below the result from the specific heat. The GDOS and the true PDOS are expected to differ in the present case owing to the different scattering cross sections of yttrium and boron. A determination of the PDOS by inelastic neutron scattering on single crystals is not available for YB_{6}, but dispersion curves up to \sim60 meV are known for the isostructural compounds LaB_{6} and SmB_{6}.[31, 32] In both cases, it was found that the optical modes are separated from the acoustic ones by a wide gap, which can be observed around 24 meV in the PDOS of YB_{6} derived from the specific heat (Fig. 9 below). It was also pointed out that the acoustic modes of LaB_{6} (SmB_{6}), both longitudinal and transverse, are unusually flat over the major part of the Brillouin zone, due to the noninteracting vibration of the La (Sm) ion. This gives rise to a low-frequency peak at \sim2.5-3 THz (\sim10-12 meV) in the PDOS. Although yttrium is lighter, this peak lies at \sim8 meV in YB_{6} according to the specific heat. This softening is associated with the weaker bond due to the smaller radius of the metal ion, while the size of the boron cage undergoes little change.

High frequency modes have been studied by Raman techniques in the hexaboride series (see Ref. [33] and references therein). They are associated with "internal" modes of the boron octahedra. Their energies cannot be resolved by the deconvolution of the specific heat, but their weight is included in the highest two frequency bins.

## V Resistivity and Electron-Phonon Coupling

The resistivity (Fig. 7) is analyzed in a similar way. We start from the generalized Bloch-Gruneisen formula (see, e.g., Ref. [34], in particular pp. 212 and 219)

\[\rho_{BG}(T)=\rho(0)+\frac{4\,\pi m^{*}}{ne^{2}}\int_{0}^{\omega_{\rm max}} \alpha_{\rho}^{2}F(\omega)\frac{xe^{x}}{\left(e^{x}-1\right)^{2}}d\omega,\] (9)

where x\equiv\omega/T and \alpha_{\rho}^{2}F(\omega) is the electron-phonon "transport coupling function." In the restricted Bloch-Gruneisen approach, one would have \alpha_{\rho}^{2}F(\omega)\propto\omega^{4}, and as a consequence

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline  & F_{k}/\omega_{k} (eV^{-1}) & \lambda_{tr,k}=(\alpha_{\rho}^{2}F_{k})/\omega_{k} \\  & First run, 2-300 K, H=1 T & First run, 2-300 K, H=5 T \\ \omega_{k} (meV) & (second run, 16-300 K, H=0) & (second run, 7.5-300 K, H=0) \\ \hline
127 & 3.37 (3.40) & 0 (0) \\
72.7 & 4.60 (4.61) & 0.101 (0.117) \\
41.6 & 4.07 (4.01) & 0 (0) \\
23.8 & 0.80 (0.93) & 0 (0) \\
13.6 & 3.37 (3.21) & 0 (0.006) \\
7.76 & 13.0 (13.1)  \rho_{BC}(T)-\rho(0)\propto T^{5}, but deviations from the Debye model, complications with phonon polarizations, and umklapp processes would not justify this simplification beyond the low-temperature continuum limit--i.e., only a few kelvin in this case. Using a decomposition into a basis of Einstein modes similar to Eq. (5),

\[\alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k}\lambda_{tr,k}\omega_{k}\delta( \omega-\omega_{k}),\] (10)

we obtain the discrete version of Eq. (9):

\[\rho_{BG}(T)=\rho(0)+\frac{2\pi}{\varepsilon_{0}\Omega_{p}^{2}}\sum_{k}\lambda _{tr,k}\omega_{k}\frac{x_{k}e^{x_{k}}}{(e^{x_{k}}-1)^{2}},\] (11)

where the fitting parameters are the dimensionless constants l_tr,k_. The constraint l_tr,k_ >= 0 is enforced. The residual resistivity \rho(0)=9.9~\mu\Omega~cm is determined separately (inset of Fig. 7). The unscreened plasma frequency O_p_ = (_ne_2/_e_0m1)1/2 = 5.2 eV is taken from extensive optical spectroscopy experiments performed on the same single crystal, to be published elsewhere.[21] The negative curvature of the resistivity at high temperature, a rather general phenomenon possibly related to the Mott limit,[35, 36] is taken into account by the empirical "parallel-resistor" formula[37]

\[\frac{1}{\rho(T)}=\frac{1}{\rho_{BG}(T)+\rho(0)}+\frac{1}{\rho_{\max}}.\] (12)

The parameter _r_max = 73 _m_O cm is fitted simultaneously to the parameters l_tr,k_, using data taken in either H = 0 (_T_c  T  8 300 K) or 5 T (2.2  T  8 300 K). These two data sets are fitted independently (rms error ~0.2%) in order to evaluate the robustness of the results (Table 4). Only a few basis modes contribute. Two low-energy modes at ~8 and ~4.5 meV clearly stand out (Fig. 9 below), in agreement with tunneling data featuring a peak in the Eliashberg function \alpha^{2}F(\omega) at 8.5 meV and a shoulder at ~5 meV.[26] The electron-phonon coupling parameter relevant for transport _kr_ = 2 _to_-1 \alpha_{tr}^{-1}\rho_{tr}^{2}F(\omega) is obtained from l_tr_ = _k_l_tr,k_ = 1.04. Within experimental accuracy, it is equal to the electron-phonon coupling parameter relevant for superconductivity obtained in the previous section, _kp_ = 2 _to_-1 \alpha^{2}F(\omega) = 1.01. This is expected for phonon-mediated superconductors,[22, 34] but demonstrated experimentally in the present case. Finally, the value of _o_ln given by

\[\omega_{\ln}=\exp\left(\frac{\int\omega^{-1}\ln\omega a_{tr}^{2}F(\omega)d \omega}{\int\omega^{-1}\alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega)d\omega}\right)=\exp\left( \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\ln\omega_{k}\right)\] (13)

and the alternative determination of _o_ln obtained from the dimensionless specific heat jump in Sec. III both give the same value, 8.7 meV. Numerical results are summarized in Table 4, including the generalized second moment

\[\langle\omega^{2}\rangle^{1/2}=\left(\frac{\int\omega\alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega) d\omega}{\int\omega^{-1}\alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega)d\omega}\right)^{1/2}=\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\omega_{k}^{2}\right)^{1/2}.\] (14)

When compared with thermodynamic data, the analysis of the dc and optical conductivity therefore leads to the conclusion that superconductivity is essentially driven by a single low-energy mode (or a narrow group of modes), since _o_ln is very close to the low-frequency peak of the PDOS. This conclusion, which is at odds with early electronic-structure and phonon-mode calculations,[16] fully supports tunneling spectroscopy experiments.[26] YB_{6} is an almost local case of a superconductor with an Einstein PDOS. Just as in ZrB_{12},[4] most of the electron-phonon coupling arises from the large-amplitude, low-frequency vibrations of the loosely bound metal atoms in the oversized boron cages.

More generally, it is interesting to note that the resistivity equation (11) can be reexpressed in a form that emphasizes the similarity with the specific heat [Eq. (6)]:

\[\frac{\rho_{BG}(T)-\rho(0)}{T}=\frac{R_{0}k_{B}}{\varepsilon_{0}V_{p}^{2}} \sum_{k}\lambda_{tr,k}E(T/T_{k}),\] (15)

where R_{0}\equiv h/e^{2}=25.8~kO is the quantum of resistance, V_{p} the plasma frequency in volts, and E(x)=x^{2}e^{x}/(e^{x}-1)^{2} the normalized Einstein specific heat at a temperature T due to a mode with a characteristic temperature _T__{k}. In the case of coupling to a single mode, this reduces to

\[\frac{\rho_{BG}(T)-\rho(0)}{C_{ph}T}=\frac{R_{0}k_{B}}{\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{ \lambda_{tr}}{\upsilon_{p}^{2}}=\text{const}.\] (16)

This scaling of C_{ph} and [\rho_{BG}(T)-\rho(0)]/T is approximately obeyed in ZrB_{12} and YB_{6} due to the predominance of one soft mode. Grimvall[34] noted that a similar relation holds in the high-temperature limit for any number of modes. As no large variation is expected in the plasma frequency O_p_ \cong(e^{2}/\varepsilon_{0}m_{v}V_{cell})^{1/2} of trivalent hexaborides which have one free carrier per unit cell,[9] Eq. (16) immediately shows that l_tr_ in LaB_{6}, which has a room-temperature phonon resistivity \rho(300)-\rho(0)=8.9~\mu\Omega~cm,[38] is much weaker than l_tr_ in YB_{6}, for which \rho(300)-\rho(0)=28.4~\mu\Omega~cm. Indeed superconductivity has been reported to occur only below 0.1 K in LaB_{6}. More information on the possibilities and limitations of the deconvolution of the resistivity to obtain the \alpha_{tr}^{2}F(\omega) function may be found in the paper of Igalson _et al.[39]_

## VI Thermal expansivity and ANHAMMONICITY

Thermal-expansion experiments were undertaken to give three types of information: (i) confirmation of the main features of the PDOS, (ii) evaluation of the volume dependence of phonon modes and electronic density of states, and (iii) determination of the variation of _T_c with pressure. The linear thermal expansivity \alpha(T) for a cubic system is given by  \[\alpha(T)=\frac{1}{L}\biggl{(}\frac{\partial L}{\partial T}\biggr{)}_{p}=\frac{ \kappa_{T}}{3}\biggl{(}\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\biggr{)}_{T}\,,\] (17)

where \kappa_{T} is the isothermal compressibility. The expansivity is closely related to the specific heat at constant volume via the Gruneisen parameters (see, e.g., Ref. [34]):

\[\alpha(T)=\frac{\kappa_{T}}{3V}(\gamma_{G,el}C_{el}+\gamma_{G,ph}C_{ph})\,,\] (18)

where the electronic Gruneisen parameter \gamma_{G,el} = \,  The fractional volume dependences of the critical temperature and Sommerfeld constant are unusually large, 14 and 15, respectively. The fact that they are nearly equal is associated with the fact that the relative jumps of the expansivity and specific heat are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. This follows from Eqs. (18) and (20):

\[\left(\frac{\partial\ln T_{c}}{\partial\ln V}\right)_{T}=-\frac{\Delta\alpha/ \alpha_{el}(T_{c})}{\Delta C/C_{el}(T_{c})}\left(\frac{\partial\ln\gamma_{p}}{ \partial\ln V}\right)_{T}.\] (21)

The roles of the phonon modes and the EDOS in the volume dependence still have to be elucidated. If the transition temperature is derived from a McMillan-type relation,[41] by neglecting the volume dependence of the screened Coulomb repulsion parameter \mu^{*} and recalling that the Eliashberg function is strongly peaked, \alpha^{2}F(\omega)=\lambda\omega_{E}\delta(\omega-\omega_{E}), we obtain[34]

\[\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\ln V}=-\gamma_{G,ph}(\omega_{E})+f(\lambda_{ep},\mu^{*}) \frac{d\ln\lambda_{ep}}{d\ln V},\] (22)

where f(\lambda_{ep},\mu^{*}) is easily calculated from McMillan's equation and takes the value \sim1.5 in the present case with \lambda_{ep}\cong 1, \mu^{*}\cong 0.1. A second equation describes the fractional volume dependence of \gamma_{n}\propto N(E_{F})(1+\lambda_{ep}):

\[\frac{d\ln\gamma_{n}}{d\ln V}=\frac{d\ln N(E_{F})}{d\ln V}+\frac{\lambda_{ep}} {1+\lambda_{ep}}\frac{d\ln\lambda_{ep}}{d\ln V}.\] (23)

From Eqs. (22) and (23), \partial\ln N(E_{F})/\partial\ln V=8.2\pm 4 and \partial\ln\lambda_{ep}/\partial\ln V=13.7\pm 2. The variation of \gamma_{n} with the volume is therefore due to the variation of both the EDOS and the phonon-dependent renormalization in an approximately equal ratio.[42]

In a final step we may write \lambda_{ep}=\eta/M\omega_{E}^{2}, where \eta is the Hopfield electronic parameter. It follows that

\[\frac{d\ln\lambda_{ep}}{d\ln V}=\frac{d\ln\eta}{d\ln V}+2\gamma_{G,ph}(\omega_ {E}).\] (24)

The first term of the right-hand side is found to be small, d\ln\eta/d\ln V=-0.3\pm 3, compared to the second one, 2\gamma_{G,pl}(\omega_{E})=14\pm 2. Therefore we may say that the large and positive values of \partial\ln\lambda_{ep}/\partial\ln V and \partial\ln T_{c}/\partial\ln V are essentially due to the anharmonicity of the 8-meV mode. When the volume of the boron cages increases, the force constant which determines the frequency of the strongly coupled soft mode decreases and the latter moves closer to the favorable region \approx6k_{B}T_{c} where the functional derivative \delta T_{c}/\delta\alpha^{2}F(\omega) is largest.[8]

## VII. Magnetic phase diagram

The superconducting phase diagram in the _H-T_ plane was investigated by magnetoresistance, magnetization, and specific heat measurements, allowing the critical fields H_{c1}(T), H_{c1}(T), H_{c2}(T), and H_{c3}(T) to be determined (Table 3). The resistive transitions in fields 0-0.5 T are shown in Fig. 11. They are measured with both the field and current parallel to the long axis of the crystal. The extrapolation of the steepest part of the transition to R=0 is used to define the surface critical field H_{c3}(T), which is well separated from H_{c2}(T) as already observed in the dodecaboride ZrB_{12}.[5]

The dc magnetization at temperatures from 2 to 6 K is shown in Fig. 12. Our data agree with those of Kunii _et al.[43]_. The shape is typical of a type-II superconductor. The sharp minimum at the border of the Meissner and mixed-state regions defines H_{c1}(T), and the break in the slope between the mixed-state and normal-state regions defines H_{c2}(T). It is remarkable that no anomaly can be detected in the magnetization at H_{c3}(T) where the resistance vanishes (Fig. 13), thus confirming the superficial nature of the third critical field. No anomaly is detected in the specific heat either at H_{c3}(T). Note that the scale of Fig. 13 is enlarged by a factor of 5000 with respect to that of Fig. 12. Although on this scale the transition at H_{c2} appears to be rounded, H_{c2} nevertheless remains well defined using an extrapolation of the linear parts from above and below the transition, as expected in the Ginzburg-Landau regime (Fig. 13, inset).

Figure 10: Difference between the normal-state and superconducting-state linear thermal expansivity near T_{c}. The idealized jump is shown by a dotted line. Inset: expansivity in the normal and superconducting states.

  Finally the specific heat was measured in several fields from 0 to 1 T. These measurements give an independent bulk determination of H_{c2}(T). The criterion used here is the midpoint of the step at the transition (Fig. 14). No anomaly is seen at H_{c1}(T), thus establishing that YB_{6} is a type-II/2 superconductor, unlike ZrB_{12} which was of type-II/1.[5] Note that in Fig. 14 only the electronic part C_{e}/T of the total specific heat is shown. The rise of C_{e}(H)/T with respect to the zero-field curve C_{e}(0)/T, shown in Fig. 15, is due to the contribution of quasi normal vortex cores and the excitations of the vortex lattice. The trends observed in the data suggest that the model of Caroli _et al.[44, 45]_--i.e. C_{e}(H)/T = \gamma_{e}H/H_{c2}(0)--would be obeyed at temperatures below \sim0.1T_{c}.

The above information is summarized in the phase diagram, Fig. 16. The Maki parameter \kappa_{1}(T) = 2^{-1/2}H_{c2}(T)/H_{c}(T) shown in the inset extrapolates to \kappa_{1}(T_{c}) = \kappa \equiv 3 and increases at low temperature as usual. Note that \kappa is too low for the approximate Ginzburg-Landau relation H_{c1}(T) \equiv 2^{-1/2}H_{c}(T)ln \kappa_{1}/\kappa_{1} to hold. Instead we use \kappa_{1}(T) to recalculate H_{c1}(T) according to the numerical work of Harden and Arp[46] (lower dashed line in Fig. 16). These recalculated values nevertheless underestimate H_{c1}(T) taken from magnetization curves by 10%-20%.

The critical field H_{c3}(T), which describes the persistence of superconductivity over a layer of thickness comparable to the coherence length \xi when the field is applied parallel to a flat surface, should ideally be 1.695H_{c2}(0).[47, 48] Indeed, at

Figure 13: Detail of the previous plot at T=5 K, expanded 100 times in the inset and 5000 times in the main frame. The normal-state magnetization M_{\rm n} has been subtracted. Note the absence of any measurable diamagnetism at H_{c3}=1700 G where the resistance drops to zero. Fluctuation diamagnetism sets in smoothly near 1500 G. The upper critical field H_{c3}=1270 G defined by the intersection of the extrapolated linear sections in the inset coincides with the position of the specific heat jump.

  2.4 K [the lowest temperature at which H_{c3}(T) could be measured], H_{c3}(T)/H_{c2}(T)=1.66. However, while H_{c2}(T) has a negative curvature which fits well with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory,[49]H_{c3}(T) has a small but positive curvature. Using a polynomial fit, H_{c3}(T) extrapolates to \sim2.2H_{c2}(0) at T=0 (Fig. 16). A qualitatively similar behavior was found in ZrB_{12},[5] This exceedingly large ratio may be explained here by a decrease in the mean free path with respect to the bulk over a thin layer at the surface. An increase of the gap at the surface with respect to the bulk volume [as found in ZrB_{12} (Refs. [4, 5, 50, and 51]) is excluded in YB_{6}, since in this case tunneling and specific heat determinations agree on the gap value.

## VIII Compositional dependence

A broad range of superconducting critical temperatures, 1.5 \leq T_{c} \leq 8.4 K, has been reported in the literature depending on the conditions of preparation.[9] In our preliminary work, T_{c} onsets from 6.5 to 7.6 K were obtained. Energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDX) revealed a correlation between T_{c} and the Y/B ratio, the higher T_{c} corresponding to a smaller boron concentration [T_{c}(YB_{6+x}) \equiv 6.25 -4.3x\pm 0.25 K]. Literature data confirm this tendency.[9] The lattice constant was found to be almost insensitive to the Y/B ratio, changing from 4.1002(5) A for YB_{5.7} with T_{c} =7.6 K to 4.1000(5) A for YB_{5.9} with T_{c}=6.6 K. These values are in agreement with published data.[9] The possible influence of strains on T_{c} cannot be excluded: the high value T_{c}=8.4 K reported by Fisk _et al.[3]_ was obtained by splat-cooling of arc-melted samples with nominal composition YB_{6}. We tried to "anneal out" residual strains in different samples by a 36-h heat treatment at 1600 degC in 100 bars argon pressure, followed by slow cooling. The T_{c} onset of low-T_{c} samples (6.5 K) did not change; that of high-T_{c} samples (7.6 -7.8 K) decreased by about half a kelvin. In all cases the main effect was a broadening of the transition by 2-3 K. While such experiments tend to support the idea that strains increase T_{c}, the effect of losses during the heat treatment cannot be excluded.

The highest T_{c} is obtained for a B/Y ratio below 6. In this sense the reference crystal with T_{c}=7.2 K studied in the previous sections is not ideal because of the presence of boron vacancies. Therefore we briefly studied two other crystals with T_{c}^{onset}=6.5 K and 7.6 K. Their resistivity was only found to differ from that of the reference sample by the residual term, while the temperature-dependent part remained unchanged (Table 5). Magnetization curves were measured with increasing field and integrated to get the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) (Fig. 17, Table 5). Irreversibility may introduce some error by delaying the entry of vortices, leading to an overestimation of H_{c}(T). However, we found that the magnetic determination of H_{c}(T) was only 4% above that obtained from the specific heat for the reference sample, showing that the branch with increasing field is close to equilibrium. The net result is that T_{c} is positively correlated with H_{c}(0), \gamma_{n}, and therefore the EDOS, as is the case for most

From top to bottom: third critical field H_{c3}(T) defined by zero resistance for H parallel to the current and surface, second upper critical field H_{c2}(T) given by the position of the specific heat jump (closed diamonds) and the knee of the magnetization (open diamonds), thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) obtained by integration of the specific heat C/T (open circles), and lower critical field H_{c1}(T) given by the position of the sharp minimum of the magnetization (solid circles). All lines are polynomial fits to the data, except for the H_{c1}(T) line, which is recalculated based on H_{c}(T) and the Maki parameter \kappa_{1}(T) (see text). Inset: variation of \kappa_{1} with the temperature.

  BCS superconductors. The change in the EDOS is confirmed by the dc magnetic susceptibility. The curve for the sample with T_{c}=6.5 K is similar to that shown in Fig. 2 and described by the parameters \chi(0)=-16.8\times10^{-6}, a=4.0 \times10^{-11} K^{-2}, and C_{\rm Curie}=6.5\times10^{-4} K (see Sec. II). Compared to the reference sample, the susceptibility is more diamagnetic, which is attributed to a smaller Pauli contribution. The Curie term is equivalent to 120 ppm Yb^{3+}.

## IX IX. Conclusion

Specific heat, resistivity, and thermal expansion experiments performed on high quality single crystals have been used to characterize YB_{6}. This superconductor has a low density of states at the Fermi level. Some sample dependence of T_{c} can be traced to the variation of the B/Y ratio, which in turn influences the EDOS. The specific heat in the superconducting state is typical of a single-band, isotropic BCS superconductor; however, the electron-phonon interaction is much stronger than for the other superconducting borides, in particular ZrB_{12} and MgB_{2}. A common feature of these borides is nonuniform coupling to selected phonon modes. Whereas the strongly coupled modes lie at high energy \sim60 meV for MgB_{2},[52] they lie at low energy \sim15 meV for ZrB_{12} (Ref. [4]) and \sim8 meV for YB_{6}, which partly explains their relatively low T_{c}. Similarly to LaB_{6},[29] these low-frequency modes are associated with the vibration of Y or Zr atoms loosely bound in oversized boron cages. The reason for the lower characteristic frequency in YB_{6} compared to ZrB_{12} is neither to be found in the mass of the metal ions nor in the coordination number which is 24 in both cases. It is rather to be associated with the longer metal to boron bond, 3.03 A in YB_{6} (Ref. [53]) instead of 2.76 A in ZrB_{12} (Ref. [54]). This longer distance leads to a weaker force constant and larger vibrational amplitude, which in turn favors superconductivity. The thermal expansion indeed indicates that T_{c} will decrease with pressure and that these modes are strongly anharmonic. As for magnetic properties, YB_{6} is a type-II superconductor with \kappa\equiv 3 and clearly shows a third upper critical field at the surface, a rather rare occurrence.

Owing to the low characteristic energy of the phonons which mediate superconducting pairing, YB_{6} has been found to be an almost ideal system where, on the one hand, specific heat can substitute for inelastic neutron scattering (which is plagued by the absorption of ^{10}B) to study the PDOS and, on the other hand, resistivity can be substituted for tunnelling to study the electron-phonon coupling function. The spectral resolution of these procedures is limited and only makes sense on a logarithmic energy scale; nevertheless, this technique is found to be reproducible and able to give remarkably consistent values of \lambda_{ep} allowing significant comparisons to be made between borides.
