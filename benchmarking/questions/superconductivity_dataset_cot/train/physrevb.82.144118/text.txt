22 July 2010 x-ray diffraction data.[4] The high-pressure x-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the beamline 16-ID-D, HP-CAT, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. An angle dispersive technique with an image-plate area detector was employed using an x-ray wavelength l = 0.413 A. The high-pressure sample to image plate detector distance was set to 382.9 mm. In x-ray diffraction experiments, an internal copper pressure standard was employed for the calibration of pressure.[17] The Birch Murnaghan equation,[18] shown below, was fitted to the available equation of state data on the copper pressure standard.[17]

\[P = 3B_{0}f_{E}(1 + 2f_{E})^{5/2}\left\{ 1 + \frac{3}{2}(B^{\prime} - 4)f_{E} \right\}\]

where \(B_{o}\) is the bulk modulus, _B'_ is the first derivative of bulk modulus at ambient pressure, and \(V\)0 is the ambient pressure volume. The fitted values for copper pressure standard are \(B\)0 = 121.6 GPa, _B'_ = 5.583, and \(V\)0 = 11.815 A3/atom.

The parameter \(f_{E}\) is related to volume compression and is described below

\[f_{E} = \frac{\left[ \left( \frac{V_{o}}{V} \right)^{2/3} - 1 \right\rbrack}{2}.\]

Figure 1 shows the integrated x-ray diffraction profiles for BaFe2As2 obtained at various pressures from the image-plate diffraction studies using a wavelength l = 0.413 A. The image plate x-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with a focused x-ray beam of 5 _m_m x 8 _m_m on an 80 _m_m diameter BaFe2As2 sample mixed with copper pressure marker. The use of a focused x-ray beam allows us to collect high-quality x-ray diffraction patterns that are little affected by the inhomogeneous pressure conditions over the sample. We did not employ any pressure transmitting medium so the present studies can be regarded as nonhydrostatic where the uniaxial stress component is limited by the sample shear strength at high pressures. The geometrical constraints in our diamond-anvil cell device allowed x-ray diffraction data to be obtained to 2 _th_ below 26deg. Figure 1(a) shows the x-ray diffraction pattern at 0.1 GPa with the BaFe2As2 sample in the _I4/mmm_ phase and the copper pressure marker in the face-centered-cubic (fcc) phase. The diffraction peaks are labeled by their respective (hkl) values corresponding to crystallographic planes with Miller indices h, k, and l. The tetragonal phase of BaFe2As2 is characterized by the (101), (103), (110), (112), (200), (211), (204), (213), (220), and (323) diffraction peaks. The fcc phase of copper is characterized by the (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) diffraction peaks. The measured volume of copper by x-ray diffraction was used to calculate sample pressure from the equation of state given by Eq. (1). Our x-ray diffraction studies at ambient conditions showed a single phase sample of BaFe2As2 with lattice parameters consistent with \(a\) = 3.9635(5) A, \(c\) = 13.022(2) A, and axial ratio _c_/_a_ = 3.285.[5] The measured lattice parameters at 0.1 GPa are \(a\) = 3.961 +- 0.002 A and \(c\) = 13.004 +- 0.006 A, with _c_/_a_ = 3.283. Figure 1(b) shows the x-ray diffraction spectrum at a pressure of 16.4 GPa with lattice parameters \(a\) = 3.9842 +- 0.002 A and \(c\) = 10.595 +- 0.006 A. Comparing 16.4 GPa with 0.1 GPa data, the (112), (213), and (323) diffraction peaks shift to higher diffraction angles or lower interplanar spacing with increasing pressure while the (110) and (220) move to higher interplanar spacing [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)]. This is a clear evidence of the anomalous compression of the tetragonal lattice. This is in contrast to normal compression behavior which shows a uniform decrease in all dimensions of the unit cell. These observations agree very well with the previous high pressure studies of polycrystalline BaFe2As2 under quasihydrostatic condition in a helium pressure medium, where the \(a\) axis was found to increase with compression while the \(c\) axis decreased at T-CT structural transition and the CT phase in the \(I\)4/_mmm_ tetragonal structure was found to be stable up to 56 GPa at 300 K.[16] Another important point to note is that (213) and (220) diffraction peaks remain single peaks without any evidence of splitting and hence there is no evidence of a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transformation at high pressures, which is noted at low temperatures,[3, 4, 6] and also at ambient temperatures and high pressures.[10] Figure 1(c) shows that the phase remains tetragonal until the highest pressure of 35.4 GPa with lattice parameters \(a\) = 3.9149 +- 0.002 A and \(c\) = 9.809 +- 0.006 A. The compression of the tetragonal lattice between 16.4 and 35.4 GPa can be considered normal as all diffraction peaks move to higher angles or lower interplanar \(d\) spacings as can be seen by comparing Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). Also note that as pressure is increased beyond 16 GPa, the reflections such as (101), (112), (211), and (200) progressively decreases in intensity and the structure looks simpler. The decrease in intensity of tetragonal peaks such as (101) and the simplicity of high-pressure phase could mean that the body centering and hence the \(I\)4/_mmm_ symmetry may not exist anymore. However, apart from the reflections from the fcc phase of copper, all the other observed Bragg peaks were clearly indexed with \(I\)4/_mmm_ tetragonal structure up to the highest static pressure of 35 GPa. Our attempts to fit the highest pressure phase with other possible structure such as hexagonal NiAs phase

  did not provide any satisfactory fits. The decrease in intensity of (hkl) with nonzero \(l\) values can be explained by pressure-induced texturing effect where the \(c\) axis of the grains tends to orient along the load axis of the diamond-anvil cell.

To elucidate the preferred orientation effects, we have performed Rietveld refinements of an x-diffraction pattern from the sample at 18.7 GPa, just after the T-CT phase transition (Fig. 2). This provides further evidence that the observed change in intensity at higher pressures can be explained by the preferred orientation in the sample and is not due to any structural phase transition. The difference between the observed x-ray diffraction pattern and Rietveld refined spectrum is reasonable considering a simple orientation model where \(c\) axis is aligned along the load axis of the diamond-anvil cell (Fig. 2). The Rietveld refinements were performed using gsas Rietveld package with a March-Dollase preferred orientation along the (110) plane.[19] The refinement treated the (110) plane as a preferred orientation. If there were no preferred orientation then all refraction planes would be represented with the same weight of 1.00. The refinement gave (110) plane a weight of 0.26, this would demonstrate a definite preferred orientation for the system.

Figure 3 shows the measured lattice parameters \(a\) and \(c\) as a function of pressure exhibiting anomalous compression effects. Below 5.2 GPa, both \(a\) and \(c\) lattice parameters shrink with increasing pressure. Then the structure follows abnormal behavior whereby \(a\) increases with increasing pressure with a peak at a pressure of 16.4 GPa. A further increase in pressure beyond 16.4 GPa, results in a decrease in \(a\) axis and a normal compression behavior that continues until the highest pressure of 35 GPa. This negative compressibility of \(a\) axis is a very intriguing feature of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) compression. The \(c\) lattice parameter shows a rapid decrease with increasing pressure between 9 and 16 GPa, and a normal decrease with further increase in pressure to 35 GPa. These observations show that continuous second-order phase transition starts between ~5 and ~9 GPa. At ~16.4 GPa, BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) completely transforms to a high-pressure collapse tetragonal structure within the same space group but with a larger \(a\) and smaller \(c\) lattice parameters. The observed changes of \(a\) axis and \(c\) axis of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) between 5 and 16 GPa and normalized to values at 16 GPa are -15.5% for \(c\) axis, +2.5% for \(a\) axis, -11.1% for volume and -17.6% for _c_/_a_. These changes are extremely anisotropic and are similar to those of LaFe\({}_{2}\)P\({}_{2}\) between 4 and 9 GPa and EuFe\({}_{2}\)P\({}_{2}\) between 2 and 9 GPa.[11]

Figure 4 shows the measured axial ratio (_c_/_a_) as a function of pressure to 35 GPa at ambient temperature. The axial ratio (_c_/_a_) shows a rapid decrease with increasing pressure till 16 GPa and a gradual decrease above this pressure. In fact, the _c_/_a_ ratio variation as a function of pressure can be divided into two linear regions and the fits for the two linear regions are shown in Fig. 3 and described below

\[c/a=3.510-0.054P,\quad 5\leq P\leq 16\ \ \text{GPa},\] (3)

\[c/a=2.692-0.005P,\quad 18\leq P\leq 35\ \ \text{GPa}.\] (4)

The intersection of the two linear regions as described by Eqs. (3) and (4) defines the phase transition from the ambient

Figure 4: The measured axial ratio (_c_/_a_) for the tetragonal phase of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) as a function of pressure to 35 GPa. The linear fits for the two phases, i.e., the T phase and the CT phase are described in the text. The transition between the two phases occurs at 16.7 GPa at ambient temperature.

Figure 3: The measured \(a\) and \(c\) lattice parameters for the tetragonal phase of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) as a function of pressure. A negative compressibility is observed for the \(a\) axis and a maximum is observed at 16.4 GPa. The \(c\) axis shows a rapid decrease with increasing pressure till 16.4 GPa and a normal decrease with further increase in pressure. The error bars for \(c\) are less than the symbol size.

  pressure T phase to the so-called CT phase. This phase transition is defined by the present experiments to occur near 16.7 GPa at ambient temperature. A further x-ray diffraction study at low temperature would be needed to follow this phase boundary to low temperatures.

Figure 5 shows the measured pressure-volume (P-V) curve or equation of state for BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) to 35 GPa at ambient temperature. Also shown are the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fits as described by Eq. (1). The fit parameters for the tetragonal and collapsed tetragonal phases are summarized in Table 1. The fitted ambient pressure volume (V0) is 205.0 A\({}^{3}\) for the T phase and 190.4 A\({}^{3}\) for the CT phase, indicating that a hypothetical CT phase at ambient pressure has a density that is 7.1% higher than the T phase (Table 1). The measured equation of state shows considerable stiffening at the tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal phase transition as evidenced by the change in slope of the volume-pressure curve at 16.7 GPa as shown in Fig. 5. The fitted value of Bulk Modulus \(B_{0}\)=57.7 GPa for the T phase and \(B_{0}\)=104.4 GPa for the CT phase at ambient pressure. This comparison shows that the T phase of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is more compressible than a hypothetical CT phase at ambient pressure by a factor of 1.8. The dashed curve in Fig. 5 shows a single Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fit for the entire low- and high-pressure P-V data combined. The single fit deviates quite significantly from the measured P-V data in comparison to the two fit obtained when high- and low-pressure regions are fitted separately. The single-fit parameters are also included in Table 1 for comparison purposes.

The superconducting transition (\(T_{C}\)) measurements have been carried out using four probe electrical resistance measurements in a designer diamond anvil as described in an earlier publication.[20] In this study, no pressure medium was used and hence the reported superconducting transition temperatures correspond to a nonhydrostatic case. The continuous phase transition observed in BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) may be closely related to the behavior of \(T_{C}\) observed experimentally under different pressures. Figure 6 shows the electrical resistance as a function of temperature at a pressure of 5.5 GPa indicating onset of superconductivity at 28.4 K. Figure 7 shows the measured onset of \(T_{C}\) as a function of pressure up to 30 GPa and down to 10 K. \(T_{C}\) increases to a maximum temperature of 34 K at a pressure of 1.0 GPa and then decreases monotonically with increase in pressure from 1.0 to 8.3 GPa. The pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature for single crystalline BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) shown in Fig. 7 under nonhydrostatic conditions is also compared to the data reported by Mani _et al.[21]_ to a maximum pressure of 7 GPa in a solid steatite pressure-transmitting medium and a good agreement is obtained. Figure 7 shows that \(T_{C}\) variation as a function of P can be described by a second-order polynomial equation shown below

\[T_{C}(\text{K})=(34.93\pm 0.71)-(0.99\pm 0.32)P-(0.06\pm 0.03)P^{2},\]

\[1.0\leq P\leq 8.3\text{ GPa}.\] (5)

The solid line is the polynomial fit to experimental \(T_{C}\) (P) data in Fig. 7 and it suggests that \(T_{C}\) decreases rapidly in the region where anomalous compressibility effects are observed in the \(a\) axis. The extrapolation of the second order polynomial fit described above suggests that \(T_{C}\) approaches 0 K at 17 GPa and a nonsuperconducting state is achieved above

\begin{table}

It is interesting to note that our measured structural x-ray diffraction data also shows a transition from tetragonal to a collapsed tetragonal phase at around 17 GPa at 300 K. Previous powder synchrotron diffraction experiment on polycrystalline sample shows that this transition occurs at 22 GPa at 300 K and 26 GPa at 33 K using a helium pressure medium.[16] The phase transition from tetragonal to collapsed tetragonal phase seems to be sensitive to the magnitude of uniaxial stresses that may explain the scatter in transition pressure from 17 to 22 GPa at ambient temperature. The region between vertical lines at 17 and 26 GPa, therefore, represent the pressure range over which this structural transition would seem likely to occur at low temperatures. The \(T_{C}\) values for higher pressures could not be determined because the lowest temperature possible using our experimental set up in this study is only 10 K and graphical points with down-pointing arrows in Fig. 7 indicates that onset of \(T_{C}\) is suppressed to below this temperature limit of 10 K in the pressure region where T-CT phase transition occur. Additional low-temperature experiments below 10 K are needed to precisely pinpoint the disappearance of superconductivity and correlate it to stability of the CT phase. In contrast, this observation differ from that reported in EuFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (Ref. [15]) in which superconducting transition temperature was observed to be enhanced in the region where anomalous compression is robust, reaching a maximum around T-CT phase transition region. However, europium 122 compounds have a pressure induced valence transition from Eu\({}^{2+}\) to Eu\({}^{3+}\) in the pressure range of anomalous compression that needs to be accounted for in making comparison with alkaline-earth metal compounds.

In conclusion, we have carried out a superconductivity study under high pressure using four probe electrical resistance measurements, with designer diamond anvils up to 30 GPa and down to 10 K, and high pressure powder x-ray diffractions measurements of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) to 35 GPa at ambient temperature using a synchrotron source. The image plate x-ray diffraction studies reveal an anomalous compression effect of the \(a\) axis and a structural phase transition from the normal T phase to the CT at 16.7 GPa and ambient temperature. The equation of state for the T phase and CT phase show distinct bulk moduli and pressure derivatives of Bulk Moduli. At ambient pressure, an extrapolated CT phase has a density that is 7.1% higher as compared to the T phase under similar conditions. The superconducting transition (\(T_{C}\)) is marked by a decrease in electrical resistance as a function of temperature. The measured value of \(T_{C}\) shows a second order polynomial decrease from a maximum of 34 K at 1.0 GPa down to 23 K at 8.3 GPa and is extrapolated to 0K at 17 GPa, which is the same pressure region where the sample changes from normal tetragonal phase to collapsed tetragonal phase. Our high-pressure studies have shown anomalous compressibility effects, the presence of a possible collapsed tetragonal phase, and superconducting properties that are correlated with its compression behavior. We suggest that the anomalous compressibility effect observed in the lattice parameter for BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) under pressure may be a common effect among the 122 compounds of the type \(A\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(A\) = divalent alkaline-earth or rare-earth metal) having the ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\)-type crystal structure and may be related to observed superconductivity in BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). Additional systematic theoretical and experimental studies of structural phase transitions and superconductivity in BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) under hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic pressure conditions and lower temperatures are required to clearly establish a correlation between transition pressure, superconductivity, and crystal structure.

Figure 7: The measured superconducting transition temperature as a function of pressure for BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) as obtained by electrical resistivity measurements using a diamond anvil cell. \(T_{C}\) increases to a maximum temperature of 34 K at a pressure of 1.0 GPa and then decreases monotonically with decrease in pressure between 1.0 and 8.3 GPa. The \(T_{C}\) below 10 K could not be determined because the lowest temperature limit in this study is 10 K and graphical points with down-arrow indicate that \(T_{C}\) is likely to be below this temperature. The solid curve shows a second-order polynomial fit to data and it is described in the text. The region between the vertical lines at 17 and 26 GPa represent the pressure range over which T-CT transition would seem likely to occur at low temperatures. Our data is in excellent agreement with an earlier study of Mani _et al._ (Ref. [21]) to 7 GPa.
