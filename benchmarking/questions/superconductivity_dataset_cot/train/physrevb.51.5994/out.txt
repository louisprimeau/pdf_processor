###### Abstract

Magnetic susceptibility measurements for Sr2CuO3+-8 were made from 2 to 800 K, and a strong dependence upon oxygen content (8) was observed. Samples synthesized under oxygen, followed by various nitrogen treatments, exhibited markedly different Curie-Weiss-type terms, and we discuss possible origins for this behavior. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements for the sample with the smallest Curie-Weiss-type term clearly show the increase with temperature expected from the Bonner-Fisher model for a spin-\frac{1}{2} one-dimensional (1D) Heisenberg antiferromagnet. This is a direct experimental observation of 1D magnetic behavior in this system. The in-chain superexchange coupling constant, as determined by a fit to the Bonner-Fisher model, is |J|/k_{B} = 1300^{+100}_{-200} K, comparable to the values observed in the two-dimensional layered cuprates. Estimates of the interchain magnetic interaction indicate this material may be the best realization of a 1D spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnet reported to date. Low-temperature neutron and synchrotron x-ray powder-diffraction studies of Sr2CuO3 show that the low-temperature structure of this system has Immm space-group symmetry, the same structure reported at room temperature, indicating that this material, in contrast to La2CuO4 does not undergo any structural transformations upon cooling. The absence of crystallographic distortions precludes a magnetic anisotropy contribution from a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, implying that Sr2CuO3 should be a nearly ideal spin-\frac{1}{2} antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain compound, in agreement with the magnetic susceptibility results. A search for the presence of long-range three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order by magnetic neutron powder diffraction at temperatures as low as 1.5 K was not successful, although we estimate an upper limit for the size of the ordered moment which could have been detected to be \sim 0.1\mu_{B} per Cu^{2+} ion.

## Introduction

Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, many studies have been performed both to search for new superconductors and elucidate the mechanism underlying the high transition temperatures (T_{c} ). At this time, all known systems with T_{c} > 40 K possess two-dimensional CuO2 sheets, which are generally agreed to play the active role in superconductivity. On the other hand, it has recently been reported1 that Sr2CuO3+-8 exhibits high-temperature superconductivity for appropriate values of 8. The parent insulating phase for these superconductors, Sr2CuO3, has a crystal structure2 in which one-dimensional Cu-O chains, similar to those in YBa2Cu3O7, lie parallel to the a axis (Fig. 1). Although no one has reported superconductivity in materials that only have Cu-O one-dimensional chains, the observation of superconductivity in these materials raises important questions concerning the minimum magnetic and electronic dimensionalities, which will support high T_{c}. Furthermore, since the insulating parents of all other known high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors are two-dimensional spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnets,3 it is important to understand the magnetism in this one-dimensional system as a prerequisite to determining its evolution as the system is doped into the metallic and superconducting state. Toward that end, we have studied the static magnetic properties of this material, and we observe direct evidence of Bonner-Fisher-type behavior,4 indicating that Sr2CuO3 is a nearly ideal one-dimensional (1D) spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

We expect that the decomposition temperature of Sr2CuO3 would decrease below 900degC if the oxygen partial pressure were further reduced and, in fact, samples heated above about 520degC in 6-Torr He do decompose. The oxygen contents of the samples were determined iodometrically.

Powder x-ray-diffraction data for initial characterization were obtained with a Scintag diffractometer using Cu_K_a_ radiation at ambient temperature. Magnetic susceptibilities below 300 K were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design), whereas the high-temperature susceptibility (to 800 K) was measured using an Oxford Instruments Faraday balance. The contribution of ferromagnetic impurities to the measured magnetization was determined from magnetization-field isotherms between 25 and 750 K and was found to correspond to that of 2 at. ppm or less, with respect to Cu, of ferromagnetic iron metal impurities; this contribution is corrected for in Fig. 3 below. The magnetic measurements from the SQUID and the Faraday magnetometers were in good agreement below 300 K.

Low-temperature neutron powder-diffraction studies were carried out at 11 K using the BT-4 triple-axis spectrometer at the reactor facility of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The collimation was 20'-40'-10', and the neutron wavelength (1.540 A) was chosen by a Cu (220) monochromator. The sample was mounted in an Al sample container containing He exchange gas. Low-temperature synchrotron x-ray powder-diffraction5 data were collected at 12 K at beamline X-7A at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

## Results

### Magnetic susceptibility

There have been several previous studies6-8 of the magnetic susceptibility of Sr2CuO3, but none of these studies observed clear evidence for Bonner-Fisher4 behavior, and therefore accurate values of J, the Cu2+-Cu2+ nearest-neighbor superexchange coupling constant, were not determined. Furthermore, no systematic attempt was made in these earlier studies to account for the possible effect of oxygen nonstoichiometry on the magnetic susceptibilities. To address these problems, we have made magnetic susceptibility measurements over a wide range of temperatures on samples that have undergone various annealing treatments and therefore have slightly different oxygen contents (Table 1). The susceptibility is strongly affected by such treatments. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependencies below 300 K of the magnetic susceptibilities of samples before and after annealing under a N2 or a 6-Torr He atmosphere. The diamagnetic terms originating in the closed shells of the ions have been subtracted. (\chi_{\rm dia} = - 77 \times 10^{- 6} cm3/mole). Plot (a) shows the susceptibility for an as-made sample before nitrogen treatment. As can be seen from this figure, treatment under a reducing atmosphere decreases the susceptibility, especially the Curie-type component. Thus it is natural to associate the magnitude of this Curie-type term with the presence of excess oxygen in the lattice. (This point will be discussed further below.) In this picture, the as-made sample (a) contains some excess oxygen-ion defects, whereas nitrogen annealing reduces the number of such defects and consequently suppresses the Curie-Weiss-like behavior at low temperatures. Furthermore, Fig. 2 shows the susceptibility for a sample that was kept at 600 K under 6-Torr He overnight and then measured _without_ being removed from the He atmosphere. This sample shows a much smaller Curie-Weiss-type term compared with the other samples, presumably due to loss of almost all the excess oxygen after the overnight anneal. Since samples annealed in N2, but then exposed to air before the magnetic measurements were

  made, have larger Curie-Weiss-type terms, we suggest that this material absorbs oxygen from air at room temperature fairly quickly, and that considerable care must be taken if one wishes to measure properties for the stoichiometric system.

Figure 3 shows the susceptibility versus temperature from 10 to 800 K for the sample annealed at 327degC (600 K) under 6-Torr He and then measured in the same atmosphere. Between 25 and 750 K the susceptibility was found to be independent of applied magnetic field H up to H = 7.0 T (after correction for the influence of ferromagnetic impurities; see above). The enhancement of the susceptibility at low temperature presumably originates from a residual Curie-Weiss-like component, as mentioned above, but the gradual increase of the susceptibility with increasing temperature in the high-temperature region is not Curie-Weiss-like, but rather is similar to a Bonner-Fisher-type susceptibility,[4] as our fit to the data described below demonstrates.

### Synchrotron- and neutron-diffraction studies

The crystal structure of Sr2CuO3 at room temperature was first determined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction.[2] Powder neutron[9] and x-ray-diffraction[10] data at room temperature have also been reported. All of these studies assigned the orthorhombic _Immm_ space group to Sr2CuO3. We utilized neutron and synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction at low temperatures in order to search for any evidence of structural phase transitions or distortions, which would further lower the symmetry and, for example, contribute to the magnetic anisotropy by allowing a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction[11] to occur. It is known that the leading-order magnetic anisotropy in several of the cuprates, for example, La2CuO4, arises from the DM interaction.

Structural information determined by Rietveld refinement[12] of neutron-diffraction data (Fig. 4) obtained at 11 K are shown in Table 2. Aluminum reflections from the sample container used were excluded from the refinement. No superlattice peaks, which would indicate lattice distortion, were observed. High-resolution synchrotron x-ray-diffraction data (Fig. 5) at 12 K yielded a similar conclusion. These results show that there are no structural transformations in Sr2CuO3 between room temperature and 11 - 12 K.

We also note that recent muon spin rotation data[8] have been interpreted as offering evidence for three-dimensional magnetic ordering in Sr2CuO3 (synthesized in air) with a Neel temperature of 5 K. Since we observed no magnetic neutron powder diffraction at 1.5 K for a similar sample prepared in air, we conclude either that the Neel temperatures are different for these two samples, that only short-range magnetic ordering occurs, or that the ordered moment is simply too small to be observed by neutron powder diffraction. In fact, we have estimated an upper limit for the magnitude of the Cu2+ magnetic moment, which would have been observable in our neutron-diffraction measurements, if these moments exhibited long-range 3D antiferromagnetic order characterized by an antiferromagnetic propagation vector and spin direction similar to those observed for other

  K_{2}NiF_{4}-type oxides such as La_{2}CuO_{4} (Ref. 13), La_{2}NiO_{4} (Ref. 14), or Ca_{2}MnO_{4} (Ref. 15). For example, if the antiferromagnetic ordering was such that the (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},1) were an allowed magnetic Bragg reflection, then an ordered moment \geq 0.1\mu_{B} would have yielded an observable peak intensity. The same is approximately true for other magnetic peaks with (_hkl_) values corresponding to 0.7 A^{-1}\leq Q\leq2.0 A^{-1}. Thus, our sample either did not exhibit long-range magnetic order, or the size of the ordered moment is less than 0.1\mu_{B}. The latter situation could arise due to strong renormalization of the ordered moment as a result of quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations are generally more important in 1D than in 2D magnetic systems and are particularly large for spin-\frac{1}{2} ions such as Cu^{2+}. Table 3 lists classical and observed values for the ordered moments for several 1D antiferromagnets,^{16-17} clearly demonstrating the moment re-normalization due to quantum fluctuations. It is also obvious from these data that the effect of fluctuations indeed grows as the value of the spin decreases, and might therefore be expected to reduce the ordered moment by more than a factor of 2 in a spin-\frac{1}{2} material such as Sr_{2}CuO_{3}. Experimental resolution of this issue must

## Discussion

The magnetic Hamiltonian, which describes a spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg chain,

\[H = 2|J|\sum\limits_{i}{\bf S}_{i} \cdot {\bf S}_{i + 1}\ ,\]

was described previously.4 In this expression, J is the Cu^{2+}-Cu^{2+} intrachain superexchange coupling constant, and the summation extends over pairs of nearest-neighbor spins. It is worthwhile spending a moment to justify the use of such a model to describe the magnetic susceptibility of Sr2CuO3. The assumption that Sr2CuO3 is a one-dimensional magnetic system follows directly from the structure of this material (Fig. 1). Since the Cu^{2+} ions are only bonded to oxygen ions along the a direction with 180^{\circ} Cu--O--Cu bonds, there will be strong Cu^{2+}-Cu^{2+} antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions only in this direction. The additional assumption that this is a Heisenberg system is based upon the fact that the Cu^{2+} ion is spin \frac{1}{2} and thus has no single-ion anisotropy to first order. Furthermore, the structural studies reported here and previously[9, 10] for Sr2CuO3 demonstrate that there is an inversion center located midway between the Cu^{2+} ions in the Cu-O chains, which precludes the existence of a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) {\bf S}_{i} \times {\bf S}_{j} interaction.[11] In contrast, La2CuO4, an antiferromagnetic insulator, which is structurally similar to Sr2CuO3, has a leading-order magnetic anisotropy arising from a DM interaction, which is allowed by the rotational distortion of the CuO6 octahedra in the Bmab (orthorhombic) phase.[18] We also expect that the interchain magnetic coupling will be rather weak in this material, partly as a result of magnetic frustration. For example, the _interlayer_ interchain superexchange in Sr2CuO3 is fully frustrated _despite_ the orthorhombic symmetry, again in contrast to the situation in orthorhombic La2CuO4, where the _interlayer_ superexchange is not frustrated. This is true because, considering a given Cu^{2+} ion, the four nearest-neighbor Cu^{2+} ions in the nearest-neighbor chains in adjacent layers are _equidistant_ in Sr2CuO3, whereas in La2CuO4 there are _two_ such distances. The _intralayer_ interchain interaction is, on the other hand, not frustrated, but is still expected to be rather weak due to the absence of intervening oxygen ions between adjacent Cu^{2+} ions. Thus, in general, one expects Sr2CuO3 to be more Heisenberg-like than La2CuO4, the latter nevertheless being considered one of the best examples of a spin-\frac{1}{2} 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnet.[19] Therefore, we should expect Sr2CuO3 to be an excellent realization of a 1D Heisenberg antiferromagnet, and it seems very reasonable to attempt to describe its magnetic susceptibility with the Bonner-Fisher model for a spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain.

In order to fit the susceptibility data shown in Fig. 3 over a wide temperature range, we assume that the observed temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, \chi(T), consists of three terms:

\[\chi(T) = \chi_{\rm dia} + \chi_{PV} + \chi_{\rm spin}(T)\ ,\]

where \chi_{\rm dia} is due to the diamagnetism of the core electron shells, \chi_{PV} is the Van Vleck paramagnetism of the open shells of the Cu^{2+} ions, and \chi_{\rm spin}(T) is the Cu^{2+} spin susceptibility. In the absence of appreciable numbers of conduction electrons, the Pauli paramagnetism and the Landau diamagnetism should be negligible. \chi_{\rm dia} and \chi_{PV} are assumed to be temperature independent, and the values of \chi_{\rm dia} used were found in Ref. [20]. Furthermore, the spin susceptibility was separated into two parts:

\[\chi_{\rm spin}(T) = \rho(\chi_{\rm CW}) + (1 - \rho)\chi_{\rm BF}\]

where \chi_{\rm CW} is a Curie-Weiss-like component arising from finite length chains, which consist of an odd number of Cu^{2+} spins,[4] isolated Cu^{2+} spins, and/or other paramagnetic impurities, and \chi_{\rm BF} is the susceptibility of an S = \frac{1}{2} infinite isotropic Heisenberg chain (the Bonner-Fisher susceptibility[4, 21]). The coefficient \rho represents the defect and/or impurity level. There are no analytical solutions for the magnetic susceptibility of Heisenberg chains.[4] However, a useful closed-form approximation to \chi_{\rm BF} has been suggested[22] to be

\[\chi_{\rm BF} = \frac{Ng^{2}\mu_{B}^{2}S(S + 1)}{k_{B}T}\,\left[ \frac{0.25 + 0.14995x+0.30094x^{2}}{1 + 1.9862x+0.68854x^{2} + 6.0626x^{3}}\right]\]

with x = |J|/k_{B}T. The Curie-Weiss-like term is

\[\chi_{\rm CW} = \frac{Ng^{2}\mu_{B}^{2}S(S + 1)}{3k_{B}(T - \theta)}\ .\]

Assuming that g = 2.1, a typical value for cuprates,[3, 23] and S = \frac{1}{2}, we determine the following parameters by fitting Eq. (2) to the magnetic susceptibility data in Fig. 3 after subtracting the core diamagnetism:

\[\rho = 1.14 \times 10^{- 3}\ ({\rm i.\ e.\ ,\ impurity\ level} = 0.11\%)\ ,\] \[\theta = - 7.81\ {\rm K}\ ,\] \[|J|/k_{B} = 1307\ {\rm K}\ ,\] \[\chi_{PV} = 2.28 \times 10^{- 5}\ {\rm cm}^{3}/{\rm mole}\ .\]

The value of \chi_{PV} is comparable to that of other single Cu-O layer cuprates.[24] The fit using these parameter values is shown superimposed on the data in Fig. 3. The fit function has been extended to temperatures high enough to include the broad peak in the susceptibility arising from the appearance of short-range 1D order with decreasing temperature. Furthermore, several curves calculated assuming different values of J are plotted to give a sense of the sensitivity of the fit to this important parameter. From these curves we estimate the value of |J|/k_{B} to be 1300^{+ 100}_{- 200} K.

As mentioned previously, a Curie-Weiss-type term can originate from several possible sources, including nearly isolated Cu^{2+} ions associated with oxygen defects (oxy  gen vacancies or excess oxygen), some other kind of lattice defect, or magnetic impurities. However, an equally plausible explanation is that the Curie-like behavior originates from Cu-O 1D chains, which are randomly terminated by oxygen defects. As Bonner and Fisher have discussed,4 if the resulting chains have an even number of Cu2+ spins, then the total spin on the chain in the antiferromagnetically ordered state is zero at T = 0. If, however, the chains have an odd number of Cu2+ spins, then in the antiferromagnetically ordered state the net spin on the chain is \frac{1}{2}. Such chains of odd length will make contributions to the magnetic susceptibility, which are Curie-Weiss-like, although both the amplitude of the susceptibility divergence and the temperature at which the divergence occurs are depressed with increasing chain length by Cu2+-Cu2+ antiferromagnetic interactions. In the opposite limit, "chains" that have a length of only one Cu2+ will precisely exhibit Curie-Weiss behavior. To avoid the additional complications necessary to model contributions to the magnetic susceptibility arising from chains with a random distribution of lengths, we have chosen to represent the spin susceptibility for Sr2CuO3 simply as a Curie-Weiss term plus a Bonner-Fisher term. We thus assume that the inclusion of a Curie-Weiss term will adequately represent the contributions from odd length finite chains, as well as additional contributions due to isolated Cu2+ ions and/or impurities. This simplification minimizes the number of refinement parameters, and the quality of the fit indicates it to be a reasonable approximation.

The results of these measurements thus indicate that Sr2CuO3 is an excellent realization of a 1D spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnet. In fact, it may be the best realization of such a system reported to date. In order to place Sr2CuO3 in the context of other 1D antiferromagnets, Table IV shows parameters for several such systems, which have appeared in the literature.17J_{1} and J_{2} are the two interchain magnetic coupling constants in orthogonal directions (in the b and c directions in Sr2CuO3). For all materials[16, 17, 25, 26] other than Sr2CuO3 in Table IV we have assumed that J_{1} = J_{2}. We have also calculated independent values of J_{1} and J_{2} for Sr2CuO3, assuming only dipolar interchain coupling, using the expression

\[J_{\alpha} = - \sum_{i}\frac{\mu \cdot \mu_{i}(3\cos^{2}\phi_{i} - 1)}{r_{i}^{3}}\]

, where the sum is over the Cu moments \mu_{i} in the same (J_{\alpha} = J_{1}) or different (J_{\alpha} = J_{2}) layers, \tau_{i} is the vector from the moment \mu to the moment \mu_{i}, and \phi_{i} is the angle between \tau_{i} and the a axis. For this calculation the magnetic structure was assumed to be the same as that reported for Sr2CuO2Cl2 (Ref. 27): in our case we assume the Cn2+ spins to be either parallel or antiparallel to the a axis. The summation in Eq. (6) included Cu2+ moments within a distance r_{i} sufficient to achieve convergence.

Values of J_{1} (= J_{2}) in Table IV were calculated from the following expressions28-30 using experimental values[8, 17] of T_{N} and J:

\[\frac{kT_{N}}{|J|} = \frac{4S(S + 1)/3}{I(\eta_{1},\eta_{2})}\]

, where \eta_{1} = J_{1}/J, \eta_{2} = J_{2}/J, and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c}  & T_{N} (K) & J (K) & S (spin) & I (\eta_{1},\eta_{2}) & \eta_{1} & \eta_{2} & J_{1} (K) & J_{2} (K) \\ Sr2CuO3 & 0.028a & 1307 & 1/2 & 4.7 × 104 & 2.8 × 10−5 & 5.1 × 10−7 & 0.036  \[I(\eta_{1},\eta_{2}) = \frac{1}{\pi^{3}}\int\int\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{dq_{x}dq_{y}dq_{z}}{\eta_{1}(1-\cos\!{q_{x}})+\eta_{2}(1-\cos\!{q_{y}})+(1-\cos\!{q_{z}})}\enspace.\]

For the case, where _J_/_J_ > 1, and J 1/_J_ 2 > 1, Eq. (8) can be approximated by [30]

\[I(\eta_{1},\eta_{2}) = \frac{0.64}{\sqrt{\eta_{1}}}\left[1+0.253\ln\left[\frac{\eta_{1}}{\eta_{2}

###### Abstract

Magnetic susceptibility measurements for Sr2CuO3+-8 were made from 2 to 800 K, and a strong dependence upon oxygen content (8) was observed. Samples synthesized under oxygen, followed by various nitrogen treatments, exhibited markedly different Curie-Weiss-type terms, and we discuss possible origins for this behavior. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements for the sample with the smallest Curie-Weiss-type term clearly show the increase with temperature expected from the Bonner-Fisher model for a spin-\frac{1}{2} one-dimensional (1D) Heisenberg antiferromagnet. This is a direct experimental observation of 1D magnetic behavior in this system. The in-chain superexchange coupling constant, as determined by a fit to the Bonner-Fisher model, is |J|/k_{B} = 1300^{+100}_{-200} K, comparable to the values observed in the two-dimensional layered cuprates. Estimates of the interchain magnetic interaction indicate this material may be the best realization of a 1D spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnet reported to date. Low-temperature neutron and synchrotron x-ray powder-diffraction studies of Sr2CuO3 show that the low-temperature structure of this system has Immm space-group symmetry, the same structure reported at room temperature, indicating that this material, in contrast to La2CuO4 does not undergo any structural transformations upon cooling. The absence of crystallographic distortions precludes a magnetic anisotropy contribution from a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, implying that Sr2CuO3 should be a nearly ideal spin-\frac{1}{2} antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain compound, in agreement with the magnetic susceptibility results. A search for the presence of long-range three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order by magnetic neutron powder diffraction at temperatures as low as 1.5 K was not successful, although we estimate an upper limit for the size of the ordered moment which could have been detected to be \sim 0.1\mu_{B} per Cu^{2+} ion.

## Introduction

Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, many studies have been performed both to search for new superconductors and elucidate the mechanism underlying the high transition temperatures (T_{c} ). At this time, all known systems with T_{c} > 40 K possess two-dimensional CuO2 sheets, which are generally agreed to play the active role in superconductivity. On the other hand, it has recently been reported1 that Sr2CuO3+-8 exhibits high-temperature superconductivity for appropriate values of 8. The parent insulating phase for these superconductors, Sr2CuO3, has a crystal structure2 in which one-dimensional Cu-O chains, similar to those in YBa2Cu3O7, lie parallel to the a axis (Fig. 1). Although no one has reported superconductivity in materials that only have Cu-O one-dimensional chains, the observation of superconductivity in these materials raises important questions concerning the minimum magnetic and electronic dimensionalities, which will support high T_{c}. Furthermore, since the insulating parents of all other known high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors are two-dimensional spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnets,3 it is important to understand the magnetism in this one-dimensional system as a prerequisite to determining its evolution as the system is doped into the metallic and superconducting state. Toward that end, we have studied the static magnetic properties of this material, and we observe direct evidence of Bonner-Fisher-type behavior,4 indicating that Sr2CuO3 is a nearly ideal one-dimensional (1D) spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

We expect that the decomposition temperature of Sr2CuO3 would decrease below 900degC if the oxygen partial pressure were further reduced and, in fact, samples heated above about 520degC in 6-Torr He do decompose. The oxygen contents of the samples were determined iodometrically.

Powder x-ray-diffraction data for initial characterization were obtained with a Scintag diffractometer using Cu_K_a_ radiation at ambient temperature. Magnetic susceptibilities below 300 K were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design), whereas the high-temperature susceptibility (to 800 K) was measured using an Oxford Instruments Faraday balance. The contribution of ferromagnetic impurities to the measured magnetization was determined from magnetization-field isotherms between 25 and 750 K and was found to correspond to that of 2 at. ppm or less, with respect to Cu, of ferromagnetic iron metal impurities; this contribution is corrected for in Fig. 3 below. The magnetic measurements from the SQUID and the Faraday magnetometers were in good agreement below 300 K.

Low-temperature neutron powder-diffraction studies were carried out at 11 K using the BT-4 triple-axis spectrometer at the reactor facility of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The collimation was 20'-40'-10', and the neutron wavelength (1.540 A) was chosen by a Cu (220) monochromator. The sample was mounted in an Al sample container containing He exchange gas. Low-temperature synchrotron x-ray powder-diffraction5 data were collected at 12 K at beamline X-7A at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

## Results

### Magnetic susceptibility

There have been several previous studies6-8 of the magnetic susceptibility of Sr2CuO3, but none of these studies observed clear evidence for Bonner-Fisher4 behavior, and therefore accurate values of J, the Cu2+-Cu2+ nearest-neighbor superexchange coupling constant, were not determined. Furthermore, no systematic attempt was made in these earlier studies to account for the possible effect of oxygen nonstoichiometry on the magnetic susceptibilities. To address these problems, we have made magnetic susceptibility measurements over a wide range of temperatures on samples that have undergone various annealing treatments and therefore have slightly different oxygen contents (Table 1). The susceptibility is strongly affected by such treatments. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependencies below 300 K of the magnetic susceptibilities of samples before and after annealing under a N2 or a 6-Torr He atmosphere. The diamagnetic terms originating in the closed shells of the ions have been subtracted. (\chi_{\rm dia} = - 77 \times 10^{- 6} cm3/mole). Plot (a) shows the susceptibility for an as-made sample before nitrogen treatment. As can be seen from this figure, treatment under a reducing atmosphere decreases the susceptibility, especially the Curie-type component. Thus it is natural to associate the magnitude of this Curie-type term with the presence of excess oxygen in the lattice. (This point will be discussed further below.) In this picture, the as-made sample (a) contains some excess oxygen-ion defects, whereas nitrogen annealing reduces the number of such defects and consequently suppresses the Curie-Weiss-like behavior at low temperatures. Furthermore, Fig. 2 shows the susceptibility for a sample that was kept at 600 K under 6-Torr He overnight and then measured _without_ being removed from the He atmosphere. This sample shows a much smaller Curie-Weiss-type term compared with the other samples, presumably due to loss of almost all the excess oxygen after the overnight anneal. Since samples annealed in N2, but then exposed to air before the magnetic measurements were

  made, have larger Curie-Weiss-type terms, we suggest that this material absorbs oxygen from air at room temperature fairly quickly, and that considerable care must be taken if one wishes to measure properties for the stoichiometric system.

Figure 3 shows the susceptibility versus temperature from 10 to 800 K for the sample annealed at 327degC (600 K) under 6-Torr He and then measured in the same atmosphere. Between 25 and 750 K the susceptibility was found to be independent of applied magnetic field H up to H = 7.0 T (after correction for the influence of ferromagnetic impurities; see above). The enhancement of the susceptibility at low temperature presumably originates from a residual Curie-Weiss-like component, as mentioned above, but the gradual increase of the susceptibility with increasing temperature in the high-temperature region is not Curie-Weiss-like, but rather is similar to a Bonner-Fisher-type susceptibility,[4] as our fit to the data described below demonstrates.

### Synchrotron- and neutron-diffraction studies

The crystal structure of Sr2CuO3 at room temperature was first determined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction.[2] Powder neutron[9] and x-ray-diffraction[10] data at room temperature have also been reported. All of these studies assigned the orthorhombic _Immm_ space group to Sr2CuO3. We utilized neutron and synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction at low temperatures in order to search for any evidence of structural phase transitions or distortions, which would further lower the symmetry and, for example, contribute to the magnetic anisotropy by allowing a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction[11] to occur. It is known that the leading-order magnetic anisotropy in several of the cuprates, for example, La2CuO4, arises from the DM interaction.

Structural information determined by Rietveld refinement[12] of neutron-diffraction data (Fig. 4) obtained at 11 K are shown in Table 2. Aluminum reflections from the sample container used were excluded from the refinement. No superlattice peaks, which would indicate lattice distortion, were observed. High-resolution synchrotron x-ray-diffraction data (Fig. 5) at 12 K yielded a similar conclusion. These results show that there are no structural transformations in Sr2CuO3 between room temperature and 11 - 12 K.

We also note that recent muon spin rotation data[8] have been interpreted as offering evidence for three-dimensional magnetic ordering in Sr2CuO3 (synthesized in air) with a Neel temperature of 5 K. Since we observed no magnetic neutron powder diffraction at 1.5 K for a similar sample prepared in air, we conclude either that the Neel temperatures are different for these two samples, that only short-range magnetic ordering occurs, or that the ordered moment is simply too small to be observed by neutron powder diffraction. In fact, we have estimated an upper limit for the magnitude of the Cu2+ magnetic moment, which would have been observable in our neutron-diffraction measurements, if these moments exhibited long-range 3D antiferromagnetic order characterized by an antiferromagnetic propagation vector and spin direction similar to those observed for other

  K_{2}NiF_{4}-type oxides such as La_{2}CuO_{4} (Ref. 13), La_{2}NiO_{4} (Ref. 14), or Ca_{2}MnO_{4} (Ref. 15). For example, if the antiferromagnetic ordering was such that the (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},1) were an allowed magnetic Bragg reflection, then an ordered moment \geq 0.1\mu_{B} would have yielded an observable peak intensity. The same is approximately true for other magnetic peaks with (_hkl_) values corresponding to 0.7 A^{-1}\leq Q\leq2.0 A^{-1}. Thus, our sample either did not exhibit long-range magnetic order, or the size of the ordered moment is less than 0.1\mu_{B}. The latter situation could arise due to strong renormalization of the ordered moment as a result of quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations are generally more important in 1D than in 2D magnetic systems and are particularly large for spin-\frac{1}{2} ions such as Cu^{2+}. Table 3 lists classical and observed values for the ordered moments for several 1D antiferromagnets,^{16-17} clearly demonstrating the moment re-normalization due to quantum fluctuations. It is also obvious from these data that the effect of fluctuations indeed grows as the value of the spin decreases, and might therefore be expected to reduce the ordered moment by more than a factor of 2 in a spin-\frac{1}{2} material such as Sr_{2}CuO_{3}. Experimental resolution of this issue must

## Discussion

The magnetic Hamiltonian, which describes a spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg chain,

\[H = 2|J|\sum\limits_{i}{\bf S}_{i} \cdot {\bf S}_{i + 1}\ ,\]

was described previously.4 In this expression, J is the Cu^{2+}-Cu^{2+} intrachain superexchange coupling constant, and the summation extends over pairs of nearest-neighbor spins. It is worthwhile spending a moment to justify the use of such a model to describe the magnetic susceptibility of Sr2CuO3. The assumption that Sr2CuO3 is a one-dimensional magnetic system follows directly from the structure of this material (Fig. 1). Since the Cu^{2+} ions are only bonded to oxygen ions along the a direction with 180^{\circ} Cu--O--Cu bonds, there will be strong Cu^{2+}-Cu^{2+} antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions only in this direction. The additional assumption that this is a Heisenberg system is based upon the fact that the Cu^{2+} ion is spin \frac{1}{2} and thus has no single-ion anisotropy to first order. Furthermore, the structural studies reported here and previously[9, 10] for Sr2CuO3 demonstrate that there is an inversion center located midway between the Cu^{2+} ions in the Cu-O chains, which precludes the existence of a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) {\bf S}_{i} \times {\bf S}_{j} interaction.[11] In contrast, La2CuO4, an antiferromagnetic insulator, which is structurally similar to Sr2CuO3, has a leading-order magnetic anisotropy arising from a DM interaction, which is allowed by the rotational distortion of the CuO6 octahedra in the Bmab (orthorhombic) phase.[18] We also expect that the interchain magnetic coupling will be rather weak in this material, partly as a result of magnetic frustration. For example, the _interlayer_ interchain superexchange in Sr2CuO3 is fully frustrated _despite_ the orthorhombic symmetry, again in contrast to the situation in orthorhombic La2CuO4, where the _interlayer_ superexchange is not frustrated. This is true because, considering a given Cu^{2+} ion, the four nearest-neighbor Cu^{2+} ions in the nearest-neighbor chains in adjacent layers are _equidistant_ in Sr2CuO3, whereas in La2CuO4 there are _two_ such distances. The _intralayer_ interchain interaction is, on the other hand, not frustrated, but is still expected to be rather weak due to the absence of intervening oxygen ions between adjacent Cu^{2+} ions. Thus, in general, one expects Sr2CuO3 to be more Heisenberg-like than La2CuO4, the latter nevertheless being considered one of the best examples of a spin-\frac{1}{2} 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnet.[19] Therefore, we should expect Sr2CuO3 to be an excellent realization of a 1D Heisenberg antiferromagnet, and it seems very reasonable to attempt to describe its magnetic susceptibility with the Bonner-Fisher model for a spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain.

In order to fit the susceptibility data shown in Fig. 3 over a wide temperature range, we assume that the observed temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, \chi(T), consists of three terms:

\[\chi(T) = \chi_{\rm dia} + \chi_{PV} + \chi_{\rm spin}(T)\ ,\]

where \chi_{\rm dia} is due to the diamagnetism of the core electron shells, \chi_{PV} is the Van Vleck paramagnetism of the open shells of the Cu^{2+} ions, and \chi_{\rm spin}(T) is the Cu^{2+} spin susceptibility. In the absence of appreciable numbers of conduction electrons, the Pauli paramagnetism and the Landau diamagnetism should be negligible. \chi_{\rm dia} and \chi_{PV} are assumed to be temperature independent, and the values of \chi_{\rm dia} used were found in Ref. [20]. Furthermore, the spin susceptibility was separated into two parts:

\[\chi_{\rm spin}(T) = \rho(\chi_{\rm CW}) + (1 - \rho)\chi_{\rm BF}\]

where \chi_{\rm CW} is a Curie-Weiss-like component arising from finite length chains, which consist of an odd number of Cu^{2+} spins,[4] isolated Cu^{2+} spins, and/or other paramagnetic impurities, and \chi_{\rm BF} is the susceptibility of an S = \frac{1}{2} infinite isotropic Heisenberg chain (the Bonner-Fisher susceptibility[4, 21]). The coefficient \rho represents the defect and/or impurity level. There are no analytical solutions for the magnetic susceptibility of Heisenberg chains.[4] However, a useful closed-form approximation to \chi_{\rm BF} has been suggested[22] to be

\[\chi_{\rm BF} = \frac{Ng^{2}\mu_{B}^{2}S(S + 1)}{k_{B}T}\,\left[ \frac{0.25 + 0.14995x+0.30094x^{2}}{1 + 1.9862x+0.68854x^{2} + 6.0626x^{3}}\right]\]

with x = |J|/k_{B}T. The Curie-Weiss-like term is

\[\chi_{\rm CW} = \frac{Ng^{2}\mu_{B}^{2}S(S + 1)}{3k_{B}(T - \theta)}\ .\]

Assuming that g = 2.1, a typical value for cuprates,[3, 23] and S = \frac{1}{2}, we determine the following parameters by fitting Eq. (2) to the magnetic susceptibility data in Fig. 3 after subtracting the core diamagnetism:

\[\rho = 1.14 \times 10^{- 3}\ ({\rm i.\ e.\ ,\ impurity\ level} = 0.11\%)\ ,\] \[\theta = - 7.81\ {\rm K}\ ,\] \[|J|/k_{B} = 1307\ {\rm K}\ ,\] \[\chi_{PV} = 2.28 \times 10^{- 5}\ {\rm cm}^{3}/{\rm mole}\ .\]

The value of \chi_{PV} is comparable to that of other single Cu-O layer cuprates.[24] The fit using these parameter values is shown superimposed on the data in Fig. 3. The fit function has been extended to temperatures high enough to include the broad peak in the susceptibility arising from the appearance of short-range 1D order with decreasing temperature. Furthermore, several curves calculated assuming different values of J are plotted to give a sense of the sensitivity of the fit to this important parameter. From these curves we estimate the value of |J|/k_{B} to be 1300^{+ 100}_{- 200} K.

As mentioned previously, a Curie-Weiss-type term can originate from several possible sources, including nearly isolated Cu^{2+} ions associated with oxygen defects (oxy  gen vacancies or excess oxygen), some other kind of lattice defect, or magnetic impurities. However, an equally plausible explanation is that the Curie-like behavior originates from Cu-O 1D chains, which are randomly terminated by oxygen defects. As Bonner and Fisher have discussed,4 if the resulting chains have an even number of Cu2+ spins, then the total spin on the chain in the antiferromagnetically ordered state is zero at T = 0. If, however, the chains have an odd number of Cu2+ spins, then in the antiferromagnetically ordered state the net spin on the chain is \frac{1}{2}. Such chains of odd length will make contributions to the magnetic susceptibility, which are Curie-Weiss-like, although both the amplitude of the susceptibility divergence and the temperature at which the divergence occurs are depressed with increasing chain length by Cu2+-Cu2+ antiferromagnetic interactions. In the opposite limit, "chains" that have a length of only one Cu2+ will precisely exhibit Curie-Weiss behavior. To avoid the additional complications necessary to model contributions to the magnetic susceptibility arising from chains with a random distribution of lengths, we have chosen to represent the spin susceptibility for Sr2CuO3 simply as a Curie-Weiss term plus a Bonner-Fisher term. We thus assume that the inclusion of a Curie-Weiss term will adequately represent the contributions from odd length finite chains, as well as additional contributions due to isolated Cu2+ ions and/or impurities. This simplification minimizes the number of refinement parameters, and the quality of the fit indicates it to be a reasonable approximation.

The results of these measurements thus indicate that Sr2CuO3 is an excellent realization of a 1D spin-\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg antiferromagnet. In fact, it may be the best realization of such a system reported to date. In order to place Sr2CuO3 in the context of other 1D antiferromagnets, Table IV shows parameters for several such systems, which have appeared in the literature.17J_{1} and J_{2} are the two interchain magnetic coupling constants in orthogonal directions (in the b and c directions in Sr2CuO3). For all materials[16, 17, 25, 26] other than Sr2CuO3 in Table IV we have assumed that J_{1} = J_{2}. We have also calculated independent values of J_{1} and J_{2} for Sr2CuO3, assuming only dipolar interchain coupling, using the expression

\[J_{\alpha} = - \sum_{i}\frac{\mu \cdot \mu_{i}(3\cos^{2}\phi_{i} - 1)}{r_{i}^{3}}\]

, where the sum is over the Cu moments \mu_{i} in the same (J_{\alpha} = J_{1}) or different (J_{\alpha} = J_{2}) layers, \tau_{i} is the vector from the moment \mu to the moment \mu_{i}, and \phi_{i} is the angle between \tau_{i} and the a axis. For this calculation the magnetic structure was assumed to be the same as that reported for Sr2CuO2Cl2 (Ref. 27): in our case we assume the Cn2+ spins to be either parallel or antiparallel to the a axis. The summation in Eq. (6) included Cu2+ moments within a distance r_{i} sufficient to achieve convergence.

Values of J_{1} (= J_{2}) in Table IV were calculated from the following expressions28-30 using experimental values[8, 17] of T_{N} and J:

\[\frac{kT_{N}}{|J|} = \frac{4S(S + 1)/3}{I(\eta_{1},\eta_{2})}\]

, where \eta_{1} = J_{1}/J, \eta_{2} = J_{2}/J, and

\begin{table}

For the case, where _J_/_J_ > 1, and J 1/_J_ 2 > 1, Eq. (8) can be approximated by [30]

\[I(\eta_{1},\eta_{2}) = \frac{0.64}{\sqrt{\eta_{1}}}\left[1+0.253\ln\left[\frac{\eta_{1}}{\eta_{2}
