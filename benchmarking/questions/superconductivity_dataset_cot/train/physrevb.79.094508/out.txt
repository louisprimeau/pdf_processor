Electron probe microanalysis of a cleaved surface of a BaNi_{2}As_{2} single crystal was performed on a JEOL JSM-840 scanning electron microscope using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a current of 20 nA with an EDAX brand energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) device. This gave Ba:Ni:As=1:2:2. EDS analyses on the BaFeNiAs_{2} crystal indicated Ba:Ni:Fe:As ratio of \sim1:1:1:2.

Powder x-ray diffraction data at room temperature were collected using PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD with an X'celerator position sensitive detector (Cu K_{\alpha} radiation) for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and BaFeNiAs_{2}. For BaNi_{2}As_{2} the data were also collected at 105 K using an Anton Parr TTK450 low-temperature stage. The unit-cell parameters were refined from full pattern LaBail fits using the program fullprof.[28]

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction data on BaNi_{2}As_{2} were also collected at 293 K. For room-temperature data collection the crystal was mounted inside a 0.3 mm capillary filled with argon. Further details for this procedure can be found in Ref. [29]. For low-temperature data collection, a small single crystal of BaNi_{2}As_{2} was mounted on the top of a thin glass capillary using the Fombin Z15 oil in a stream of nitrogen gas at 173 K. Further details on crystal mounting can be found in Ref. [30]. The single crystal was transferred to a Bruker Apex II diffractometer using cryotongues and placed under the stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. The single-crystal data were collected at 100(1) K, then the temperature of nitrogen gas was raised to 160(1) K and the data were collected again.

dc magnetization was measured as a function of temperature and field using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and BaFeNiAs_{2}. For a temperature sweep experiment, the sample was cooled to 1.8 K in zero field (zf) and data were collected by warming from 1.8 to 400 K in an applied field of 10 kOe. The magnetic-susceptibility results are presented per mole of formula unit (cm^{3}/mol), \chi, along c and ab crystallographic directions. The polycrystalline averages of the susceptibilities can be estimated by \chi=[2X_{ab}+\chi_{c}]/3.

Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity was performed on a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The electrical contacts were placed on samples in standard four-probe geometry, using Pt wires and silver epoxy (EPOS-TEK H20E). The resistivity was measured in the ab plane (\rho_{ab}) and c direction (\rho_{c}) for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and BaFeNiAs_{2}. Specific-heat data, C_{p}(7), were also obtained using the PPMS via the relaxation method from 200 K to 2 K. For BaNi_{2}As_{2} data were collected down to 0.4 K using a ^{3}He insert.

## III Results

### Crystal structures

At room temperature, the structures are identified as the tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2} (I4/mmm, Z=2), based on x-ray powder-diffraction data. The lattice constants for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaFeNiAs_{2}, and BaNi_{2}As_{2} are shown in Fig. 1, along with data for BaCo_{2}As_{2}. On moving from Fe to Ni, a increases and c decreases. This results in an increased distortion of the tetrahedral environment of the transition-metal atoms (T) in BaT_{2}As_{2}. The lattice parameters of BaFe_{2}As_{2} are a =3.9635(5)A and c =13.022(2)A, and those of BaFeNiAs_{2} are a=4.0002(1)A and c =12.6767(3)A, similar to those of BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[31] The lattice parameters of BaNi_{2}As_{2} are a =4.1441(1)A and c =11.6325(3)A, slightly different from those recently reported for the Pb-flux-grown crystals with a=4.112(4)A and c =11.54(2)A,[18] and in better agreement with the original reports.[32]

With cooling, BaFe_{2}As_{2} and BaNi_{2}As_{2} undergo structural phase transitions to lower symmetry. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the transition at 136 K is associated with a tetragonal to orthorhombic Fmmm change in space group. Below the phase transition, the four equal Fe-Fe bonds at 280.2 p.m. are split into two pairs with 280.8 p.m. and 287.7 p.m. lengths.[2] For BaFeNiAs_{2}, the low-temperature diffraction was not studied, as no structural transition is expected from the bulk properties (Sec. III B 3). For BaNi_{2}As_{2}, a tetragonal to orthorhombic first-order phase transition was suggested below T_{0} =130 K only by analogy with AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ba, Sr, Ca) (Refs. [22, 23, 24, 25]) compounds, however, we find that the symmetry of the low-temperature structure is triclinic.

Upon cooling below 130 K, a structural distortion is observed in BaNi_{2}As_{2}. Figure 2(a) shows two sections of powder x-ray diffraction data collected at 298 and 105 K, and illustrates the complex diffraction pattern observed at low temperature due to the splitting of the Bragg peaks as the symmetry is reduced. The diffraction pattern at 105 K could only be indexed after removal of all of the symmetry constraints, resulting in a triclinic unit cell. Difficulties related to preferred orientation and the complexity of the low-temperature structure of BaNi_{2}As_{2} precluded satisfactory refinement of the crystal structure from the powder x-ray diffraction data. In order to identify the low-temperature unit cell accurately, single-crystal x-ray diffraction was employed.

The single-crystal x-ray diffraction data for BaNi_{2}As_{2} were collected at 100 K. Due to the symmetry breaking, the low-temperature crystal was twinned, requiring a careful

  symmetry analysis before any structural solution and refinement was possible. Because the unit-cell distortion is small and the resolution of the charge-coupled device (CCD) detector is relatively poor, the spots resulting from different twin components could not be spatially resolved for unit-cell determination or intensity integration. Still, indexing of the Bragg reflections suggested a possible monoclinic (\alpha= \sim 89^{\circ}) or even triclinic symmetry. Because the x-ray powder-diffraction data is immune to twinning problems and provides a larger angular resolution, it was employed to differentiate between the two cells. As described above, the multiple peaks splitting of the powder pattern at 105 K could be indexed only within the triclinic cell.

The structural solution and refinement of the single-crystal x-ray data were undertaken both in the P1 and P\overline{1} space groups. While the P1 space group provided a reasonable solution, strong correlations between different sites containing the same atom types pointed to a higher symmetry. Thus, the structural solution and refinement proceeded in the P\overline{1} space group. A numerical absorption correction was based on the crystal shape derived from the optical face indexing. The twinning law accounting for the tetragonal-type twinning (rotation by 90^{\circ} around the original tetragonal axis) was employed during the final stages of refinement. The refined fraction of the major twin component was 87%, while the scattering contributions of the other three components were 2, 3, and 8%. The structural parameters at 293 and 100 K, from single-crystal x-ray diffraction, are listed in Table 1. The resulting triclinic unit cell is outlined in Fig. 2(b), and can be visualized as a distortion of the primitive unit cell of the body-centered ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure. The powder-diffraction pattern at 105 K was also indexed to a similar triclinic cell [Fig. 2(a)], with a=6.4979(9)A, b=6.4911(9)A, c=6.4444(9)A, \alpha=37.30(1)^{\circ}, \beta=54.36(1)^{\circ}, and \gamma=37.39(1)^{\circ}. After beating to 160 K, the single-crystal x-ray data could be indexed in the tetragonal unit cell. The peaks in the 298 K powder-diffraction data were also indexed to the tetragonal cell [Fig. 2(a)].

At room temperature the transition-metal atoms lie on a perfect square net in the ab plane of the tetragonal structure, and for BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the Ni-Ni distance is simply a/2^{1/2} =2.9327(6)A. In BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the further reduction in symmetry below T_{0} results in a distorted Ni network as shown in Fig. 2(c). The Ni atoms still lie nearly in a plane, but within the plane form zigzag chains with short Ni-Ni contacts (2.8 A). The chains are separated by significantly longer Ni-Ni distances (3.1 A).

Finally, we note that reciprocal space analysis of the 100 K single-crystal x-ray diffraction indicated tripling of one of the directions (the b direction within the tetragonal setting), shown in Fig. 2(d). The superstructure reflections were very weak, with their intensities being 2 to 3 times the background level. Because of the low intensities and limited number of the superstructure reflections, no reliable structural solution could be obtained. While the tetragonal-type twinning would require the presence of the superstructure reflections along the other tetragonal direction, the weak nature of the superstructure reflections and dominance of one twin component are the most likely reasons that no superstructure reflections were observed along another direction.

### Physical properties

#### 1. BaFe_{2}As_{2}

For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the magnetic susceptibility at room temperature gives \chi_{c}^{\,\leftrightarrow\,}\chi_{ab}^{\,\leftrightarrow\,}6.7\times10^{-4} cm^{3} mol^{-1} [Fig. 3(a)].

Figure 2: (a) For BaNi_{2}As_{2}, two sets of Bragg peaks from powder x-ray diffraction data at 298 and 105 K. (b) The low-temperature triclinic symmetry for BaNi_{2}As_{2}; the unit cell is represented with lines. (c) The distorted Ni network for low-temperature BaNi_{2}As_{2} structure. The Ni atoms form zigzag chains with short and longer Ni-Ni bonds within the plane. (d) The image of the reciprocal space for BaNi_{2}As_{2} at 100 K indicates weak superstructure reflections, tripling along the b direction.

  The susceptibility decreases linearly with decreasing temperature, and drops abruptly below \sim135 K with \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab} below. As seen in the bottom inset of Fig. 3(a), the field-dependent magnetization is linear at 1.8 K. For this compound, the polycrystalline average of the susceptibility data are presented as d(\chi T)/dT (Ref. [33]) versus temperature, to infer an antiferromagnetic transition temperature, at T_{N} = 132 K [the top inset of Fig. 3(a)].

Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity for BaFe_{2}As_{2} decreases with decreasing temperature, consistent with metallic behavior [Fig. 3(b)]. The resistivity behavior is highly anisotropic with \rho_{c}>\rho_{ab}. At room temperature, \rho_{ab} =0.50 m\Omega cm and \rho_{c}=16.44 m\Omega cm for BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The residual-resistivity ratio (RRR) (=\rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{2\text{ K}}) is 4 along both directions. Below \sim135 K and for \rho_{c} and \rho_{ab} there is a sharp steplike drop. This feature is best manifested in the derivative of resistivity, d\rho/dT, giving a peak at 132(1) K [bottom inset of Fig. 3(b)]. The magnitude of the resistivity at 2 K and 8 T is higher than the zero-field value for BaFe_{2}As_{2} [top inset of Fig. 3(b)]. This \rho_{ab} rise corresponds to a positive magnetoresistance, (\rho_{8\text{ T}}\sim\rho_{0})/\rho_{0}, of 27.7 % at 2 K. The magnetoresistance for \rho_{c} is slightly negative and -4.6%, at 2 K.

Figure 3(c) gives the temperature dependence of specific heat. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, specific heat gives a pronounced lambda anomaly, peaking at 132(1) K. Below \sim6 K, C/T has a linear T^{2} dependence [bottom inset of Fig. 3(c)]. The fitted Sommerfeld coefficient, \gamma, for BaFe_{2}As_{2} is 6.1 mJ/(K^{2} mol) [or 3.0 mJ/(K^{2} mol Fe)]. The Debye temperature is \theta_{D} = 260 K estimated above 150 K, using the calculated values of the T/\theta_{D} dependence of the Debye specific-heat model. Previously, values of \gamma=16(2)mJ/(K^{2} mol) and \theta_{D} =134(1)K were reported from fits between 3.1 and 14 K for BaFe_{2}As_{2}.^{2}

BaFe_{2}As_{2} properties (Fig. 3) demonstrate the consistency among of C(T), d(\chi T)/dT and d\rho/dT in determining T_{N} =132(1)K. This transition temperature is lower than the previously reported value of 140 K.^{2}

### BaNi_{2}As_{2}

For BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the magnetic susceptibility is anisotropic with \chi_{ab}/\chi_{c}=1.6 at 10 kOe [Fig. 4(a)]. \chi is roughly temperature independent and presents only a small drop at T_{0} = 132 K and a rise below \sim12 K. The field-dependent magnetization is linear at 1.8 K along c and ab crystallographic directions [Fig. 4(a), inset].

BaNi_{2}As_{2} shows metallic behavior [Fig. 4(b)] with \rho_{c}>\rho_{ab}. At room temperature, \rho_{ab}=0.07 m\Omega cm and \rho_{c} =4.69 m\Omega cm. Along c and below T_{0}, resistivity abruptly drops two orders of magnitude. Along ab there is a sharp increase at T_{0} in \rho followed by a continuous decrease with decreasing temperature. The RRR (=\rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{2\text{ K}}) is 8 within the ab, suggesting less impurity scattering compared to crystals grown out of Pb.^{19} The superconductivity downturn in resistivity starts around 1.5 K in our pure crystal [inset of Fig. 4(b)], similar to the recently reported.^{19}T_{c} as determined by the zero resistance state is 0.69 K, comparable to the crystals grown in Pb flux.^{19} There is no noticeable magnetoresistance at 8 Tesla for BaNi_{2}As_{2} at 1.8 K (data not shown).

Figure 4(c) gives the temperature dependence of specific heat of BaNi_{2}As_{2}. There is a sharp pronounced transition at T_{0}=132 K with a width of less than 0.2 K, in contrast to the broader second-order-like transition observed in BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The abrupt changes in both specific heat and \rho_{c} indicate that the phase transition at T_{0} is first-order type. Between 1.8 and \sim6 K, the normal-state electronic specific-heat coefficient,

The Debye temperature is estimated as \theta_{D} = 250 K. The value of \gamma_{n} is larger than the corresponding value for LaNiAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}, \gamma_{n} = 4.75 mJ/(K^{2} mol),[17] and comparable to other layered

  superconductors Li_{x}Nbs_{2} with \gamma_{n}=10 mJ/(K^{2} mol) (Ref. 34) and Na_{0.75}CoO_{2}\gamma_{n}=24 mJ/(K^{2} mol).[35, 36] Previous measurements of Pb-flux-grown crystal gave \gamma_{n} = 10.8(1)mJ/(K^{2} mol) and \theta_{D}=206 K.[19]

For BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the temperature dependence of C/T in several fields for H\|ab is shown in Fig. 5. In zero field, there is a sharp anomaly at T_{c}=0.69 K with a jump \Delta C = 12.6 mJ/(K mol). Taking the value of the Sommerfeld coefficient at T_{c}, this gives a ratio of \Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c}=1.38, roughly comparable to a value of 1.43 predicted by weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory and confirms bulk superconductivity. As the magnetic field increases, the transition becomes broader and shifts to lower temperatures. The upper critical field H_{c2} is determined by onset criterion, demonstrated by the dashed line, and displayed in the inset of Fig. 5. The solid line is a linear fit to the data, yielding a slope of -dH_{c2}/dT_{c}=-0.142 T/K. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg equation H_{c2}(0)=-0.693 T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT_{c}),[37] this gives H_{c2}(0) = 0.069 T. A zero-temperature, coherence length of \xi_{\rm GL}(0) \approx 691 A is obtained using Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length formula \xi_{\rm GL}=[\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2}(0)]^{1/2}, where \Phi_{0}=2.07 \times 10^{-7} Oe cm^{2}.

### BaFeNiAs_{2}

The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility at 10 kOe for BaFeNiAs_{2} is found to increase with decreasing temperature [Fig. 6(a)]. The averaged polycrystalline magnetic susceptibility at 1.8 K is \chi=2.3 \times 10^{-3} cm^{3} mol^{-1} and at room temperature is 9.3 \times 10^{-4} cm^{3} mol^{-1}. These values are comparable to that for BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[31]

Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity gives metallic behavior for BaFeNiAs_{2} [Fig. 6(b)]. At room temperature, \rho_{ab}=0.08 m\Omega cm and \rho_{c}=2.25 m\Omega cm. The RRR is 12 along ab, but only \sim2 along c. There is no noticeable mag

The inset shows the upper critical field H_{c2} for H\|ab assigned using the onset criterion, with the solid line representing a least-squares fit to the data.

Inset of (b) is the plot of \rho_{ab} vs T^{2} and linear fit between 2 and 68 K. The inset of (c) is the C/T vs T^{2} and a linear fit between 1.8 and 7 K for BaCo_{2}As_{2}.

  notoresistance in 8 Tesla (data not shown). For BaFeNiAs_{2} the resistivity data exhibit a quadratic temperature dependence, \rho = \rho_{o}+AT^{2}, over a wide temperature range of 1.8 to \sim68 K. The A value is a measure of the extent of electron correlations. Plotted in the inset of Fig. 6(b) is \rho(T^{2}), and linear fits in this region. For \rho_{ab}, A = 3.1\times10^{-6}\rm\frac{m\Omega}{cm} K^{-2} and it is slightly larger than that for BaCo_{2}As_{2} at 2.2 \times 10^{-6}\rm\frac{m\Omega}{cm} K^{-2},[31] consistent with the formation of a Fermi-liquid state.

Figure 6(c) gives the temperature dependence of specific heat results. For BaFeNiAs_{2}, there are no features in specific heat up to 200 K, similar to that for BaCo_{2}As_{2}. The inset of Fig. 5(b) shows C/T versus T^{2} dependence. BaFeNiAs_{2} gives a slight upturn below \sim4 K; the \gamma is remarkably similar to those for BaCo_{2}As_{2}. For BaCo_{2}As_{2}, C/T vs T^{2} is linear below \sim8 K consistent with a Fermi liquid plus phonon contribution. BaCo_{2}As_{2} gives \gamma=41.6 mJ/(K^{2} mol) [or 20.8 mJ/(K^{2} mol Co)]. For BaCo_{2}As_{2} the Wilson ratio, R_{w} = \pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}\chi^{\prime}(3/2\mu_{B}^{2}), is \sim7 from \chi_{ab} and \sim10 from \chi_{c}.[31] These values well exceed unity for a free-electron system and indicate that the system is close to ferromagnetism.

## IV Final discussions

The shrinking of the crystal lattice is observed from BaFe_{2}As_{2}, to BaFeNiAs_{2}, and finally to BaNi_{2}As_{2}. The cell volumes at room temperature are 204.567(2)A^{3}, 202.8517(3)A^{3}, and 199.7686(2)A^{3}, respectively. With cooling, BaFe_{2}As_{2} and BaNi_{2}As_{2} undergo structural transitions. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, a second-order-like transition is observed at 132(1) K, associated with a tetragonal to orthorhombic _Fnum_ distortion, and a SDW magnetic transition. In contrast to this broader transition, for BaNi_{2}As_{2} there is sharp pronounced feature at T_{0}=131 K, seen in \rho(T) and C_{p} results. This first-order transition was associated with a reduction in the lattice symmetry from tetragonal to triclinic P\overline{1}. The most interesting effect of the structural distortions in these two compounds is the resulting change in the Fe or Ni network. At room temperature the transition-metal atoms lie on a perfect square net in the ab plane of the tetragonal structure. In BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the low-temperature phase is orthorhombic and the Fe network is distorted from square to rectangular, commensurate with magnetic ordering. In BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the further reduction in symmetry below T_{0} results in a more distorted Ni network, and zigzag chains of Ni atoms. BaFeNiAs_{2} shows no evidence of structural or magnetic transitions.

The basic thermodynamic and transport properties of pure BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and BaNiFeAs_{2} crystals show differences between them. Unlike BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the magnetic susceptibility for BaNi_{2}As_{2} is roughly temperature independent and presents only a small anomaly at T_{0}. At room temperature, \chi_{\rm avg} (\times10^{-4}\rm\frac{cm^{3}}{mol^{-1}}) is smallest for BaNi_{2}As_{2} at 3, and slightly larger for BaFe_{2}As_{2} at 7 and largest for BaFeNiAs_{2} at 9. BaNi_{2}As_{2} is more conductive at room temperature, compared to BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The room-temperature resistivity for BaFeNiAs_{2} and BaNi_{2}As_{2} are at \sim0.08 m\Omega cm, compared to \rho_{ab}=0.50 m\Omega cm for BaFe_{2}As_{2}. At room temperature, \rho_{c}=16.44 mJ cm for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, approximately one order of magnitude larger than for BaFeNiAs_{2} and BaNi_{2}As_{2}.

Superconductivity in BaNi_{2}As_{2} is connected to pure sample and those lightly doped with Fe. The BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2} series of 0\leqx\leq0.2 gives the highest T_{c}^{\rm cea}=21 K for x =0.[38]. From temperature dependent resistivity measurements, we find no sign of superconductivity down to 0.4 K for x=0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1. The results of BaFeNiAs_{2} was given here, as a half point between BaNi_{2}As_{2} (d^{8}) and BaFe_{2}As_{2} (d^{6}). BaFeNiAs_{2} is found to show a similar magnitude of magnetic susceptibility as well as specific heat \gamma to BaCo_{2}As_{2}, which was suggested to be in a close proximity to a quantum critical point and of strong fluctuations.[31] The calculated local-density approximations show hybridization between As p states and Fe d states in BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [39]) similar to BaNi_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [40]) and BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[31] However the Fermi level for BaNi_{2}As_{2} is shifted up because of the higher valence electron count in Ni^{2+} (3d^{6}) compared to Fe^{2+} (3d^{6}). With a larger Fermi surface, BaNi_{2}As_{2} shows large Fermi surfaces and lower density of states.[13, 40] Based on band-structure calculations, the superconductivity of BaNi_{2}As_{2} appears to be rather different from BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The Ni phase can be understood within the context of conventional electron-phonon theory, while the high-T_{c} Fe superconductors cannot be described in this way.

2 January 200920094508200  pendicular to the plane of the crystals. The BaNi_{2}As_{2} crystals were found to be highly air sensitive.

Electron probe microanalysis of a cleaved surface of a BaNi_{2}As_{2} single crystal was performed on a JEOL JSM-840 scanning electron microscope using an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a current of 20 nA with an EDAX brand energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) device. This gave Ba:Ni:As=1:2:2. EDS analyses on the BaFeNiAs_{2} crystal indicated Ba:Ni:Fe:As ratio of \sim1:1:1:2.

Powder x-ray diffraction data at room temperature were collected using PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD with an X'celerator position sensitive detector (Cu K_{\alpha} radiation) for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and BaFeNiAs_{2}. For BaNi_{2}As_{2} the data were also collected at 105 K using an Anton Parr TTK450 low-temperature stage. The unit-cell parameters were refined from full pattern LaBail fits using the program fullprof.[28]

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction data on BaNi_{2}As_{2} were also collected at 293 K. For room-temperature data collection the crystal was mounted inside a 0.3 mm capillary filled with argon. Further details for this procedure can be found in Ref. [29]. For low-temperature data collection, a small single crystal of BaNi_{2}As_{2} was mounted on the top of a thin glass capillary using the Fombin Z15 oil in a stream of nitrogen gas at 173 K. Further details on crystal mounting can be found in Ref. [30]. The single crystal was transferred to a Bruker Apex II diffractometer using cryotongues and placed under the stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. The single-crystal data were collected at 100(1) K, then the temperature of nitrogen gas was raised to 160(1) K and the data were collected again.

dc magnetization was measured as a function of temperature and field using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and BaFeNiAs_{2}. For a temperature sweep experiment, the sample was cooled to 1.8 K in zero field (zf) and data were collected by warming from 1.8 to 400 K in an applied field of 10 kOe. The magnetic-susceptibility results are presented per mole of formula unit (cm^{3}/mol), \chi, along c and ab crystallographic directions. The polycrystalline averages of the susceptibilities can be estimated by \chi=[2X_{ab}+\chi_{c}]/3.

Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity was performed on a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The electrical contacts were placed on samples in standard four-probe geometry, using Pt wires and silver epoxy (EPOS-TEK H20E). The resistivity was measured in the ab plane (\rho_{ab}) and c direction (\rho_{c}) for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and BaFeNiAs_{2}. Specific-heat data, C_{p}(7), were also obtained using the PPMS via the relaxation method from 200 K to 2 K. For BaNi_{2}As_{2} data were collected down to 0.4 K using a ^{3}He insert.

## III Results

### Crystal structures

At room temperature, the structures are identified as the tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2} (I4/mmm, Z=2), based on x-ray powder-diffraction data. The lattice constants for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaFeNiAs_{2}, and BaNi_{2}As_{2} are shown in Fig. 1, along with data for BaCo_{2}As_{2}. On moving from Fe to Ni, a increases and c decreases. This results in an increased distortion of the tetrahedral environment of the transition-metal atoms (T) in BaT_{2}As_{2}. The lattice parameters of BaFe_{2}As_{2} are a =3.9635(5)A and c =13.022(2)A, and those of BaFeNiAs_{2} are a=4.0002(1)A and c =12.6767(3)A, similar to those of BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[31] The lattice parameters of BaNi_{2}As_{2} are a =4.1441(1)A and c =11.6325(3)A, slightly different from those recently reported for the Pb-flux-grown crystals with a=4.112(4)A and c =11.54(2)A,[18] and in better agreement with the original reports.[32]

With cooling, BaFe_{2}As_{2} and BaNi_{2}As_{2} undergo structural phase transitions to lower symmetry. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the transition at 136 K is associated with a tetragonal to orthorhombic Fmmm change in space group. Below the phase transition, the four equal Fe-Fe bonds at 280.2 p.m. are split into two pairs with 280.8 p.m. and 287.7 p.m. lengths.[2] For BaFeNiAs_{2}, the low-temperature diffraction was not studied, as no structural transition is expected from the bulk properties (Sec. III B 3). For BaNi_{2}As_{2}, a tetragonal to orthorhombic first-order phase transition was suggested below T_{0} =130 K only by analogy with AFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Ba, Sr, Ca) (Refs. [22, 23, 24, 25]) compounds, however, we find that the symmetry of the low-temperature structure is triclinic.

Upon cooling below 130 K, a structural distortion is observed in BaNi_{2}As_{2}. Figure 2(a) shows two sections of powder x-ray diffraction data collected at 298 and 105 K, and illustrates the complex diffraction pattern observed at low temperature due to the splitting of the Bragg peaks as the symmetry is reduced. The diffraction pattern at 105 K could only be indexed after removal of all of the symmetry constraints, resulting in a triclinic unit cell. Difficulties related to preferred orientation and the complexity of the low-temperature structure of BaNi_{2}As_{2} precluded satisfactory refinement of the crystal structure from the powder x-ray diffraction data. In order to identify the low-temperature unit cell accurately, single-crystal x-ray diffraction was employed.

The single-crystal x-ray diffraction data for BaNi_{2}As_{2} were collected at 100 K. Due to the symmetry breaking, the low-temperature crystal was twinned, requiring a careful

  symmetry analysis before any structural solution and refinement was possible. Because the unit-cell distortion is small and the resolution of the charge-coupled device (CCD) detector is relatively poor, the spots resulting from different twin components could not be spatially resolved for unit-cell determination or intensity integration. Still, indexing of the Bragg reflections suggested a possible monoclinic (\alpha= \sim 89^{\circ}) or even triclinic symmetry. Because the x-ray powder-diffraction data is immune to twinning problems and provides a larger angular resolution, it was employed to differentiate between the two cells. As described above, the multiple peaks splitting of the powder pattern at 105 K could be indexed only within the triclinic cell.

The structural solution and refinement of the single-crystal x-ray data were undertaken both in the P1 and P\overline{1} space groups. While the P1 space group provided a reasonable solution, strong correlations between different sites containing the same atom types pointed to a higher symmetry. Thus, the structural solution and refinement proceeded in the P\overline{1} space group. A numerical absorption correction was based on the crystal shape derived from the optical face indexing. The twinning law accounting for the tetragonal-type twinning (rotation by 90^{\circ} around the original tetragonal axis) was employed during the final stages of refinement. The refined fraction of the major twin component was 87%, while the scattering contributions of the other three components were 2, 3, and 8%. The structural parameters at 293 and 100 K, from single-crystal x-ray diffraction, are listed in Table 1. The resulting triclinic unit cell is outlined in Fig. 2(b), and can be visualized as a distortion of the primitive unit cell of the body-centered ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure. The powder-diffraction pattern at 105 K was also indexed to a similar triclinic cell [Fig. 2(a)], with a=6.4979(9)A, b=6.4911(9)A, c=6.4444(9)A, \alpha=37.30(1)^{\circ}, \beta=54.36(1)^{\circ}, and \gamma=37.39(1)^{\circ}. After beating to 160 K, the single-crystal x-ray data could be indexed in the tetragonal unit cell. The peaks in the 298 K powder-diffraction data were also indexed to the tetragonal cell [Fig. 2(a)].

At room temperature the transition-metal atoms lie on a perfect square net in the ab plane of the tetragonal structure, and for BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the Ni-Ni distance is simply a/2^{1/2} =2.9327(6)A. In BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the further reduction in symmetry below T_{0} results in a distorted Ni network as shown in Fig. 2(c). The Ni atoms still lie nearly in a plane, but within the plane form zigzag chains with short Ni-Ni contacts (2.8 A). The chains are separated by significantly longer Ni-Ni distances (3.1 A).

Finally, we note that reciprocal space analysis of the 100 K single-crystal x-ray diffraction indicated tripling of one of the directions (the b direction within the tetragonal setting), shown in Fig. 2(d). The superstructure reflections were very weak, with their intensities being 2 to 3 times the background level. Because of the low intensities and limited number of the superstructure reflections, no reliable structural solution could be obtained. While the tetragonal-type twinning would require the presence of the superstructure reflections along the other tetragonal direction, the weak nature of the superstructure reflections and dominance of one twin component are the most likely reasons that no superstructure reflections were observed along another direction.

### Physical properties

#### 1. BaFe_{2}As_{2}

For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the magnetic susceptibility at room temperature gives \chi_{c}^{\,\leftrightarrow\,}\chi_{ab}^{\,\leftrightarrow\,}6.7\times10^{-4} cm^{3} mol^{-1} [Fig. 3(a)].

Figure 2: (a) For BaNi_{2}As_{2}, two sets of Bragg peaks from powder x-ray diffraction data at 298 and 105 K. (b) The low-temperature triclinic symmetry for BaNi_{2}As_{2}; the unit cell is represented with lines. (c) The distorted Ni network for low-temperature BaNi_{2}As_{2} structure. The Ni atoms form zigzag chains with short and longer Ni-Ni bonds within the plane. (d) The image of the reciprocal space for BaNi_{2}As_{2} at 100 K indicates weak superstructure reflections, tripling along the b direction.

  The susceptibility decreases linearly with decreasing temperature, and drops abruptly below \sim135 K with \chi_{c}>\chi_{ab} below. As seen in the bottom inset of Fig. 3(a), the field-dependent magnetization is linear at 1.8 K. For this compound, the polycrystalline average of the susceptibility data are presented as d(\chi T)/dT (Ref. [33]) versus temperature, to infer an antiferromagnetic transition temperature, at T_{N} = 132 K [the top inset of Fig. 3(a)].

Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity for BaFe_{2}As_{2} decreases with decreasing temperature, consistent with metallic behavior [Fig. 3(b)]. The resistivity behavior is highly anisotropic with \rho_{c}>\rho_{ab}. At room temperature, \rho_{ab} =0.50 m\Omega cm and \rho_{c}=16.44 m\Omega cm for BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The residual-resistivity ratio (RRR) (=\rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{2\text{ K}}) is 4 along both directions. Below \sim135 K and for \rho_{c} and \rho_{ab} there is a sharp steplike drop. This feature is best manifested in the derivative of resistivity, d\rho/dT, giving a peak at 132(1) K [bottom inset of Fig. 3(b)]. The magnitude of the resistivity at 2 K and 8 T is higher than the zero-field value for BaFe_{2}As_{2} [top inset of Fig. 3(b)]. This \rho_{ab} rise corresponds to a positive magnetoresistance, (\rho_{8\text{ T}}\sim\rho_{0})/\rho_{0}, of 27.7 % at 2 K. The magnetoresistance for \rho_{c} is slightly negative and -4.6%, at 2 K.

Figure 3(c) gives the temperature dependence of specific heat. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, specific heat gives a pronounced lambda anomaly, peaking at 132(1) K. Below \sim6 K, C/T has a linear T^{2} dependence [bottom inset of Fig. 3(c)]. The fitted Sommerfeld coefficient, \gamma, for BaFe_{2}As_{2} is 6.1 mJ/(K^{2} mol) [or 3.0 mJ/(K^{2} mol Fe)]. The Debye temperature is \theta_{D} = 260 K estimated above 150 K, using the calculated values of the T/\theta_{D} dependence of the Debye specific-heat model. Previously, values of \gamma=16(2)mJ/(K^{2} mol) and \theta_{D} =134(1)K were reported from fits between 3.1 and 14 K for BaFe_{2}As_{2}.^{2}

BaFe_{2}As_{2} properties (Fig. 3) demonstrate the consistency among of C(T), d(\chi T)/dT and d\rho/dT in determining T_{N} =132(1)K. This transition temperature is lower than the previously reported value of 140 K.^{2}

### BaNi_{2}As_{2}

For BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the magnetic susceptibility is anisotropic with \chi_{ab}/\chi_{c}=1.6 at 10 kOe [Fig. 4(a)]. \chi is roughly temperature independent and presents only a small drop at T_{0} = 132 K and a rise below \sim12 K. The field-dependent magnetization is linear at 1.8 K along c and ab crystallographic directions [Fig. 4(a), inset].

BaNi_{2}As_{2} shows metallic behavior [Fig. 4(b)] with \rho_{c}>\rho_{ab}. At room temperature, \rho_{ab}=0.07 m\Omega cm and \rho_{c} =4.69 m\Omega cm. Along c and below T_{0}, resistivity abruptly drops two orders of magnitude. Along ab there is a sharp increase at T_{0} in \rho followed by a continuous decrease with decreasing temperature. The RRR (=\rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{2\text{ K}}) is 8 within the ab, suggesting less impurity scattering compared to crystals grown out of Pb.^{19} The superconductivity downturn in resistivity starts around 1.5 K in our pure crystal [inset of Fig. 4(b)], similar to the recently reported.^{19}T_{c} as determined by the zero resistance state is 0.69 K, comparable to the crystals grown in Pb flux.^{19} There is no noticeable magnetoresistance at 8 Tesla for BaNi_{2}As_{2} at 1.8 K (data not shown).

Figure 4(c) gives the temperature dependence of specific heat of BaNi_{2}As_{2}. There is a sharp pronounced transition at T_{0}=132 K with a width of less than 0.2 K, in contrast to the broader second-order-like transition observed in BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The abrupt changes in both specific heat and \rho_{c} indicate that the phase transition at T_{0} is first-order type. Between 1.8 and \sim6 K, the normal-state electronic specific-heat coefficient,

The Debye temperature is estimated as \theta_{D} = 250 K. The value of \gamma_{n} is larger than the corresponding value for LaNiAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1}, \gamma_{n} = 4.75 mJ/(K^{2} mol),[17] and comparable to other layered

  superconductors Li_{x}Nbs_{2} with \gamma_{n}=10 mJ/(K^{2} mol) (Ref. 34) and Na_{0.75}CoO_{2}\gamma_{n}=24 mJ/(K^{2} mol).[35, 36] Previous measurements of Pb-flux-grown crystal gave \gamma_{n} = 10.8(1)mJ/(K^{2} mol) and \theta_{D}=206 K.[19]

For BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the temperature dependence of C/T in several fields for H\|ab is shown in Fig. 5. In zero field, there is a sharp anomaly at T_{c}=0.69 K with a jump \Delta C = 12.6 mJ/(K mol). Taking the value of the Sommerfeld coefficient at T_{c}, this gives a ratio of \Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c}=1.38, roughly comparable to a value of 1.43 predicted by weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory and confirms bulk superconductivity. As the magnetic field increases, the transition becomes broader and shifts to lower temperatures. The upper critical field H_{c2} is determined by onset criterion, demonstrated by the dashed line, and displayed in the inset of Fig. 5. The solid line is a linear fit to the data, yielding a slope of -dH_{c2}/dT_{c}=-0.142 T/K. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg equation H_{c2}(0)=-0.693 T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT_{c}),[37] this gives H_{c2}(0) = 0.069 T. A zero-temperature, coherence length of \xi_{\rm GL}(0) \approx 691 A is obtained using Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length formula \xi_{\rm GL}=[\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2}(0)]^{1/2}, where \Phi_{0}=2.07 \times 10^{-7} Oe cm^{2}.

### BaFeNiAs_{2}

The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility at 10 kOe for BaFeNiAs_{2} is found to increase with decreasing temperature [Fig. 6(a)]. The averaged polycrystalline magnetic susceptibility at 1.8 K is \chi=2.3 \times 10^{-3} cm^{3} mol^{-1} and at room temperature is 9.3 \times 10^{-4} cm^{3} mol^{-1}. These values are comparable to that for BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[31]

Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity gives metallic behavior for BaFeNiAs_{2} [Fig. 6(b)]. At room temperature, \rho_{ab}=0.08 m\Omega cm and \rho_{c}=2.25 m\Omega cm. The RRR is 12 along ab, but only \sim2 along c. There is no noticeable mag

For BaFeNiAs_{2} the resistivity data exhibit a quadratic temperature dependence, \rho = \rho_{o}+AT^{2}, over a wide temperature range of 1.8 to \sim68 K. The A value is a measure of the extent of electron correlations. Plotted in the inset of Fig. 6(b) is \rho(T^{2}), and linear fits in this region. For \rho_{ab}, A = 3.1\times10^{-6}\rm\frac{m\Omega}{cm} K^{-2} and it is slightly larger than that for BaCo_{2}As_{2} at 2.2 \times 10^{-6}\rm\frac{m\Omega}{cm} K^{-2},[31] consistent with the formation of a Fermi-liquid state.

Figure 6(c) gives the temperature dependence of specific heat results. For BaFeNiAs_{2}, there are no features in specific heat up to 200 K, similar to that for BaCo_{2}As_{2}. The inset of Fig. 5(b) shows C/T versus T^{2} dependence. BaFeNiAs_{2} gives a slight upturn below \sim4 K; the \gamma is remarkably similar to those for BaCo_{2}As_{2}. For BaCo_{2}As_{2}, C/T vs T^{2} is linear below \sim8 K consistent with a Fermi liquid plus phonon contribution. BaCo_{2}As_{2} gives \gamma=41.6 mJ/(K^{2} mol) [or 20.8 mJ/(K^{2} mol Co)]. For BaCo_{2}As_{2} the Wilson ratio, R_{w} = \pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}\chi^{\prime}(3/2\mu_{B}^{2}), is \sim7 from \chi_{ab} and \sim10 from \chi_{c}.[31] These values well exceed unity for a free-electron system and indicate that the system is close to ferromagnetism.

## IV Final discussions

The shrinking of the crystal lattice is observed from BaFe_{2}As_{2}, to BaFeNiAs_{2}, and finally to BaNi_{2}As_{2}. The cell volumes at room temperature are 204.567(2)A^{3}, 202.8517(3)A^{3}, and 199.7686(2)A^{3}, respectively. With cooling, BaFe_{2}As_{2} and BaNi_{2}As_{2} undergo structural transitions. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, a second-order-like transition is observed at 132(1) K, associated with a tetragonal to orthorhombic _Fnum_ distortion, and a SDW magnetic transition. In contrast to this broader transition, for BaNi_{2}As_{2} there is sharp pronounced feature at T_{0}=131 K, seen in \rho(T) and C_{p} results. This first-order transition was associated with a reduction in the lattice symmetry from tetragonal to triclinic P\overline{1}. The most interesting effect of the structural distortions in these two compounds is the resulting change in the Fe or Ni network. At room temperature the transition-metal atoms lie on a perfect square net in the ab plane of the tetragonal structure. In BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the low-temperature phase is orthorhombic and the Fe network is distorted from square to rectangular, commensurate with magnetic ordering. In BaNi_{2}As_{2}, the further reduction in symmetry below T_{0} results in a more distorted Ni network, and zigzag chains of Ni atoms. BaFeNiAs_{2} shows no evidence of structural or magnetic transitions.

The basic thermodynamic and transport properties of pure BaFe_{2}As_{2}, BaNi_{2}As_{2}, and BaNiFeAs_{2} crystals show differences between them. Unlike BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the magnetic susceptibility for BaNi_{2}As_{2} is roughly temperature independent and presents only a small anomaly at T_{0}. At room temperature, \chi_{\rm avg} (\times10^{-4}\rm\frac{cm^{3}}{mol^{-1}}) is smallest for BaNi_{2}As_{2} at 3, and slightly larger for BaFe_{2}As_{2} at 7 and largest for BaFeNiAs_{2} at 9. BaNi_{2}As_{2} is more conductive at room temperature, compared to BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The room-temperature resistivity for BaFeNiAs_{2} and BaNi_{2}As_{2} are at \sim0.08 m\Omega cm, compared to \rho_{ab}=0.50 m\Omega cm for BaFe_{2}As_{2}. At room temperature, \rho_{c}=16.44 mJ cm for BaFe_{2}As_{2}, approximately one order of magnitude larger than for BaFeNiAs_{2} and BaNi_{2}As_{2}.

Superconductivity in BaNi_{2}As_{2} is connected to pure sample and those lightly doped with Fe. The BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2} series of 0\leqx\leq0.2 gives the highest T_{c}^{\rm cea}=21 K for x =0.[38]. From temperature dependent resistivity measurements, we find no sign of superconductivity down to 0.4 K for x=0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1. The results of BaFeNiAs_{2} was given here, as a half point between BaNi_{2}As_{2} (d^{8}) and BaFe_{2}As_{2} (d^{6}). BaFeNiAs_{2} is found to show a similar magnitude of magnetic susceptibility as well as specific heat \gamma to BaCo_{2}As_{2}, which was suggested to be in a close proximity to a quantum critical point and of strong fluctuations.[31] The calculated local-density approximations show hybridization between As p states and Fe d states in BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [39]) similar to BaNi_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [40]) and BaCo_{2}As_{2}.[31] However the Fermi level for BaNi_{2}As_{2} is shifted up because of the higher valence electron count in Ni^{2+} (3d^{6}) compared to Fe^{2+} (3d^{6}). With a larger Fermi surface, BaNi_{2}As_{2} shows large Fermi surfaces and lower density of states.[13, 40] Based on band-structure calculations, the superconductivity of BaNi_{2}As_{2} appears to be rather different from BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The Ni phase can be understood within the context of conventional electron-phonon theory, while the high-T_{c} Fe superconductors cannot be described in this way.
