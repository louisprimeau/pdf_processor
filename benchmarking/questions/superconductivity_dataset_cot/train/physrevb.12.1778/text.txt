###### Abstract

Experimental results on superconducting and magnetic properties of La\({}_{3}\)In and La\({}_{3}\)Tl containing magnetic impurities are presented and discussed. From magnetic susceptibility and low-temperature specific heat we conclude that Pr\({}^{1+}\) substituted for La\({}^{1+}\) in these compounds is in a crystal-field singlet ground state; this also explains the characteristic behavior of the superconducting transition temperature as a function of the Pr concentration. The upper critical field of (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)In is limited by the mean exchange field due to the Pr ions which are polarized in the external magnetic field. At Pr concentrations higher than \(x=0.90\) the system (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)In shows a transition to a self-polarized antiferromagnetic state at low temperatures.

## I Introduction

The intermetallic compounds La\({}_{3}\)In and La\({}_{3}\)Tl are ideal host metals for the investigation of the influence of rare-earth magnetic impurities on superconducting properties. These compounds have high transition temperatures and allow a partial or complete substitution of La by another rare-earth element, and the destruction of superconductivity by such impurities can be followed over a wide range of temperature and impurity concentration. Furthermore, the electronic properties of the pure La\({}_{3}\)In and La\({}_{3}\)Tl compounds were extensively studied recently by Heiniger _et al._,[1] and it was found they belong to the class of strong-coupling superconductors showing large deviations from the BCS law of corresponding states. One of the aims of this work is to study how those thermodynamic properties, which are sensitive to strong-coupling behavior, are changed by the addition of magnetic impurities.

The influence of magnetic impurities like Gd and Ce on the properties of La\({}_{3}\)In has been investigated by several authors.[2, 3, 4, 5] However, very little is known about the influence of the crystalline electric field (CEF) on magnetic and superconducting properties of La\({}_{3}\)In and La\({}_{3}\)Tl containing non-\(S\)-state rare-earth impurities. In fact, the behavior of such alloys is expected to be very different, especially in those cases where the magnetic impurities have a singlet state as a ground state. The influence of such impurities on the critical temperature \(T_{e}\) of superconductors has been studied both experimentally[6, 7] and theoretically,[8, 9, 10] and good agreement is found in general between experiment and theory.

Recent numerical calculations of the upper critical field and of the specific heat in superconductors containing crystalline-field-split impurities by Keller and Fulde[11] have been compared with experimental data for a few alloy systems like (La\({}_{1-x}\)Tm\({}_{x}\))Sn\({}_{3}\) by Guertin _et al.[12]_ and (La\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\))Al\({}_{2}\) by Pepperl _et al.[7]_.[7] In the former case a significant difference in H\({}_{\rm eq}(T)\) is seen between (La\({}_{1-x}\)Gd\({}_{x}\))Sn\({}_{3}\), where no CEF effects are expected, and (La\({}_{1-x}\)Tm\({}_{x}\))Sn\({}_{3}\), where Tm has a nonmagnetic ground state.[6] However, it is not clear in this case how far mean-free-path effects (pure LaSn\({}_{3}\) is a type-I superconductor) and Sn precipitations are responsible for the differences between these alloys. The results for \(H_{\rm eq}\) in (La\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\))Al\({}_{2}\) on the other hand do not show a behavior as expected from theory except at the highest Tb concentrations. This, however, could be explained as being due to the mean exchange field produced by the magnetic impurities which are polarized in the external magnetic field.[7] Our new results on \(H_{\rm eq}\) in (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)In are a new test for that theory; they also have the further interest that they concern upper critical fields which are almost two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in (La\({}_{1-x}\)Tm\({}_{x}\))Sn\({}_{3}\) and (La\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\))Al\({}_{2}\).

From the theory of superconductors containing magnetic impurities one also expects in such systems large deviations from the law of corresponding states in the specific-heat discontinuity \(\Delta C\) at \(T_{e}\). Impurities with a magnetic \(S\) ground state depress \(\Delta C\) much more than \(T_{e}\).[13, 14] In the case of impurities with two singlet levels separated by the energy \(\delta\), characteristic maxima in \(\Delta C\) are expected for \(\delta\approx k_{B}T_{\rm eq}\) (\(T_{\rm eq}\) is the critical temperature of the pure superconductor), which disappear for a higher level separation.[11] Some related measurements have been published for (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))Tl by Bucher _et al.[15]_ and for (La\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\))Al\({}_{2}\) by Happel and Hoenig.[16] In both cases \(\Delta C/\Delta C_{0}\) (\(\Delta C_{0}\) is the specific-heat jump for the pure superconductor) versus \(T_{e}/T_{\rm eq}\) is higher than expected from the Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory (AG)[13, 14] for impurities with a mag  netic \(S\) ground state, thus in qualitative agreement with the theory for superconductors containing singlet-ground-state impurities. A quantitative comparison of \(\Delta C/\Delta C_{0}\) for (La1-Sr2)Ti with this theory, however, is difficult owing to the strong coupling enhancement of this quantity over the BCS value. For comparison we also give in this work the corresponding data for the (La1-Sr2)In systems stem.

After a description of the sample preparation in Sec. IIA, we present in Sec. IIB specific-heat data for (La1-Sr2)In and (La1-Sr2)Ti and deduce quantities like transition temperatures \(T_{e}\), specific-heat discontinuities \(D_{C}\) at \(T_{e}\), electronic specific heats, Debye temperatures, and for pure Pr3In the hyperfine field. Together with results of magnetic properties of (La1-Sr2)In, given in Sec. II.3, it is possible to obtain from the normal-state specific heat some information about the CEF parameters in this system. In Sec. I.4 we also present experimental data on the upper critical field _H__ed in the ternary system (La1-Sr2)In. Section III finally is devoted to a detailed discussion of the new experimental data on the basis of recent theories.

## II Experimental results

### Sample preparation

All samples prepared for this investigation were obtained by direct fusion in an argon arc furnace. As elements we used 99.999%-pure In and Tl from Asarco Co. and La from Rare Earth Products of a nominal purity of 99.99% with respect to other rare earths. Pr was zone-refined nuclear-grade material of 99.9% purity, supplied by Lunex Co. Details on the preparation and the x-ray analysis of the binary compounds La3In and La3T1, and those of the ternary alloys (La1-Sr2)Tl, can be found in earlier papers. [1,15] Alloys of the type (La1-Sr2)In were prepared in an analogous way. In a first step homogeneous La1-Sr2 alloys were formed from the elements by arc melting, and In was then added in a second step. The weight of the ingots was checked after each melting process in order to detect losses by evaporation. A slight weight loss was noticed in the second step; this, however, could be compensated by an excess of about 1% In, which we added in advance. An annealing of the La-rich (La1-Sr2)In sample was not necessary; no other phases than that with the L12 structure could be detected in these alloys, and reproducible and sharp superconducting transitions were obtained in the as-cast state.

### Specific heats in (La1-Sr2)In and (La1-Sr2)In

A large part of the data presented in this paper were obtained from low-temperature specific heats, measured in a heat-pulse calorimeter as described elsewhere. [17] Typical curves of the specific heat in superconducting alloys of the form (La1-Sr2)In and (La1-Sr2)Tl have been shown in earlier papers, [1,15] and will not be reproduced here. Instead we summarize in Table I and Figs. 1 and 2 these data by the most important parameters obtained from an analysis of the measured specific heats.

For the superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{e}\) we find a similar behavior for both systems, (La1-Sr2)In and (La1-Sr2)In, except that the transition temperatures of the latter are throughout 0.4-0.5 deg K lower. The behavior of \(T_{e}\) in these systems is typical for metals containing magnetic impurities in a crystal-field nonmagnetic ground state and will be discussed later. For comparison we also show in Fig. 3 the transition temperatures as a function of the Gd concentration in La0.175-GdIn0.25 and La0.255-GdSm0.75, where no CEF effects are expected. The results for La0.75-GdIn0.25 agree with published data [2] for low  Gd concentrations. However, we were not able to reproduce the anomalies, found by Crow and Parks[2] in this system near the critical concentration and attributed by Bennemann[18] to spin correlations among the Gd impurities. Also, \(T_{e}(x)\) for La\({}_{0.25-\text{Gd}}\)Sn\({}_{0.15}\) follows rather well the predictions of the Abrikosov-Gor'kov model,[13] if the slope of \(T_{e}(x)\) is adjusted for \(x\) = 0 (Fig. 3), and no relevant anomalies could be affirmed by these results.[10]

In Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2 we report the specific-heat jumps at \(T_{o}\), \(\Delta C/T_{o}\), for (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)In and (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)Tl. In both alloy series this quantity decreases strongly with increasing Pr concentrations for \(x\) > 0.1. At lower Pr concentrations, however, the two alloy systems behave differently, as was stated already in Ref. [15]: While \(\Delta C/T_{o}\) is almost constant in (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)Tl for 0 < \(x\) < 0.06, this quantity drops monotonically with \(d^{2}(\Delta C/T_{o})/dx^{2}\) > 0 for all Pr concentrations in (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)In. In fact one should rather compare the reduced specific-heat jumps \(\Delta C/\gamma T\), where \(\gamma\) is the coefficient of the electronic specific heat. This coefficient is not easily determined in these alloys, but it seems that it increases in both alloy systems with \(x\) and stronger in the Tl alloys than in the In alloys. If we assume a linear increase of \(\gamma\) with \(x\) for 0 < \(x\) < 0.1 in (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)Tl, we find a similar behavior of \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{o}\) vs \(x\) in both systems. Near the critical concentration \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{o}\) drops well below

  the value of 1.43 of the BCS law of corresponding states, but extrapolates to a finite value at the critical concentration. With respect to this parameter the singlet-ground-state systems thus show an intermediate behavior between BCS superconductors without magnetic impurities and gapless superconductors.

In Fig. 4 we show more in detail, for (La1+Pr)3In, the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state, \(C_{ss}\), near \(T_{e}\). Assuming that the lattice part of the specific heat is unchanged at the superconducting transition, we obtained this electronic specific-heat term \(C_{ss}\) from the total specific heat in the superconducting state, \(C_{ss}\) and the normal-state specific heat \(C_{ss}\) measured in a magnetic field of \(H\) = 10 kOe: \(C_{ss}\) = \(C_{ss}\) = \(C_{ss}\) - \(C_{ss}\) + \(\gamma T\). For comparison, Fig. 4 also shows this quantity as obtained from BCS theory.

The normal-state specific heats of the paramagnetic (La1+Pr)3In and (La1+Pr)3Tl alloys at the lowest temperatures show a standard behavior, and the analysis was done in the same way as for the binaries La3In and La3Tl, described in Ref. 1. Magnetic contributions, however, had to be considered in these ternary alloys at higher temperatures (\(T\) > 15 degK), and in the case of the Pr-rich alloys, which order magnetically, even at the lowest temperatures. Results of the analysis of the normal-state specific heats are found in Table 1 and in Figs. 2 and 5-8. Owing to the low Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}\), a reliable determination of the coefficient \(\gamma\) of the electronic specific heat was not possible without specific-heat data in a magnetic field to suppress superconductivity in (La1+Pr)3In for \(x\) < 0.2 and in (La1+Pr)3Tl for \(x\) < 0.1; \(T_{e}\) is too high in these cases to allow an extrapolation to \(T\) = 0. From alloys with a higher Pr content we observe in both alloy series a strong increase of the linear term in the specific heat. It is possible to explain this by an increase in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level by the addition of Pr to La3In and La3Tl, assuming that the Fermi level is shifted towards a peak in the electronic density of states1 if the atomic volume is reduced. We cannot, however, exclude completely any magnetic contribution responsible for an increase in the linear term of the specific heat.

At temperatures \(T\) > 15 degK the magnetic contribution of the Pr atoms to the specific heat in paramagnetic (La1+Pr)3Tl becomes predominant and can be separated from the total specific heat. This was done for (La1+Pr)3Tl in an earlier paper.[15] For the (La1+Pr)3In system we subtracted the specific heat of La3In from the measured specific heat neglecting the slight \(\gamma\) and \(\Theta_{D}(T)\) variation vs \(x\) and obtained for the magnetic part of the specific heat the results given in Fig. 6. The agreement between the results for \(x\) = 0.10 and 0.15, normalized to 1 g-at. of Pr, seems to support this procedure for the analysis of the specific heat; the slight deviations for \(x\) = 0.25 might be explained by a corresponding decrease in

  the lattice specific heat with respect to La\({}_{3}\)In. Figure 6 also shows the CEF splitting for Pr\({}^{3+}\) giving the best fit to this Schottky specific heat, and which also explains the Van Vleck paramagnetic susceptibility, as will be discussed in Sec. III.1.

In Fig. 7 we show the experimental specific heat between 1.5 and 22 degK for the binary compound Pr\({}_{3}\)In, in comparison with the same quantity found in La\({}_{3}\)In.[1] This figure shows that additional contributions are present in Pr\({}_{3}\)In. At the lowest temperatures a hyperfine field at the \({}^{141}\)Pr nuclei is at the origin of a specific-heat contribution \(C_{\rm{H}}\) = _A_/_T_3; at higher temperatures, up to the Neel point at 16, 8 degK, another magnetic contribution to the specific heat is due to antiferromagnetic ordering. Assuming that we can neglect the latter contribution below 3 degK, we analyzed the measured specific heat between 1.5 and 3 degK by a least-squares fit to the expression \(C/T\) = _A_/_T_3 + \(Y\) + _aT_2 (Fig. 8) and obtained for the coefficients \(A\) = 64 + 3 mJ degK/g-at., \(g\) = 24.3 + 1.0 mJ/degK2. g-at., and \(a\) = 0.51 + 0.20 mJ/degK2. g-at. The third term, _C_ph = _aT_3, represents mainly the phonon part of the specific heat, and we obtain from \(a\) for the Debye temperature a value of \(\Theta_{p}\) = 160 + 20 degK. If one had to consider also a spin-wave contribution, one would obtain for \(\Theta_{p}\) a somewhat higher value; a Debye temperature of 160 degK, which is comparable to that of La\({}_{3}\)In and of ternary (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))In alloys, however, seems to be reasonable, and the spin-wave contribution to the specific heat in this temperature range cannot be important. In order to clarify this point, and to estimate the magnetic contribution also between 3 degK and the Neel point, elastic constants of Pr\({}_{3}\)In should be determined. If we assume that the lattice part of the specific heat in Pr\({}_{3}\)In below 17 degK is comparable to that in La\({}_{3}\)In,[1] we obtain for the sum of the electronic and the lattice entropy of Pr\({}_{3}\)In at 16, 8 degK a value of \(S_{\rm{a1}}\) + \(S_{\rm{ph}}\) = 0.29\(R\) per g-at. Pr. We find in this way that the magnetic entropy per g-at. Pr at the Neel point \(T_{N}\) = 16.8 degK is of the order of \(S_{\rm{ma}}\) = 0.11\(R\) per g-at. Pr and much lower than the total entropy expected for Pr\({}^{3+}\) with \(J\) = 4, _S_/(g-at. Pr) = \(R\) In

### Magnetic properties of (La1-_x_Pr_x_)3 In

The magnetic susceptibility of (La1-_x_Pr_x_)3 In was measured between 1.4 and 300 degK with a pendulum magnetometer [20] in fields up to 15 kOe. In these alloys, no magnetic ordering was detected for _x_<0.35; they show, however, a strong Van Vleck paramagnetic susceptibility _x_vv, characteristic for Pr atoms in a CEF nonmagnetic ground state. As in the (La1-_x_Pr_x_)3 Tl system, 15 xvv(_T_=0) per g-at. Pr in (La1-_x_Pr_x_)In increases monotonically with \(x\) (Fig. 5). The magnetization of Pr3In and Pr-rich alloys of (La1-_x_Pr_x_)In also was investigated in low fields (~10 Oe) by a mutual-induction method at 27 Hz. [21] It shows a Curie-Weiss type behavior down to ~17 degK and a sudden decrease with temperature below a critical temperature \(T_{N}\). This behavior is typical for an antiferromagnetic ordering at the Neel temperature \(T_{N}\). Figure 5 shows \(T_{N}\) as a function of \(x\). An ordering temperature of 16.8 degK for pure Pr3In seems reasonable compared to similar compounds, but is in contradiction with earlier findings of other authors, who report ferromagnetic ordering with Curie temperatures of 62 degK, [22] and 56.5 degK, [23] respectively. Suspecting that traces of a ferromagnetic phase could have been at the origin of the observed transition near 60 degK, we also investigated the neighboring Pr3In phase and found it to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of 70 degK. [21] It is important to notice that antiferromagnetic ordering with a low Neel temperature can be inhibited by strong magnetic fields and that such ordering temperatures should be determined in low or zero magnetic fields.

### Critical fields _H__e_2(_T_) in (La1-_x_Pr_x_)3 In

Upper critical fields _H__e_2 were measured by four-probe resistance measurements on slabs of 10 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm size in a transverse magnetic field, produced by a superconducting solenoid. The temperature of the samples, which were completely submerged in liquid helium, was obtained from the helium vapor pressure. The ac resistance (100 Hz) of the samples as a function of the applied field showed a wall-defined onset at the field _H__e_2, which was inde, .ndent of the applied current. The experimental results for _H__e_2(_x_,_T_) are shown in Fig. 9; the curve for _x_=0 is in agreement with results obtained by Jones _et al._[5] In Fig. 10 we also show the upper critical field _H__e_2(0) at _T_=0, obtained from extrapolation, the slope - _dH__e_2/_dT_ at \(T_{e}\), and the ratio \(\eta = {H_{{\rm{eq}}}}(0)/{T_{{\rm{o}}}}( - {dH_{{\rm{eq}}}}/{dT})_{{\rm{r}} - {T_{{\rm{e}}}}}\) as a function of the Pr concentration.

## III Discussion

### Magnetic properties

Ternary alloys (La1-_x_Pr_x_)3 In crystallize in the Cu3Au (_L_1-type) structure; In atoms occupy the cubic sites, and La and Pr atoms are statistically distributed on the tetragonal sites. Pr atoms have

  12 nearest and equidistant neighbors; four of them are In and eight are La or Pr. The point symmetry at a Pr position is tetragonal; the deviation from a situation with cubic symmetry is due to differences in the electronic structures of In and La or Pr. At low Pr concentrations the exchange interactions can be neglected, and the \(J\) = 4 term of the Pr ion is split by a tetragonal crystalline electric field into two doublets and five singlets. It was shown recently, from inelastic neutron scattering measurements and also from specific-heat data, that the deviations from a CEF of cubic symmetry are weak in the isomorphous system (La1-Pr2)3Tl. Assuming that this is also true in (La1-Pr2)3In and neglecting sixth-order crystal-field terms, one can obtain the CEF level scheme from our data, using theoretical results from Lea, Leask, and Wolf24 for cubic symmetry. Neglecting deviations from cubic symmetry one expects, in order to explain the magnetic properties, the G istate to be lowest, followed by the G state at an energy of D above the ground state. The level difference D can be obtained from the experimental low-temperature Van Vleck crystal-field susceptibility _kh_v(0) given by

\[\chi_{\rm{vv}}(0) = 2g_{\gamma}^{2}\mu_{B}^{2}\alpha^{2}/\Delta\;,\]

with \(\alpha = \langle\Gamma_{1}|\hat{J}|\Gamma_{\nu}\rangle = (\frac{\pi}{2})^{1/2}\). In the limit of \(x\) - 0 we found experimentally _kh_v(0) = 0.040 cm3/(g-at. Pr) (Fig. 5), which would lead to D_k_B_ = 82 degK. However, in order to explain the Schottky anomaly in the specific heat we would have to assume a D_k_B_ of about 119 degK. This discrepancy may be due in part to magnetic impurities other than Pr or to a self-polarizability of the singlet-state ion. The most obvious explanation, however, is given by the fact that slight deviations of the CEF from cubic symmetry influence differently _kh_v(0) and the Schottky specific heat. For a "weakly tetragonal" crystalline electric field the levels of Pr3+ are split as shown in Fig. 6. The specific-heat anomaly is determined in this case by the centers of gravity of the Pr levels and therefore insensitive to a tetragonal distortion. The Van Vleck susceptibility, on the other hand, is determined by the singlet state derived from the cubic G triplet. It is therefore possible to explain the experimental data correctly by the level scheme, shown in Fig. 6, for tetragonal symmetry, from which we obtain the correct value for _kh_v(0) and a good fit to the experimental specific heat (Fig. 6).

In Fig. 5 we notice that the Van Vleck susceptibility per Pr atom is not constant but increases with increasing Pr concentration. Such a behavior was found already in the (La1-Pr2)3Tl system and could be explained at least qualitatively by an increase of the exchange interaction which finally leads to ferromagnetism for overcritical exchange.16 In the (La1-Pr2)3In system, however, the effective exchange interaction between Pr ions leads to antiferromagnetism at high Pr concentrations, and one would expect, on the basis of a simple molecular-field model, rather a decrease of the low-field susceptibility as was found, e. g., in (Y-Tb)Sb by Cooper and Vogt.25 On the other hand, no systematic variation of the Schottky specific heat was found as a function of \(x\) and no lowering of the G cEF level can be invoked in order to explain this increase of the Van Vleck susceptibility with \(x\). In a single-atom picture, both the increase of _kh_v(0) and the constancy of the Schottky anomaly could be explained by an increasing tetragonal distortion of the crystalline electric field. It is probable, however, that sign and magnitude of the effective exchange interaction between Pr ions depends critically on the concentration-dependent Pr nearest-neighbor configuration and on changes of the electronic structure with \(x\). It is therefore possible that such effects are not only at the origin of the enhancement of _kh_v(0) in (La1-Pr2)3In, but also of the differences between Pr2Tl (ferromagnetic19) and Pr2In (antiferromagnetic) and of the deviations of the experimental Van Vleck susceptibility in (La1-Pr2)3Tl from a behavior as expected from a molecular-field theory.15

At high concentrations of Pr, for \(x\) > 0.90, (La1-Pr2)3In shows a transition from the Van Vleck paramagnetic state to an antiferromagnetic state. The Neel temperature \(T_{N}\) increases monotonically with \(x\) from \(T_{N}\) = 0 at the critical concentration _x_er 0.90 to the value of \(T_{N}\) = 16.8 degK at \(x\) = 1.0. (La1-Pr2)3In is one of the few alloy systems where the exchange interaction changes with composition from an undercritical value to an overcritical value. Magnetic properties of such systems depend mainly on two interactions: (a) the interaction of the rare-earth ions with their surrounding CEF and (b) the exchange interaction between the rare-earth ions via the conduction electrons. If the exchange interaction is weak enough, it is possible for non-Kramers ions (_J_ integer) that the CEF produces a crystal-field singlet ground state, leading to a Van Vleck paramagnetism down to the lowest temperatures (undercritical exchange). This is the case for (La1-Pr2)3In with \(x\) < 0.90. If the exchange interaction exceeds a certain value (critical exchange) the singlet ground state mixes spontaneously with higher-lying crystal-field states to produce a lower-lying polarized ground state. Magnetic ordering here does not occur through the usual process of alignment of permanent magnetic moments but rather through a polarization of the Pr _4f_ states by the exchange interaction.

A characteric behavior of induced-moment systems with low ordering temperatures is that little  entropy change is caused by magnetic ordering. In fact, the total magnetic entropy for magnetic ions is _S_max = \(R\) ln(2\(J\) + 1); however, if all excited levels in the paramagnetic state lie considerably higher than _k_B_T_order most of this entropy is given up by the system of magnetic ions upon cooling down to the ordering temperature _T_order. For Pr3In we can estimate the magnetic entropy left at the Neel temperature \(T_{N}\) = 16.8 degK if we assume that the level scheme of Pr ions above \(T_{N}\) is the same as in La-rich (La1a7Pr3)In alloys. Neglecting any many-body effects in the paramagnetic region we obtain for the entropy at \(T_{N}\)

\[\begin{equation*}S(T_{N})=\int_{0}^{T_{N}}(C_{{\mathrm{mag}}}/T)\,dT\\ \cong R\,\left(1+\frac{\Delta}{k_{B}T_{N}}\right)e^{-\Delta/k_{B}T_{N}}\,,\end{equation*}\]

where D is the energy of the first excited level as measured from the ground-state level. For D/_k__B_ = 82 degK we obtain _S_(\(T_{N}\)) = 0.045R or 1.5% of the total magnetic entropy for Pr3+ with \(J\) = 4. This is about half of our estimation from the experimental specific heat. However, neither the analysis of the experimental specific heat is very reliable nor can the assumption of a level separation of D/_k__B_ = 82 degK obtained for dilute alloys be verified, and the agreement seems therefore satisfactory. In any case, these estimations show that one has to expect in such systems, where D/_k__B_T_order3  1, small specific-heat anomalies connected with magnetic ordering.

As another characteristic of induced-moment systems, magnetic ions usually show a reduced magnetic moment. Pr3In being antiferromagnetic, it is not possible to determine the magnetic moments of the Pr ions by a simple measurement of the macroscopic spontaneous moment. No neutron-diffraction data exist for this compound up to now. An estimation of the magnetic moment of Pr in Pr3In, however, can be obtained from its hyperfine specific heat. Neglecting quadrupole interactions, and for _k_B_T_  _m__H_M, this specific-heat contribution _C_M_M is given at high \(T\) by

\[\begin{equation*}C_{{\mathrm{hf}}}=A/T^{2}\\ =cR\,\frac{I+1}{3I}\left(\frac{\mu_{{\mathrm{f}}}H_{{\mathrm{hf}}}}{k_{B}T} \right)^{2}\,,\end{equation*}\]

with \(c\) = 0.75 (concentration of 141Pr in Pr3In), \(I\) = \(\frac{n}{2}\) (nuclear spin of 141Pr), \(m_{t}\) = 4.28 \(m_{H}\) (nuclear magnetic moment of 141Pr in nuclear magnetons \(m_{H}\)), and _H_M is the hyperfine field. From \(A\) = 64 +- 3 mJ *K/g-at. we obtain _H_M = (0.92 +- 0.02) \(\times 10^{6}\) Oe. This hyperfine field is related to the electronic magnetic moment <_m__H_> (_e_ axis taken parallel to the mean magnetic moment) through the magnetic hyperfine constant \(a_{J}\):

\[\begin{equation*}-\mu_{{\mathrm{f}}}H_{{\mathrm{hf}}}=a_{{\mathrm{f}}}\langle J_{{\mathrm{z}}}\rangle I_{{\mathrm{z}}}\,,\end{equation*}\]

\[\begin{equation*}\langle\mu_{{\mathrm{z}}}\rangle=g_{{\mathrm{f}}}\mu_{{\mathrm{z}}}\langle J_{{\mathrm{z}}}\rangle=-g_{{\mathrm{f}}}\mu_{{\mathrm{z  ternal field as well as the scattering by nonmagnetic and magnetic impurities and by the spin-orbit interaction. Also, this theory has been extended by Fischer [31] in order to take into account the mean exchange field and possible compensation effects due to magnetic impurities aligned by an external magnetic field or by the exchange interaction. In the case of non-\(S\)-state magnetic ions one also has to consider the influence of the crystalline electric field. Theoretical [8, 9, 10, 11] and experimental [12, 16, 7, 13] investigations in recent years have shown that CEF can strongly influence the behavior of \(T_{o}\) vs the concentration of non-Kramers ions, and, to a lesser extent, the behavior of \(H_{eq}\) and the specific heat in the superconducting state.

Owing to inelastic scattering processes, magnetic impurities with a singlet ground state assert a pair-breaking effect on the Cooper pairs, and it was shown by Fulde _et al._[9] that the effect of such processes can be of the same order of magnitude as that of elastic scattering processes by impurities with a magnetic ground state, even in cases where the energy separation \(\Delta\) of the first excited state from the ground state is considerably larger than \(k_{B}T\). The physical reason why the dependence of \(T_{o}\) upon the impurity concentration strongly depends on the CEF level scheme can be understood from an approximate relation for the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{o}\), valid in the dirty limit for not too high concentrations of magnetic impurities:

\[\ln\left(\frac{1}{t_{o}}\right)=\psi\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\rho(c,t_{o})}{2t _{o}}\right)-\psi(\frac{1}{2})\ ,\] (5)

where \(\psi(\varepsilon)\) is the digamma function, \(t_{o}\!=\!T_{o}/T_{o\!o}\) and where the pair-breaking parameter \(\rho(c,t_{o})\) for zero magnetic field is given by the relation

\[\rho(c,t_{o})=\lambda_{m}\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad  \[f(\delta_{1}/t_{e}\,T_{e0}) = \frac{1}{g\pi}\left| \left\langle 0\left| \vec{J} \right|1\right\rangle \right|^{2}\  and (La1-Ce2)3In5; at present, no theory exists which takes into account such effects in strong-coupling superconductors. For these reasons, the following discussion can only be qualitative.

In the following estimation we show that the effect of the mean exchange field \(H_{g}\) is not negligible in high-field superconductors containing singlet-ground-state impurities. In the case of (La1-Pr2)3In the mean exchange field is given by

\[H_{g} = \frac{\left. \left. \left. \left. \left. \left(G_{0}\right)\left[\left.

  but remains above the AG curve. It was shown recently that in strong-coupling superconductors quantities like \(\Delta C\) critically depend on the phonon spectra, if the phonon frequencies are measured with respect to \(T_{eq}\), and that the depression of \(T_{eq}\) influences in a complicated way \(\Delta C/T_{eq}\).[29] We therefore believe that the dependence of \(\Delta C/T_{eq}\) in (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)In and (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)Tl on the Pr concentration is essentially determined by strong-coupling effects and not by the crystalline electric field.

## IV Conclusions

(a) (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)In and (La\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{3}\)Tl show a transition from a Van Vleck paramagnetic state at low Pr concentration to an ordered induced-moment state at high Pr concentrations.

(b) In Pr\({}_{3}\)In the induced magnetic order is antiferromagnetic with a Neel temperature of \(T_{N}\) = 16.8 degK, compared to Pr\({}_{3}\)Tl showing an induced ferromagnetism below the Curie temperature of \(T_{f}\)=11.3 degK.
