###### Abstract

The pressure dependence of the phase-transition temperatures for oxygenated La2CuO4.035 single crystals was investigated in the pressure range <14 kbar. Three successive phase transitions, one at 295 K with second-order character, one around 265 K with martensitic-transition character, and the other around 222 K with first-order character, were found to be suppressed under pressure. The pressure coefficient of the superconducting temperature dT_{c}/dp turned from -0.5 to +0.7 K/kbar when the three successive phase transitions were suppressed by pressure.

The phase transitions and phase transformations in oxygenated La2CuO4.035 single crystals was investigated in the pressure range <14 kbar. Three successive phase transitions, one at 295 K with second-order character, one around 265 K with martensitic-transition character, and the other around 222 K with first-order character, were found to be suppressed under pressure. The pressure coefficient of the superconducting temperature dT_{c}/dp turned from -0.5 to +0.7 K/kbar when the three successive phase transitions were suppressed by pressure.

 iodometry and the composition was found to be La2CuO4.035. Measurements of resistance were carried out along both the a and c axes of the crystal with a cooling and heating rate of 0.6 K/min. Since the size of the single crystal used for the resistance measurement was too small to calculate the exact resistivity, we did not transform the raw resistance data to the resistivity. Maximum pressure applied for the sample was 18 kbar at room temperature and the pressure was monitored by the change in the resistance of the manganese wire. Resistance measurements were carried out for pressures 0.0, 1.3, 3.0, 4.7, 6.6, 8.3, and 11.0 kbar at 273 K and 0.0, 3.8, 6.6, 11.1, and 13.1 kbar around T_{e}. The pressure loss for the employed high pressure vessel with the temperature decrease from room temperature to helium temperature was about 4 kbar. Details of the experimental procedure for high pressure are given in our previous paper.14,15

Figure 1 shows the pressure dependence of the resistance along the a and c axes above 180 K. As found in our previous reports,11,12 three successive phase transitions are observable at 295, 250-270, and below 222 K at ambient pressure. The value in the figure show the pressures at 273 K. The inset in Fig. 1(b) shows the pressure change with temperature. The temperature of the second-order transition at 295 K first increases up to 305 K with increasing pressure then vanishes. The temperature of the martensitic transition around 250-270 K increases with pressure then vanishes. Although the resistance change corresponding to the first-order transition at 222 K is not so clear compared to other two phase transitions, very small slope change and temperature hysteresis loop could be observed in the temperature range 222 and 190 K. This phase transition disappears at pressures greater than 8 kbar. Figure 2 shows the variation of superconducting transition temperature with pressure. The pressure dependence of T_{e} changes from -0.5 to +0.7 K/kbar at the pressure of 4 kbar which corresponds to the pressure 8 kbar at 273 K. The rise in the transition temperatures for two successive phase transitions above 250 K and their disappearance at higher pressure may be interpreted as follows. As mentioned above, all three phase transitions above 200 K have the displacive character, i.e., accompanying no diffusion or migration of oxygen ions. We should assume that the disproportionation of the sample into excess-oxygen-rich and excess-oxygen-poor regions would occur between the temperatures of the I4/_mmm-Bmab_ transition and 320 K, which was the maximum temperature of our heat-capacity measurement.11 The nature of the second-order transition at 295 K is not clear at all since the structured change and thermal anomaly are very small. When this phase transition disappears with increasing pressure, metallic conductivity appears at all temperatures above 200 K. Since we cannot detect the phase transition in the resistivity along the a axis at 295 K, this second-order transition induces a two-dimensional character although the mechanism of the transition is completely obscure. The martensitic phase transition synchronously disappears as well as the second-order transition when the pressure increases. This phase transition is observed along both a and c axes. According to the neutron diffraction data,10 reflection lines of (006), (014), and (100) show the changes in both integrated intensity and line width at 260 K. These changes have been interpreted as due to the phase separation into oxygen-rich _Bmab_ phase and nearly stoichiometric antiferromagnetic _Bmab_ phase or due to the effect of small domain. The change or jump in lattice parameter along the c axis is most prominent around 260 K. If we accept their second view for the

  neutron diffraction data, i.e., the formation of a small domain in the crystal below 260 K, the formation might be attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion of Cu^{2+} ions along the c axis due to the localization of holes with decreasing temperature in the oxygen-poor region. Since such a phase transition is considered to produce the interfacial energy between the mother and daughter phases and proceed fairly fast, martensitic character may be observed, i.e., the transition proceeds in a short time to a certain quasi equilibrium state. Application of the external pressure enhances the phase transition temperatures as shown in Fig. 1. This implies that the external stress works to cancel the internal stress induced by the transition. Figure 3 shows the pressure dependence of the martensitic transition temperature determined for the resistive change with temperature along the c axis. This figure clearly shows that martensitic transition temperature disappears at 8 kbar. Therefore, 8 kbar and 273 K are the critical pressure and temperature where the deformation stress of the mother phase becomes equal to the stress required to induce the transition. Above this temperature under 8 kbar, the mother phase would suffer from elastic deformation before the external stress induces the transition.

Comparing the results in Figs. 1 and 2, we can recognize the close relation between the sign of dTc/dp versus phase transitions above 200 K. When three phase transitions remain under pressure (p<8 kbar at 273 K), negative pressure dependence appears. On the contrary, when these phase transitions disappear (p>8 kbar) positive temperature dependence appears. Therefore, we can conclude here that application of pressure plays the same role as electrochemical oxidation and annealing at 200 K, which enhances the superconductivity transition temperature up to 40 K.

In conclusion, the effect of application of isostatic pressure on the resistance of La_{2}CuO_{4.035} single crystal is prominent in the phase transitions above 200 K. At a pressure greater than 8 kbar, phase transitions above 200 K disappear. When the sample experiences these phase transitions at higher temperatures, it shows pressure dependence of T_{c}, dT_{c}/dp=-0.5 K/kbar. On the contrary, when the sample does not experience these phase transitions at higher temperature, it shows a positive temperature dependence of +0.7 K/kbar. Using the compressibility data for La_{2}CuO_{4},[16] the volume change due to a compression up to 10 kbar is about 0.7%. This small volume decrease with pressure would be effective for the displacive phase transition at T>200 K. Pressure dependence of T_{c} may reflect the effects not only the external pressure but also the internal pressure required for the displacive transition at high temperature, especially the martensitic phase transition at 265 K. Recently, we have investigated the electrical properties of electrochemically oxidized single crystalline, La_{2}CuO_{4+8} and found that phase transitions above 200 K are clearly depressed with increasing \delta.[17] The small dT_{c}/dp for the electrochemically oxidized La_{2}CuO_{4+8} (Ref. 18) and La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} (Ref. 19) may imply that the T_{c} under pressure may saturate in the higher pressure region p>15 kbar. Inelastic neutron scattering experiment for the single crystalline La_{2}CuO_{4+8} may elucidate the mechanism of phase transition.
