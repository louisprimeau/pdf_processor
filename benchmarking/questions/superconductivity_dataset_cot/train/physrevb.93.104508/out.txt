###### Abstract

The superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} of ammoniated metal-doped FeSe (NH3)3,M_{\rm r}FeSe (M: metal atom) has been scaled with the FeSe plane spacing, and it has been suggested that the FeSe plane spacing depends on the location of metal atoms in (NH3)3,M_{\rm r}FeSe crystals. Although the crystal structure of (NH3)3,Li,FeSe exhibiting a high T_{\rm c} (\sim44 K) was determined from neutron diffraction, the structure of (NH3)3,M_{\rm r}FeSe exhibiting a low T_{\rm c} (\sim32 K) has not been determined thus far. Here, we determined the crystal structure of (NH3)3,Cs0,FeSe (T_{\rm c} = 33 K) through the Rietveld refinement of the x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern measured with synchrotron radiation at 30 K. The XRD pattern was analyzed based on two different models, on-center and off-center, under a space group of 14/mmm. In the on-center structure, the Cs occupies the 2a site and the N of NH3 may occupy either the 4c or 2b site, or both. In the off-center structure, the Cs may occupy either the 4c or 2b site, or both, while the N occupies the 2a site. Only an on-center structure model in which the Cs occupies the 2a and the N of NH3 occupies the 4c site provided reasonable results in the Rietveld analysis. Consequently, we concluded that (NH3)3,Cs0,FeSe can be assigned to the on-center structure, which produces a smaller FeSe plane spacing leading to the lower T_{\rm c}.

2016 201 and the N of NH3 occupied the 4c site. The chemical composition was determined to be (NH3)0.37(4)Cs0.268/4 FeSe. In the analysis, a deficiency of Fe was not observed. Furthermore, we investigated the x dependence of _T_c in (NH3)3CsFeSe and discussed the constant _T_c value observed from view of the structure.

## II Experimental

The \beta-FeSe sample was prepared using the annealing method described in Ref. [11]. The sample of (NH3)3CsFeSe was synthesized using the liquid-NH3 technique described in Ref. [11] with a nominal x = 0.4. The experimental procedure is the same as that in our previous reports [2,11]. The dc magnetic susceptibilities _M_/_H_'s, of all samples were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2); here, M and H refer to the magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. The _M_/_H_ in this paper corresponds to the mass magnetic susceptibility (cm3 g-1 = emu g-1). The XRD pattern of the sample was measured with synchrotron radiation (wavelength \lambda = 0.400176(2) A) in BL02B2 of SPring-8, Japan. The sample was introduced into a quartz tube and a capillary for _M_/_H_ measurement and XRD, respectively, in an Ar-filled glove box (H2O, O2 < 0.1 ppm); the capillary was filled with He gas. Le Bail and Rietveld refinements were performed using the GSAS program.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility (_M_/_H_ in cm3 g-1) at zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) for the (NH3)3Cs0.4FeSe sample. The onset superconducting transition temperature (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}}) and _T_c were determined to be 35 and 33.5 K, respectively, from the _M_/_H_ - T plots. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a), the _T_c is determined from the cross point of the drop of _M_/_H_ and the extrapolation of the normal state. The shielding fraction of the sample was 25% at 10 K. The _M_/_H_ - T plots suggest the presence of pure \beta-FeSe, which exhibits a _T_c as high as 8 K.

Figure 1(b) shows the XRD patterns measured at different temperatures. These patterns suggest that the crystal structure is the same in the entire temperature range, i.e., no structural phase transition occurs. The Le Bail fitting of the XRD pattern at 30 K is shown in Fig. 1(c). The Le Bail fitting was achieved assuming the presence of three different crystal phases: (NH3)3CsFeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe. The XRD pattern consists of the overlapped peaks from three phases, but some peaks can be assigned to only a single phase among three phases, indicating the presence of three phases. Thus,

  the XRD pattern could be well analyzed considering the above three phases.

We determined the lattice constants for these crystal phases based on previous reports; the space groups for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe were I4/mmm (#139) [5,10,11,14], P4/mmm (#129) [11,18,19], and P6_{3}/mmc (#94) [11,20], respectively. The lattice constants a and c were determined to be 3.8082(2) and 16.097(1) A, respectively, for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, 3.7739(3) and 5.4417(9) A for \beta-FeSe, and 3.6166(1) and 5.9233(4) A for \alpha-FeSe, respectively.

Figure 1(d) shows the temperature dependence of the a and c of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe. The a and c at 300 K for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe were determined to be 3.8272(2) and 16.243(1) A, respectively, which are the same as those, 3.8331(1) and 16.217(1) A, determined previously by our group [11]. The ratio of lattice constants at 8 K with respect to those at 300 K, a(8 K)/a(300 K) and c(8 K)/c(300 K), were 0.994 and 0.989, respectively, suggesting a slightly larger thermal shrinkage along the c direction consisting of van der Waals interaction between FeSe layers.

Next, we discuss the Rietveld analysis of the XRD pattern of the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe sample at 30 K. The strategy for the Rietveld analysis is schematically shown in Fig. 2. To investigate the validity of the models, the Rietveld analyses were performed using two models (on-center and off-center). In the analysis, the three phases, (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe, were included, in the same manner as in the Le Bail fitting [Fig. 1(c)], and the space groups of I4/mmm, P4/mmm, and P6_{3}/mmc were adopted, respectively. In all analyses, the structures of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe were taken from previous reports [11,18,19,20]. The Fe and Se of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe were located at the 4d and 4e sites, respectively, which are the same as their location in non-ammoniated K_{x}FeSe [5].

As shown in Fig. 2, in the off-center model, the Cs atoms in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe are located at the 4c (0, 1/2, 0) and 2b (0, 0, 1/2) sites, and the N of NH_{3} was located at the 2a site (0, 0, 0); the structure is the same as that of (NH_{3})_{x}Li_{x}FeSe [10]. The H atom was not included in the analysis throughout this study. The occupancy of Cs and N were refined, while the occupancy of Fe and Se were fixed to 1.0. The Debye-Waller factor B (B=8\pi^{2}U, U: isotropic thermal-displacement of atom) for all atoms (Fe, Se, Cs, and N) were refined in the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase, and z at the 4e site (Se) were refined. The refinements of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe were performed together with that of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe. In \beta-FeSe, the Fe and Se atoms were located at 2a (3/4, 1/4, 0) and 2c (1/4, 1/4, z) sites (choice \#2 of P4/mmm), respectively, and the z at the 2c site and B values at both sites were refined; occupancies at both sites were fixed to 1.0. In \alpha-FeSe, the Fe and Se atoms were located at the 2a (0, 0, 0) and 2c (1/3, 2/3, 1/4) sites, respectively, and the B values at both sites were refined. The lattice constants of three phases were refined together with background and peak-shape (profile-function) parameters; CW profile function 2 of the GSAS program was used for the profile function. This function employs a multiterm Simpson's rule integration of the pseudo-Voigt function [21]. The parameters of profile functions are refined independently for each phase.

In the refinement with the off-center model described above, the fractions of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe were evaluated to be 37, 33, and 30%, respectively. The a and c of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe were determined to be 3.8050(3) and 16.066(2) A, respectively, which are almost the same as those, 3.8082(2) and 16.097(1) A, evaluated from the Le Bail fitting [Fig. 1(c)]. However, the B of the Cs at the 4c site rapidly increased to 63(12) A^{2}, while the B of the Cs at the 2b site had a negative value. Furthermore, the occupancy of N diverged. As a reference, the XRD pattern calculated based on the off-center structure of the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase and the structures of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe is shown in Fig. 3(a), together with the experimental XRD pattern; the weighted R factor (wR_{\rm p}) and pattern R factor (R_{\rm p}) were 11.3 and 7.7%, respectively. From the unreasonable B factors and occupancy, we must conclude that this refinement is not successful, showing that the off-center model cannot be applied for the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase. The logarithmic scale of the experimental XRD pattern is shown together with the logarithmic-scaled pattern calculated (off-center model) in Fig. 3(b), to clearly show the entire XRD pattern.

As shown in Fig. 2, we subsequently analyzed the XRD pattern based on the on-center model (space group: I4/mmm) for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe. In the same manner as the analysis based on the off-center model for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe were included in the analysis. The structures of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe are the same as those used in the off-center structure analysis. The lattice constants of three phases were refined together with the background, and the parameters of the profile function were independently refined for each phase; the profile function is the same as that in the off-center model.

In the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase, the Cs atom was located at the 2a (0, 0, 0) site, while the N atom of NH_{3} was located at the 2b (0, 0, 1/2) site. The occupancy of Cs and N were refined, while the occupancy of Fe and Se were fixed to 1.0. The B values for all elements and z at the 4e site were refined in the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase. The Rietveld refinement showed a negative occupancy and negative B for the N atom (2b site), indicating that this structure (on-center model) can also be ruled out for the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase.

Figure 2: Process of Rietveld refinement for the XRD pattern measured at 30 K for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe.

  Next, in the on-center model, the N atom was moved to the 4c\,(0,1/2,0) site from the 2b site. The occupancy of Cs and N, B values of all elements, and z of the 4e site were refined in this analysis. This analysis successfully provided reasonable values for occupancy, B, and z, as listed in Table 1. The a and c for (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe were 3.8075(2) and 16.048(2) A, respectively, which are the same as those [3.8082(2) and 16.097(1) A] at 30 K obtained using Le Bail fitting [Fig. 1(d)]. The refined structures of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe are also reasonable (see Table 1). Consequently, the on-center structure in which the Cs occupies the 2a site and the N occupies the 4c site was identified for (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe. From the determined occupancies of N and Cs, the chemical stoichiometry was evaluated to be (NH_{3})_{\rm{0.37(4)}}Cs_{\rm{0.268(4)}}FeSe. The x value [0.268(4)] determined from the occupancy of Cs at the 2a site was consistent with that [x=0.255(5)] reported previously for the other batch of (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe (nominal x=0.4) [11] and was almost consistent with the nominal x value (=0.4), indicating a reliable occupancy. However, it should be recognized that the occupancy is evaluated under the restriction of I4/mmm symmetry.

The fractions of (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe were 36, 34, and 32%, respectively. The w\,R_{\rm{p}} and R_{\rm{p}} were 10.7 and 7.1%, respectively, indicating a better analysis with the on-center model than the off-center model. The calculated XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 3(c), together with the experimental XRD pattern, and the logarithmic scale of the experimental XRD pattern is shown together with the calculated pattern in Fig. 3(d), to clearly show the entire experimental and calculated XRD patterns.

To confirm the on-center structure (Cs: 2a site, N: 4c site), the N atom was assumed at both the 2b and 4c sites, and refinement was performed. Consequently, the occupancy for the N at the 2b site vanished, and that for the N at the 4c site had the same value as that in the analysis based on the on-center model (Cs: 2a site, N: 4c site) described above. The B values of N at the 2b and 4c sites provided negative and reasonable values, respectively. These results imply that the N does not exist at the 2b site; rather, it exists at the 4c site. Thus, our analysis of the XRD pattern of the (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe sample successfully resulted in the on-center structure (Cs: 2a site, N: 4c site) for the (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe

  phase. The structure suggested for (NH3)3,FeSe is shown in Fig. 4(a). Here, we must comment that the fraction of 36% determined from the Rietveld refinement is a little different from the shielding fraction (\sim25%) from the magnetic susceptibility. Such a deviation is also found in the previous report [11]. One possibility for the lower volume fraction (\sim25%) determined from magnetic susceptibility is that the presence of nonsuperconducting/magnetic \alpha-FeSe may suppress the superconducting state. At the present stage, the origin remains to be clarified.

We attempted to determine the occupancy of Fe in the (NH3)3,FeSe phase. In the final structure [Table 1 and Fig. 4(a)], only the occupancy and B of Fe (4d site) were refined to determine the deficiency of Fe, providing the chemical stoichiometry of (NH3)3,FeSe. This implies the absence of a deficiency of Fe in (NH3)3,FeSe, which is reasonable from the low paramagnetic susceptibility observed in the normal state [Fig. 1(a)]. Finally, we calculated the difference Fourier map using the on-center model structure (Cs: 2a site, N: 4c site), which refers to electron density distribution evaluated from the difference between the XRD observed and that calculated with the on-center model. No electron densities were observed at the 2a and 4c sites, showing clearly that the above on-center model is reasonable. In addition, the electron density was observed at the 2a site in the difference Fourier map when the N atom was located at the 2a site (off-center model), indicating the electrons are inefficient, i.e., the element is not N but Cs at 2a site. This supports the validity of the on-center model.

We tried to determine the anisotropic thermal displacements _U_ij's for Fe, Se, Cs, and N. However, the anisotropic thermal parameters could not be shown since complete analyses have not been achieved, probably because of an insufficient data quality. Nevertheless, if we shortly comment, the anisotropic parameters U11, U22, and U33 of N and Cs became negative in the off-center model, while those were positive in the on-center model, indicating that the on-center model is suitable.

Furthermore, we evaluated the particle size from 002 reflection, which refers to the particle size along the c axis. The particle size along the a axis could not be obtained because all peaks ascribable to h 00 reflection were overlapped from peaks due to other indices. Therefore, we could not compare the particle size between the a and c axes. The particle size (=27 nm) along the c axis seems to be a little small, but it is still unclear whether the small particle size originates from the 2D of (NH3)3,CsFeSe.

The present structure analysis for (NH3)3,FeSe and the previous one for (NH3)3,LiFeSe using neutron diffraction [10] show that the positions of the metal atom and N atom are different between Cs and Li. The c, 16.5266(9) A, of (ND2.8(1)0.5Li0.305)FeSe (off-center structure) [10] is larger than that, 16.243(1) A, of (NH3)0.37(4)Cs0.20684)FeSe (on-center structure) determined using Le Bail fitting at 300 K, indicating that the off-center structure leads to an increased FeSe plane spacing, which produces higher _Tc_ because of the increase in the 2D. Table 2 lists the interatomic distances determined with the on-center and off-center models. The interatomic distances can be compared with those in (NH3)3,Li3,FeSe and K3FeSe reported previously [5, 10]. The interatomic distances determined from the off-center model are consistent with those of the previous report on (NH3)3,Li3,FeSe (off-center structure) [5]. On the other hand, the interatomic distances in the on-center model could not be compared directly with those of other (NH3)3,_M_x FeSe having on-center structure because of no data, but as seen from Table 2, the Fe-Se and M-Se distances are consistent with those of non-ammoniated K3FeSe (on-center structure), indicating that the analysis based on the on-center model is reliable.

Here, it is worth noting that the limited x in (NH3)3,_M_x FeSe is 0.5 for the on-center structure since the M occupies the 2a site, while it increases to 1.5 for the off-center structure since the M can occupy the 2b and 4c sites. Since the x in (NH3)3,CsFeSe and (NH3)3,Li3FeSe, as described above, is less than 0.5, they can have both the on-center and

4c N  off-center structures. Actually, depending on the ionic radius, the structure adopted seems to be different. Our recent paper showed that (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe has two superconducting phases (T_{\rm c} = 32 K and 46 K [17]) depending on the x value, and the phases have different c values [14.145(8) A for the 32 K phase and 17.565(7) A for the 46 K phase]. A value of x greater than 0.5 produces the high-T_{\rm c} phase, presumably owing to the off-center structure, which is reasonable because a value of x greater than 0.5 is not allowed for the on-center structure. Furthermore, our paper showed that (NH_{3})_{y}Li_{x}FeSe possessed only a single superconducting phase when varying x[17]. Therefore, the x dependence of T_{\rm c} in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe is of interest because it would directly relate to whether the position of the Cs atom varies with x.

The x dependence of T_{\rm c} showed that the T_{\rm c} did not change when varying the nominal x value from 0.0 to 1.3 [Fig. 4(b)], and it was constant at 33\pm 2 K. This indicates that only an on-center structure is adopted in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe, and the Cs amount intercalated in the FeSe lattice may be x\leqslant 0.5 despite varying the x value. Only a single phase (T_{\rm c}\sim 33K) was realized in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, which is different from (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe and (NH_{3})_{x}Li_{x}FeSe, indicating the ionic radius of the intercalant is a key for determining the T_{\rm c}, i.e., the larger ionic radius leads to the lower T_{\rm c}.

## IV Conclusions

The Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe was successfully achieved, and it revealed an on-center structure in which the Cs and the N of NH_{3} occupy the 2a and 4c sites, respectively. This suggests that the low-T_{\rm c} phase (T_{\rm c}\sim 32 K) found in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{x}FeSe takes the on-center structure, while the high-T_{\rm c} phase (T_{\rm c}\sim 45 K) takes the off-center structure, as determined for (NH_{3})_{y}Li_{x}FeSe [10]. The on-center structure has a smaller FeSe plane spacing than that of the off-center structure, and the FeSe plane spacing closely relates to the T_{\rm c}. This paper clarified not only the structural difference between the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{x}FeSe, but also the effect of the location of the metal and NH_{3} atoms on the FeSe plane spacing (or T_{\rm c}). As the location of metal atoms with relatively large and small ionic radii (Cs and Li) was determined, the next target for determination must be FeSe materials incorporating a metal atom with intermediate ionic radius such as Na, which produces multiple superconducting phases (high-T_{\rm c} and low-T_{\rm c} phases [12, 17]). This paper constitutes a step towards clarifying the correlation between the crystal structure and T_{\rm c} in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{x}FeSe.

###### Abstract

The superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} of ammoniated metal-doped FeSe (NH3)3,M_{\rm r}FeSe (M: metal atom) has been scaled with the FeSe plane spacing, and it has been suggested that the FeSe plane spacing depends on the location of metal atoms in (NH3)3,M_{\rm r}FeSe crystals. Although the crystal structure of (NH3)3,Li,FeSe exhibiting a high T_{\rm c} (\sim44 K) was determined from neutron diffraction, the structure of (NH3)3,M_{\rm r}FeSe exhibiting a low T_{\rm c} (\sim32 K) has not been determined thus far. Here, we determined the crystal structure of (NH3)3,Cs0,FeSe (T_{\rm c} = 33 K) through the Rietveld refinement of the x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern measured with synchrotron radiation at 30 K. The XRD pattern was analyzed based on two different models, on-center and off-center, under a space group of 14/mmm. In the on-center structure, the Cs occupies the 2a site and the N of NH3 may occupy either the 4c or 2b site, or both. In the off-center structure, the Cs may occupy either the 4c or 2b site, or both, while the N occupies the 2a site. Only an on-center structure model in which the Cs occupies the 2a and the N of NH3 occupies the 4c site provided reasonable results in the Rietveld analysis. Consequently, we concluded that (NH3)3,Cs0,FeSe can be assigned to the on-center structure, which produces a smaller FeSe plane spacing leading to the lower T_{\rm c}.

2016 201 and the N of NH3 occupied the 4c site. The chemical composition was determined to be (NH3)0.37(4)Cs0.268/4 FeSe. In the analysis, a deficiency of Fe was not observed. Furthermore, we investigated the x dependence of _T_c in (NH3)3CsFeSe and discussed the constant _T_c value observed from view of the structure.

## II Experimental

The \beta-FeSe sample was prepared using the annealing method described in Ref. [11]. The sample of (NH3)3CsFeSe was synthesized using the liquid-NH3 technique described in Ref. [11] with a nominal x = 0.4. The experimental procedure is the same as that in our previous reports [2,11]. The dc magnetic susceptibilities _M_/_H_'s, of all samples were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2); here, M and H refer to the magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. The _M_/_H_ in this paper corresponds to the mass magnetic susceptibility (cm3 g-1 = emu g-1). The XRD pattern of the sample was measured with synchrotron radiation (wavelength \lambda = 0.400176(2) A) in BL02B2 of SPring-8, Japan. The sample was introduced into a quartz tube and a capillary for _M_/_H_ measurement and XRD, respectively, in an Ar-filled glove box (H2O, O2 < 0.1 ppm); the capillary was filled with He gas. Le Bail and Rietveld refinements were performed using the GSAS program.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility (_M_/_H_ in cm3 g-1) at zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) for the (NH3)3Cs0.4FeSe sample. The onset superconducting transition temperature (T_{\text{c}}^{\text{onset}}) and _T_c were determined to be 35 and 33.5 K, respectively, from the _M_/_H_ - T plots. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a), the _T_c is determined from the cross point of the drop of _M_/_H_ and the extrapolation of the normal state. The shielding fraction of the sample was 25% at 10 K. The _M_/_H_ - T plots suggest the presence of pure \beta-FeSe, which exhibits a _T_c as high as 8 K.

Figure 1(b) shows the XRD patterns measured at different temperatures. These patterns suggest that the crystal structure is the same in the entire temperature range, i.e., no structural phase transition occurs. The Le Bail fitting of the XRD pattern at 30 K is shown in Fig. 1(c). The Le Bail fitting was achieved assuming the presence of three different crystal phases: (NH3)3CsFeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe. The XRD pattern consists of the overlapped peaks from three phases, but some peaks can be assigned to only a single phase among three phases, indicating the presence of three phases. Thus,

The difference between the Le Bail fitting and experimental XRD is indicated in blue. (d) Lattice constants a and c are plotted as a function of T.

  the XRD pattern could be well analyzed considering the above three phases.

We determined the lattice constants for these crystal phases based on previous reports; the space groups for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe were I4/mmm (#139) [5,10,11,14], P4/mmm (#129) [11,18,19], and P6_{3}/mmc (#94) [11,20], respectively. The lattice constants a and c were determined to be 3.8082(2) and 16.097(1) A, respectively, for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, 3.7739(3) and 5.4417(9) A for \beta-FeSe, and 3.6166(1) and 5.9233(4) A for \alpha-FeSe, respectively.

Figure 1(d) shows the temperature dependence of the a and c of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe. The a and c at 300 K for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe were determined to be 3.8272(2) and 16.243(1) A, respectively, which are the same as those, 3.8331(1) and 16.217(1) A, determined previously by our group [11]. The ratio of lattice constants at 8 K with respect to those at 300 K, a(8 K)/a(300 K) and c(8 K)/c(300 K), were 0.994 and 0.989, respectively, suggesting a slightly larger thermal shrinkage along the c direction consisting of van der Waals interaction between FeSe layers.

Next, we discuss the Rietveld analysis of the XRD pattern of the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe sample at 30 K. The strategy for the Rietveld analysis is schematically shown in Fig. 2. To investigate the validity of the models, the Rietveld analyses were performed using two models (on-center and off-center). In the analysis, the three phases, (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe, were included, in the same manner as in the Le Bail fitting [Fig. 1(c)], and the space groups of I4/mmm, P4/mmm, and P6_{3}/mmc were adopted, respectively. In all analyses, the structures of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe were taken from previous reports [11,18,19,20]. The Fe and Se of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe were located at the 4d and 4e sites, respectively, which are the same as their location in non-ammoniated K_{x}FeSe [5].

As shown in Fig. 2, in the off-center model, the Cs atoms in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe are located at the 4c (0, 1/2, 0) and 2b (0, 0, 1/2) sites, and the N of NH_{3} was located at the 2a site (0, 0, 0); the structure is the same as that of (NH_{3})_{x}Li_{x}FeSe [10]. The H atom was not included in the analysis throughout this study. The occupancy of Cs and N were refined, while the occupancy of Fe and Se were fixed to 1.0. The Debye-Waller factor B (B=8\pi^{2}U, U: isotropic thermal-displacement of atom) for all atoms (Fe, Se, Cs, and N) were refined in the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase, and z at the 4e site (Se) were refined. The refinements of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe were performed together with that of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe. In \beta-FeSe, the Fe and Se atoms were located at 2a (3/4, 1/4, 0) and 2c (1/4, 1/4, z) sites (choice \#2 of P4/mmm), respectively, and the z at the 2c site and B values at both sites were refined; occupancies at both sites were fixed to 1.0. In \alpha-FeSe, the Fe and Se atoms were located at the 2a (0, 0, 0) and 2c (1/3, 2/3, 1/4) sites, respectively, and the B values at both sites were refined. The lattice constants of three phases were refined together with background and peak-shape (profile-function) parameters; CW profile function 2 of the GSAS program was used for the profile function. This function employs a multiterm Simpson's rule integration of the pseudo-Voigt function [21]. The parameters of profile functions are refined independently for each phase.

In the refinement with the off-center model described above, the fractions of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe were evaluated to be 37, 33, and 30%, respectively. The a and c of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe were determined to be 3.8050(3) and 16.066(2) A, respectively, which are almost the same as those, 3.8082(2) and 16.097(1) A, evaluated from the Le Bail fitting [Fig. 1(c)]. However, the B of the Cs at the 4c site rapidly increased to 63(12) A^{2}, while the B of the Cs at the 2b site had a negative value. Furthermore, the occupancy of N diverged. As a reference, the XRD pattern calculated based on the off-center structure of the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase and the structures of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe is shown in Fig. 3(a), together with the experimental XRD pattern; the weighted R factor (wR_{\rm p}) and pattern R factor (R_{\rm p}) were 11.3 and 7.7%, respectively. From the unreasonable B factors and occupancy, we must conclude that this refinement is not successful, showing that the off-center model cannot be applied for the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase. The logarithmic scale of the experimental XRD pattern is shown together with the logarithmic-scaled pattern calculated (off-center model) in Fig. 3(b), to clearly show the entire XRD pattern.

As shown in Fig. 2, we subsequently analyzed the XRD pattern based on the on-center model (space group: I4/mmm) for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe. In the same manner as the analysis based on the off-center model for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe were included in the analysis. The structures of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe are the same as those used in the off-center structure analysis. The lattice constants of three phases were refined together with the background, and the parameters of the profile function were independently refined for each phase; the profile function is the same as that in the off-center model.

In the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase, the Cs atom was located at the 2a (0, 0, 0) site, while the N atom of NH_{3} was located at the 2b (0, 0, 1/2) site. The occupancy of Cs and N were refined, while the occupancy of Fe and Se were fixed to 1.0. The B values for all elements and z at the 4e site were refined in the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase. The Rietveld refinement showed a negative occupancy and negative B for the N atom (2b site), indicating that this structure (on-center model) can also be ruled out for the (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe phase.

Figure 2: Process of Rietveld refinement for the XRD pattern measured at 30 K for (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe.

  Next, in the on-center model, the N atom was moved to the 4c\,(0,1/2,0) site from the 2b site. The occupancy of Cs and N, B values of all elements, and z of the 4e site were refined in this analysis. This analysis successfully provided reasonable values for occupancy, B, and z, as listed in Table 1. The a and c for (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe were 3.8075(2) and 16.048(2) A, respectively, which are the same as those [3.8082(2) and 16.097(1) A] at 30 K obtained using Le Bail fitting [Fig. 1(d)]. The refined structures of \beta-FeSe and \alpha-FeSe are also reasonable (see Table 1). Consequently, the on-center structure in which the Cs occupies the 2a site and the N occupies the 4c site was identified for (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe. From the determined occupancies of N and Cs, the chemical stoichiometry was evaluated to be (NH_{3})_{\rm{0.37(4)}}Cs_{\rm{0.268(4)}}FeSe. The x value [0.268(4)] determined from the occupancy of Cs at the 2a site was consistent with that [x=0.255(5)] reported previously for the other batch of (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe (nominal x=0.4) [11] and was almost consistent with the nominal x value (=0.4), indicating a reliable occupancy. However, it should be recognized that the occupancy is evaluated under the restriction of I4/mmm symmetry.

The fractions of (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe, \beta-FeSe, and \alpha-FeSe were 36, 34, and 32%, respectively. The w\,R_{\rm{p}} and R_{\rm{p}} were 10.7 and 7.1%, respectively, indicating a better analysis with the on-center model than the off-center model. The calculated XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 3(c), together with the experimental XRD pattern, and the logarithmic scale of the experimental XRD pattern is shown together with the calculated pattern in Fig. 3(d), to clearly show the entire experimental and calculated XRD patterns.

To confirm the on-center structure (Cs: 2a site, N: 4c site), the N atom was assumed at both the 2b and 4c sites, and refinement was performed. Consequently, the occupancy for the N at the 2b site vanished, and that for the N at the 4c site had the same value as that in the analysis based on the on-center model (Cs: 2a site, N: 4c site) described above. The B values of N at the 2b and 4c sites provided negative and reasonable values, respectively. These results imply that the N does not exist at the 2b site; rather, it exists at the 4c site. Thus, our analysis of the XRD pattern of the (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{0.4}}FeSe sample successfully resulted in the on-center structure (Cs: 2a site, N: 4c site) for the (NH_{3})_{\rm{y}}Cs_{\rm{x}}FeSe

  phase. The structure suggested for (NH3)3,FeSe is shown in Fig. 4(a). Here, we must comment that the fraction of 36% determined from the Rietveld refinement is a little different from the shielding fraction (\sim25%) from the magnetic susceptibility. Such a deviation is also found in the previous report [11]. One possibility for the lower volume fraction (\sim25%) determined from magnetic susceptibility is that the presence of nonsuperconducting/magnetic \alpha-FeSe may suppress the superconducting state. At the present stage, the origin remains to be clarified.

We attempted to determine the occupancy of Fe in the (NH3)3,FeSe phase. In the final structure [Table 1 and Fig. 4(a)], only the occupancy and B of Fe (4d site) were refined to determine the deficiency of Fe, providing the chemical stoichiometry of (NH3)3,FeSe. This implies the absence of a deficiency of Fe in (NH3)3,FeSe, which is reasonable from the low paramagnetic susceptibility observed in the normal state [Fig. 1(a)]. Finally, we calculated the difference Fourier map using the on-center model structure (Cs: 2a site, N: 4c site), which refers to electron density distribution evaluated from the difference between the XRD observed and that calculated with the on-center model. No electron densities were observed at the 2a and 4c sites, showing clearly that the above on-center model is reasonable. In addition, the electron density was observed at the 2a site in the difference Fourier map when the N atom was located at the 2a site (off-center model), indicating the electrons are inefficient, i.e., the element is not N but Cs at 2a site. This supports the validity of the on-center model.

We tried to determine the anisotropic thermal displacements _U_ij's for Fe, Se, Cs, and N. However, the anisotropic thermal parameters could not be shown since complete analyses have not been achieved, probably because of an insufficient data quality. Nevertheless, if we shortly comment, the anisotropic parameters U11, U22, and U33 of N and Cs became negative in the off-center model, while those were positive in the on-center model, indicating that the on-center model is suitable.

Furthermore, we evaluated the particle size from 002 reflection, which refers to the particle size along the c axis. The particle size along the a axis could not be obtained because all peaks ascribable to h 00 reflection were overlapped from peaks due to other indices. Therefore, we could not compare the particle size between the a and c axes. The particle size (=27 nm) along the c axis seems to be a little small, but it is still unclear whether the small particle size originates from the 2D of (NH3)3,CsFeSe.

The present structure analysis for (NH3)3,FeSe and the previous one for (NH3)3,LiFeSe using neutron diffraction [10] show that the positions of the metal atom and N atom are different between Cs and Li. The c, 16.5266(9) A, of (ND2.8(1)0.5Li0.305)FeSe (off-center structure) [10] is larger than that, 16.243(1) A, of (NH3)0.37(4)Cs0.20684)FeSe (on-center structure) determined using Le Bail fitting at 300 K, indicating that the off-center structure leads to an increased FeSe plane spacing, which produces higher _Tc_ because of the increase in the 2D. Table 2 lists the interatomic distances determined with the on-center and off-center models. The interatomic distances can be compared with those in (NH3)3,Li3,FeSe and K3FeSe reported previously [5, 10]. The interatomic distances determined from the off-center model are consistent with those of the previous report on (NH3)3,Li3,FeSe (off-center structure) [5]. On the other hand, the interatomic distances in the on-center model could not be compared directly with those of other (NH3)3,_M_x FeSe having on-center structure because of no data, but as seen from Table 2, the Fe-Se and M-Se distances are consistent with those of non-ammoniated K3FeSe (on-center structure), indicating that the analysis based on the on-center model is reliable.

Here, it is worth noting that the limited x in (NH3)3,_M_x FeSe is 0.5 for the on-center structure since the M occupies the 2a site, while it increases to 1.5 for the off-center structure since the M can occupy the 2b and 4c sites. Since the x in (NH3)3,CsFeSe and (NH3)3,Li3FeSe, as described above, is less than 0.5, they can have both the on-center and

4c N  off-center structures. Actually, depending on the ionic radius, the structure adopted seems to be different. Our recent paper showed that (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe has two superconducting phases (T_{\rm c} = 32 K and 46 K [17]) depending on the x value, and the phases have different c values [14.145(8) A for the 32 K phase and 17.565(7) A for the 46 K phase]. A value of x greater than 0.5 produces the high-T_{\rm c} phase, presumably owing to the off-center structure, which is reasonable because a value of x greater than 0.5 is not allowed for the on-center structure. Furthermore, our paper showed that (NH_{3})_{y}Li_{x}FeSe possessed only a single superconducting phase when varying x[17]. Therefore, the x dependence of T_{\rm c} in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe is of interest because it would directly relate to whether the position of the Cs atom varies with x.

The x dependence of T_{\rm c} showed that the T_{\rm c} did not change when varying the nominal x value from 0.0 to 1.3 [Fig. 4(b)], and it was constant at 33\pm 2 K. This indicates that only an on-center structure is adopted in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe, and the Cs amount intercalated in the FeSe lattice may be x\leqslant 0.5 despite varying the x value. Only a single phase (T_{\rm c}\sim 33K) was realized in (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{x}FeSe, which is different from (NH_{3})_{y}Na_{x}FeSe and (NH_{3})_{x}Li_{x}FeSe, indicating the ionic radius of the intercalant is a key for determining the T_{\rm c}, i.e., the larger ionic radius leads to the lower T_{\rm c}.

## IV Conclusions

The Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern of (NH_{3})_{y}Cs_{0.4}FeSe was successfully achieved, and it revealed an on-center structure in which the Cs and the N of NH_{3} occupy the 2a and 4c sites, respectively. This suggests that the low-T_{\rm c} phase (T_{\rm c}\sim 32 K) found in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{x}FeSe takes the on-center structure, while the high-T_{\rm c} phase (T_{\rm c}\sim 45 K) takes the off-center structure, as determined for (NH_{3})_{y}Li_{x}FeSe [10]. The on-center structure has a smaller FeSe plane spacing than that of the off-center structure, and the FeSe plane spacing closely relates to the T_{\rm c}. This paper clarified not only the structural difference between the low-T_{\rm c} and high-T_{\rm c} phases in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{x}FeSe, but also the effect of the location of the metal and NH_{3} atoms on the FeSe plane spacing (or T_{\rm c}). As the location of metal atoms with relatively large and small ionic radii (Cs and Li) was determined, the next target for determination must be FeSe materials incorporating a metal atom with intermediate ionic radius such as Na, which produces multiple superconducting phases (high-T_{\rm c} and low-T_{\rm c} phases [12, 17]). This paper constitutes a step towards clarifying the correlation between the crystal structure and T_{\rm c} in (NH_{3})_{y}M_{x}FeSe.
