###### Abstract

We have studied magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of
Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ and its solid solution with the T_(c) ≃ 13 K
superconductor La3Ni2B2N3-_d_. The solid solution (La,Ce)Ni2B2N3-_d_
reveals a rapid reduction of T_(c) by increasing the Ce content with a
complete suppression of superconductivity at the composition
La2.5KCe101Si2B2N3-_d_. The low-temperature properties characterize
CeNi2B2N3-_d_ as an intermediate valence system with a moderately
enhanced Sommerfeld value γ ≃ 54 mJ/mol K2 and a susceptibility
χ₀ ≃ 1.6 × 10⁻³ emu/mol, increased by about one order of magnitude as
compared to the respective value χ₀ ≃ 0.2 × 10⁻³ emu/mol of
superconducting La3Ni2B2N3-_d_ (γ = 26 mJ/mol K2) which serves as
reference with a nonmagnetic rare earth ion. The electrical resistivity
and thermoelectric power of Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ are analyzed in terms of the
degenerate Anderson lattice model revealing a characteristic Kondo
temperature $T_{K}^{\rm{K}}$ ∼ 1100 K.

## I Introduction

The persistent interest in intermetallic compounds containing cerium is
due to their rich low-temperature physics interrelated with ground
states such as the Kondo lattice with and without long-range magnetic
order, intermediate valence, Kondo insulator, and in some cases
unconventional superconductivity (see, e.g., Ref. [1] for a recent
review). This variety of ground states adopted in cerium compounds is a
consequence of competing interactions: RKKY-type Ce-Ce intersite
exchange, crystal field effects, and Kondo interaction between Ce 4f and
conduction electrons. A subtle balance between RKKY and Kondo
interactions in some cases leads to the formation of novel ground states
of correlated electrons such as magnetically mediated unconventional
superconductivity. Cerium based superconductors at ambient pressure are,
e.g., CeCu2Si2, Ce_T_In5, and non-centrosymmetric CePtSi. [2, 3, 4] From
the earliest studies of magnetic pair breaking effects in rare earth
elements by Matthias _et al._[5] cerium has been known to act as a
strongly pair breaking impurity in a superconducting matrix.

A prominent system among intermetallics showing interplay of magnetism
and superconductivity is the quaternary borocarbide, _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ =
rare earths and Y), with relatively high T_(c) (up to 16 K; see, e.g.,
Refs. [6] and [7]). In the corresponding solid solution with cerium,
Y1-_x_CeNi2B2C, a complete suppression of superconductivity was observed
at x ≥ 0.25. [8] Studies of structural and magnetic features of CeNi2B2C
revealed intermediate valence of Ce and absence of superconductivity
down to 2 K. [9, 10] Interestingly, El-Massalami _et al._[11] reported
conventional BCS type superconductivity for CeNi2B2C at temperatures
below T_(c) ≃ 100 mK. The related quaternary boronitride,
La3Ni2B2N3-_d_, with rocksalt type triple LaN layer sheets in between
the NiB layers shows superconductivity with T_(c) ∼ 12-15 K. [12, 13,
14] A cerium based homologue, Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_, was synthesized as powder
material via a metathesis reaction by Glaser _et al._[16] Magnetic
susceptibility measurements down to 5 K revealed neither
superconductivity nor magnetic ordering. [16]

In this paper we investigate the ground state properties of bulk
metallic samples of (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ by means of x-ray diffraction,
susceptibility, specific heat, and transport measurements.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline samples of (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ were prepared by
inductive levitation melting in a three step process. In the first step,
stoichiometric amounts of Ni and B were melted several times in Ar
atmosphere. In a second step, La and Ce metals were premelted in vacuum
and then melted with NiB forming (La,Ce)3Ni2B2 precursor alloys. In a
third step these alloys were repeatedly melted in Ar/N2 atmosphere such
that the N-stoichiometry is slowly increased to reach a composition
close to a nominal stoichiometry (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N-_d_. The latter was
determined by measuring the mass gain after each melting cycle and by
measuring the pressure drop within the recipient. The
(La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ alloys were flipped after each melting cycle to
improve their homogeneity. The samples were finally annealed in a
high-vacuum furnace at 1100 degC for 1 week. The starting materials were
La and Ce ingot (Metall Rare Earth, 99.9

The phase purity of the samples was checked by powder x-ray diffraction
(XRD) on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using monochromated Cu Kα
radiation. Full profile Rietveld refinements were carried out using the
fullprof program. [18] Magnetic measurements were performed on a
CRYOGENIC SQUID magnetometer (3 K to room temperature) and on a Quantum
Design 9 T vibrating sample magnetometer (VMS) equipped with a VSM oven
operating up to 1000 K. Resistivity measurements were carried out on bar
shaped samples with a standard four probe method in a 4He cryostat (4 -
400 K) and for Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ additionally in a 3He cryostat down to 350
mK. Specific heat measurements were made on 2-3 g samples employing an
adiabatic step heating technique. Measurements of the thermoelectric
power (TEP) were carried out from 4 K to 300 K with a so-called
differential seesaw heating method in a ⁴He cryostat and
high-temperature measurements (340-800 K) were carried out on an ULVAC
ZEM-3 measuring system.

## III Results and discussion

### Structural characterization

Powder XRD data of all samples of the series La33-xCe_(x)Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ)
display the body centered tetragonal La3Ni₂B₂N₃ type structure with
space group I4/mmm. Except for Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ), some minor admixtures
of the related two-layer boronitride (La,Ce)NiBN are identified with
phase fractions of up to 5

The variation of the lattice parameters a and c in the solid solution
La3-xCe_(x)Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) is summarized in Fig. 2. The lattice
parameters a and c obtained for Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) are 0.357 nm and 2.025
nm, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the lattice
parameters reported earlier.[16] The reduction of the unit cell volume
of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) as compared to La3Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) is about 9

### Superconductivity in La3-xCe_(x)Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ)

The superconducting transition temperatures of La3-xCe_(x)Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ)
with x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1 were determined from dc susceptibility
measurements (see Fig. 3) which were performed after zero field cooling
(ZFC) at a field of 1 mT. Field-cooled susceptibility (not shown for the
sake of clarity in Fig. 3) reveal Meissner fractions

### Ground state properties of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ)

#### 3.3.1 Results of thermodynamic and transport studies

The ground state properties of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) were studied by means
of specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and
thermoelectric power measurements. The normal state properties of
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) with an empty 4f shell are used as a reference for
non-4f contributions. The specific heat of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) measured at
zero external field and the normal state specific heat of
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) measured at 9 T are shown in Fig. 4 as C_(p)/T vs T.
The low-temperature electronic and lattice contributions of a plain
metal are given by $C_{p}=C_{e}+C_{\rm ph}\simeq\gamma+\beta T^{3}$
where γ is the Sommerfeld value and β is related to the low-temperature
Debye temperature $\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}=(1944\times n/\beta)^{1/3}$,
where n = 10 is number of atoms per formula unit. From the
low-temperature fit of the Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) data (see inset in Fig. 4)
we obtain γ ≃ 54 mJ/mol K² and β ≃ 0.36 mJ/mol K⁴ corresponding to
$\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}=378$ K. The latter, however, might be misleading
because the C ∝ βT³ lattice term is superimposed by magnetic
contributions from Ce 4f orbitals. In the case of La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) the
low-temperature data yield γ ≃ 26 mJ/mol K² and
$\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\simeq 329$ K which are in agreement with the values
reported in Ref. [19], γ ≃ 26 mJ/mol K² and
$\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\simeq 303$ K. The enhanced electronic contribution
to the specific heat of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) as compared to
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ), i.e., Δγ ≃ 28 mJ/K²mol, is attributed to magnetic
contributions of Ce-4f in the intermediate valent regime.

The dc magnetic susceptibilities of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) and
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) were measured from 3 K to room temperature (RT) and
from RT to 1000 K at applied fields of 1 T and 9 T, respectively [see
Fig. 5 (a)]. While La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) displays (above its T_(c)) a
simple, weakly temperature dependent Pauli paramagnetism with a
low-temperature susceptibility, χ₀ ≃ 0.2 × 10⁻³ emu/mol,
Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) exhibits about an order of magnitude larger
susceptibility with a maximum at about 800 K. For both compounds, a
small additional Curie-Weiss component is observed at low temperatures
and a corresponding fit of the data from 10 to 200 K in terms of a
temperature-independent component χ₀ plus a Curie-Weiss term
χ = χ₀ + C/(T − θ) where C the Curie constant and θ the paramagnetic
Curie temperature yielding for Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) a χ₀ ≃ 1.6 × 10⁻³
emu/mol and C ≃ 9 × 10⁻³ emu K/mol. In the case of La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) the
fit of the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility data gives
χ₀ ≃ 0.2 × 10⁻³ emu/mol and C ≃ 4 × 10⁻³ emu K/mol. The paramagnetic
Curie temperature for both the samples is of the order of −10 K. The
Curie-Weiss-like contribution in Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) is attributed to
paramagnetic impurities (e.g., Gd traces of the order of 100 ppm in the
La and Ce raw elements) and seems to be not an intrinsic property. The
values of χ₀ and C obtained for La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) are close to values
reported earlier.[21]

The moderately temperature dependent but nevertheless largely enhanced
susceptibility of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) is attributed to f-electron
contributions from intermediate valent Ce ions with strongly Kondo
screened Ce 4f moments. In

order to obtain a measure for the 4f occupation from the susceptibility
data we follow the approach proposed in Refs. [22, 23, 24]. Comparison
of the Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ)4f susceptibility (obtained by subtracting the
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) data) with the theoretical susceptibility of Ce³⁺ ions
(4f¹ configuration with a ground state total angular momentum J = 5/2
and excited state J = 7/2 separated by a spin-orbit splitting Δ ≃ 3150
K; see, e.g., Ref. [26]) in a χ T versus T plot in Fig. 5 (b) suggests a
4f occupation clearly larger than 0.7. We note that the
temperature-dependent susceptibility χ(T) of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) in Fig.
5(a) compares rather well with, e.g., χ(T) of CeIr₂ showing just
slightly lower absolute values as compared to Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) and a
weak maximum at a slightly higher temperature ∼1000 K.[23] The values of
χ T(1000 K) are 0.63 emu K/mol-Ce and ∼0.55 emu K/mol-Ce for
Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) and CeIr₂, respectively. For CeIr₂ a cerium valence of
3.2 -3.23 has been reported from $L_{\rm III}$ x-ray absorption
studies.[24, 25] Thus, a realistic estimate for the 4f occupation of
Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) is near 0.8.

The 4f contribution to the low-temperature susceptibility
Δχ(0) ≃ 1.4 × 10⁻³ emu/mol and the Sommerfeld value Δγ ≃ 28 mJ/K²mol is
analyzed in terms of the Fermi-liquid relation (see, e.g., Ref. [27]),

Rg_(J)²J(J + 1)μ_(B)²Δγ = π²k_(B)²Δχ,
(1)

yielding for J = 5/2 an experimental value of the Wilson ratio R ≃ 1.8
being slightly larger than the value expected for a degenerate
Ce^(−3.2+) state.[28, 29]R = N/[N − 1 + (n_(f) − 1)²] ≃ 1.19 for a
degeneracy N = 6 and n_(f) = 0.8.

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity ρ(T) of
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) and Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) is shown in Fig. 6. Except for
small variations of the residual resistivities, absolute values of ρ(T)
obtained in this study have been well reproduced with several samples of
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ)[14] and Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ). The superconducting
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) has a T_(c)^(ρ) ≃ 12.5 K while Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ)
remains in the normal state at least down to the base temperature of the
experiment, i.e., 0.35 K. At temperatures below 30 K, the ρ(T) vs T²
graph of the experimental data shown as an inset in Fig. 3 reveals a
quadratic temperature dependence ρ(T) = ρ₀ + AT², with A ≃ 1.2 × 10⁻⁹Ω
cm/K². This coefficient A yields a Kadowaki-Woods ratio
A/γ² ≃ 4 × 10⁻⁶μΩ cm (K mol-Ce/mJ)² which is in between the typical
Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/γ² ∼ 10⁻⁵μΩ cm (K mol-Ce/mJ)² of (mostly twofold
degenerate) cerium Kondo-lattice systems and the expected generalized
Kadowaki-Woods ratio of Kondo lattice systems with sixfold degenerate
Ce-4f moments[30] yielding A/γ² ∼ 0.7 × 10⁻⁶μΩ cm (mol K/mJ)².

The value of the coefficient A together with the Sommerfeld coefficient
of the electronic specific heat is indicative of Kondo interaction in
Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) with a relatively high Kondo temperature as compared
to typical crystal field splittings of the J = 5/2 multiplet of the Ce
4f¹ state. Accordingly, numerical results of a sixfold degenerate
Anderson lattice model (ALM) without Ce-Ce intersite coupling compiled
by Cox and Grewe[31] are used to analyze the resistivity and
thermoelectric power [ALM model provides $S(T>0.2T_{K}^{\rm ALM})$; see
below] of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ). In the simple fully degenerate case, i.e.,
for strong Kondo coupling as compared to the crystal field splitting,
the ALM yields a universal temperature dependency for the magnetic
contribution to the resistivity and also the TEP, which simply scale
with the Kondo temperature $T_{K}^{\rm ALM}$.

according to the ALM and the dashed line shows the normal metal
$\rho_{0}+\rho_{\rm BG}$ contribution included in this fit. Inset: ρ vs
T² graph of the Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) data.

To analyze the temperature-dependent resistivity data of
Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) a magnetic contribution according to the numerical ALM
results, $\rho_{\rm ALM}(T/T_{K}^{\rm ALM})$, is combined with a
Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model for the normal metal phonon contribution
yielding

$$\rho(T) = \rho_{0}+\alpha\,\rho_{\rm ALM}\big{(}T/T_{K}^{\rm ALM}\big{)}$$
(2)
$$+\frac{4B}{\Theta_{D}}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)^{5}\int_{ 0}^{\Theta_{D}/T}\frac{z^{5}dz}{(e^{z}-1)(1-e^{-z})}.$$

A reasonable set of parameters (further corroborated by the analysis of
the thermoelectric power discussed below) is ρ₀ = 17.6μΩ cm [essentially
fixed by ρ(T → 0) data], α = 89.6μΩ cm, $T_{K}^{\rm ALM}=1100$ K
(characteristic Kondo temperature of the ALM model), the electron-phonon
coupling constant B = 0.013Ω cm K, and Debye temperature Θ_(D)^(ρ) = 262
K of the Bloch-Gruneisen model. The resulting fit is indicated as solid
line in Fig. 6. The resulting normal metal contribution, i.e., residual
resistivity ρ₀ plus phonon contribution according to the Bloch-Gruneisen
fit, is in remarkably close agreement with the resistivity data of
La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) (in absolute values). The characteristic energy scale
$T_{K}^{\rm ALM}=1100$ K is in fair agreement with the magnitude
indicated by the maximum in the susceptibility near 800 K.

The temperature-dependent thermopower S(T) of La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) and
Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) is shown in Fig. 7(b). For La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ), S(T) is
negative above T_(c) indicating a positive slope of the electronic
density of states near the Fermi level. The mismatch between T < 300 K
and T > 300 K data is an artifact of having used two different measuring
techniques with imperfect overlap. The dashed-dotted line in Fig. 7(b)
indicates a linear high-temperature extrapolation of the T < 300 K
measurement corresponding to S(T) = a + bT with a = −16.7 nV/K and
b = −1.77μV/K².

The TEP for Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) exhibits a sharp linear increase at low
temperature with an initial slope S/T ≃ 0.2μV/K and a broad Kondo
maximum at high temperature with $S_{\rm max}\simeq 26\mu$V/K at about
500 K. The latter is analyzed in terms of the ALM data by Cox and Grewe
[31] using the characteristic Kondo temperature T_(K) = 1100 K derived
above. When comparing the TEP of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) with the _clean
limit_ ALM calculation for sixfold degenerate Ce⁻³⁺ which yields a broad
maximum $S_{\rm max}=103$μV/K at T/T_(K) ≃ 0.6 (see Fig. 3 of Ref.
[31]), it is necessary to consider in addition to Kondo scattering, at
least, also defect and phonon scattering. The summation of different
contributions to the TEP is highly nontrivial, in particular for a
quaternary, layered compound such as Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) with a complex
multiband Fermi surface where in addition to contributions due to
different scattering mechanisms, also contributions of different bands
(index j) are to be added via the relation S = ∑_(j)S^(j)σ^(j)/σ with
σ^(j) being the electrical conductivity of band j (see, e.g., Ref.
[32]). The consideration of specific bands, however, looses relevance at
elevated temperatures where interband scattering becomes strong. Thus,
at high enough temperatures an estimate for the total diffusion
thermopower S due to different types of scattering mechanisms α, e.g.,
electron-defect (S_(e, 0)), electron-electron (S_(e, e) or in the case
of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) the Kondo contribution $S_{\rm ALM}$ according to
the ALM), and electron-phonon ($S_{\rm ep}$) scattering, is obtained via
the Kohler relation,[33]

S = W⁻¹∑_(α)S_(α)W_(α),
(3)

with W being the electronic thermal resistance. The latter obeys the
Matthiessen rule, W = ∑_(α)W_(α), where W_(α) are the contributions due
to particular scattering mechanisms α. For simplicity of the analysis,
W_(α) is estimated via the Wiedemann-Franz law,
W_(α)(T) = ρ_(α)(T)/L_(α)T, assuming
$L_{e,0}\approx L_{\rm ep}\approx L_{e,e}\approx L_{0}=2.44\times 10^{-8}$
WΩ/K² (L₀ is the Lorenz-number) where Eq. (3) conforms to the
Northheim-Gorter rule. Accordingly, contributions $W_{\rm ALM}$,
$W_{0}+W_{\rm BG}$, and the total electronic thermal resistance
$W_{\rm total}$ corresponding to the above analysis of the resistivity
data are displayed in Fig. 7(a). An estimate for the contribution
$S_{e,0}+S_{\rm ep}$ is obtained from the La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) reference
data [see the dashed-dotted line in Fig. 7(b)]. The latter together with
the Kondo contribution $S_{\rm ALM}$ are added according to the Kohler
relation, thus yielding a total TEP based on the degenerate ALM with
T_(K) = 1100 K as indicated by the solid line in Fig. 7(b), which is in
reasonable agreement with the experimental data.

The Kohler relation is not applicable in the low-temperature limit where
many strongly correlated electron systems exhibit an approximately
linear temperature dependence of the TEP which hardly depends on the
level of elastic defect scattering

(corresponding to the residual resistivity ρ₀). Rather, the Seebeck
coefficient S is related to the Sommerfeld coefficient γ,

$$\frac{S}{T}=q\frac{\gamma}{N_{A}e},$$
(4)

where N_(A) is Avogadro’s number and q is a dimensionless quantity which
is found to be close to unity for most of the Ce based compounds.[34]
For γ ≃ 18 mJ/K²mol-Ce, the slope of the low-temperature part of the
thermopower of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N³ ⁻ ⁴ [dashed line in Fig. 7(b)] yields
S/T ≃ 0.2μV/K² revealing q ≃ 1, well in line with the empirical trend
observed for a large number of Ce based compounds compiled by Behnia _et
al_. in Ref. [34]. It is important to note that the T-linear TEP, and
thus the phenomenological relation, Eq. (4), conforms with the Boltzmann
picture of the free electron gas (see, e.g., Ref. [34]), as well as with
_clean limit ALM_ results (see, e.g., Ref. [31]). The prominent
shoulder-like feature of S(T) of Ce₃Ni₂B₂N³ ⁻ ⁴ visible in Fig. 7(b) at
about 20-150 K, thus, results from a crossover between the S ∝ γ T
low-temperature regime and the high-temperature regime where different
types of scattering mechanisms contribute to the the total diffusion
thermopower as conceived by the Kohler relation. Accordingly, the
shoulder-like feature of S(T) does not relate to an energy scale of
Kondo or valence fluctuations which should have an appropriate
correspondence in specific heat and susceptibility data.

## Conclusions

Powder XRD confirms the existence of a solid solution
La_(3 − x)Ce_(x)Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) from x = 0 − 3 with the La₃Ni₂B₂N₃ type
structure and space group I4/mmm whereby the lattice parameter a follows
the lanthanide contraction, i.e., decreases with increasing Ce-fraction,
but the lattice parameter c shows a nonmonotonic variation with a
maximum at low Ce fraction (x ∼ 0.2). With respect to superconductivity
of the parent compound La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ), which is observed below
T_(c) ≃ 13 K in the present study, magnetic susceptibility data reveal a
rapid reduction of T_(c) by increasing Ce content with a complete
suppression of superconductivity at the composition
La_(2.85)Ce_(0.15)Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ). The results of low-temperature
magnetic, the thermodynamic, and transport studies characterize
Ce₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) as an intermediate valence system with a Sommerfeld
value γ ≃ 54 mJ/mol K² and a low-temperature susceptibility
χ₀ ≃ 1.6 × 10⁻³ emu/mol. The latter values are moderately enhanced with
respect to the corresponding values of La₃Ni₂B₂N_(3 − δ) with γ = 26
mJ/mol K² and χ₀ ≃ 0.2 × 10⁻³ emu/mol. The high-temperature
susceptibility indicates a Ce valence of about 3.2. The electrical
resistivity and thermoelectric power are analyzed in terms of the
degenerate Anderson lattice model revealing a Kondo temperature of
$T_{K}^{\rm ALM}\sim 1100$ K.
