###### Abstract

We have studied magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ and its solid solution with the T_{c}\simeq 13 K superconductor La3Ni2B2N3-_d_. The solid solution (La,Ce)Ni2B2N3-_d_ reveals a rapid reduction of T_{c} by increasing the Ce content with a complete suppression of superconductivity at the composition La2.5KCe101Si2B2N3-_d_. The low-temperature properties characterize CeNi2B2N3-_d_ as an intermediate valence system with a moderately enhanced Sommerfeld value \gamma\simeq 54 mJ/mol K2 and a susceptibility \chi_{0}\simeq 1.6\times 10^{-3} emu/mol, increased by about one order of magnitude as compared to the respective value \chi_{0}\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-3} emu/mol of superconducting La3Ni2B2N3-_d_ (\gamma=26 mJ/mol K2) which serves as reference with a nonmagnetic rare earth ion. The electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power of Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ are analyzed in terms of the degenerate Anderson lattice model revealing a characteristic Kondo temperature T_{K}^{\rm{K}}\sim 1100 K.

## I Introduction

The persistent interest in intermetallic compounds containing cerium is due to their rich low-temperature physics interrelated with ground states such as the Kondo lattice with and without long-range magnetic order, intermediate valence, Kondo insulator, and in some cases unconventional superconductivity (see, e.g., Ref. [1] for a recent review). This variety of ground states adopted in cerium compounds is a consequence of competing interactions: RKKY-type Ce-Ce intersite exchange, crystal field effects, and Kondo interaction between Ce 4f and conduction electrons. A subtle balance between RKKY and Kondo interactions in some cases leads to the formation of novel ground states of correlated electrons such as magnetically mediated unconventional superconductivity. Cerium based superconductors at ambient pressure are, e.g., CeCu2Si2, Ce_T_In5, and non-centrosymmetric CePtSi. [2, 3, 4] From the earliest studies of magnetic pair breaking effects in rare earth elements by Matthias _et al._[5] cerium has been known to act as a strongly pair breaking impurity in a superconducting matrix.

A prominent system among intermetallics showing interplay of magnetism and superconductivity is the quaternary borocarbide, _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = rare earths and Y), with relatively high T_{c} (up to 16 K; see, e.g., Refs. [6] and [7]). In the corresponding solid solution with cerium, Y1-_x_CeNi2B2C, a complete suppression of superconductivity was observed at x\geqslant 0.25. [8] Studies of structural and magnetic features of CeNi2B2C revealed intermediate valence of Ce and absence of superconductivity down to 2 K. [9, 10] Interestingly, El-Massalami _et al._[11] reported conventional BCS type superconductivity for CeNi2B2C at temperatures below T_{c}\simeq 100 mK. The related quaternary boronitride, La3Ni2B2N3-_d_, with rocksalt type triple LaN layer sheets in between the NiB layers shows superconductivity with T_{c}\sim 12-15 K. [12, 13, 14] A cerium based homologue, Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_, was synthesized as powder material via a metathesis reaction by Glaser _et al._[16] Magnetic susceptibility measurements down to 5 K revealed neither superconductivity nor magnetic ordering. [16]

In this paper we investigate the ground state properties of bulk metallic samples of (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ by means of x-ray diffraction, susceptibility, specific heat, and transport measurements.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline samples of (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ were prepared by inductive levitation melting in a three step process. In the first step, stoichiometric amounts of Ni and B were melted several times in Ar atmosphere. In a second step, La and Ce metals were premelted in vacuum and then melted with NiB forming (La,Ce)3Ni2B2 precursor alloys. In a third step these alloys were repeatedly melted in Ar/N2 atmosphere such that the N-stoichiometry is slowly increased to reach a composition close to a nominal stoichiometry (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N-_d_. The latter was determined by measuring the mass gain after each melting cycle and by measuring the pressure drop within the recipient. The (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ alloys were flipped after each melting cycle to improve their homogeneity. The samples were finally annealed in a high-vacuum furnace at 1100 degC for 1 week. The starting materials were La and Ce ingot (Metall Rare Earth, 99.9%), Ni (Alpha Aesar, 99.99%), crystalline boron (HCTS, 99.5%), and nitrogen gas (Linde, 99.999 %). An additional Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ sample has been prepared using high purity Ce ingot (Ames MPC, [17] 99.95%). The nominal stoichiometry (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ was chosen because it was found to give the highest phase purity.

The phase purity of the samples was checked by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using monochromated Cu K\alpha radiation. Full profile Rietveld refinements were carried out using the fullprof program. [18] Magnetic measurements were performed on a CRYOGENIC SQUID magnetometer (3 K to room temperature) and on a Quantum Design 9 T vibrating sample magnetometer (VMS) equipped with a VSM oven operating up to 1000 K. Resistivity measurements were carried out on bar shaped samples with a standard four probe method in a 4He cryostat (4 - 400 K) and for Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ additionally in a 3He cryostat down to 350 mK. Specific heat measurements were made on 2-3 g samples employing an adiabatic step heating technique. Measurements of the thermoelectric power (TEP) were carried out from 4 K to 300 K with a so-called differential seesaw heating method in a ^{4}He cryostat and high-temperature measurements (340-800 K) were carried out on an ULVAC ZEM-3 measuring system.

## III Results and discussion

### Structural characterization

Powder XRD data of all samples of the series La33-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} display the body centered tetragonal La3Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3} type structure with space group I4/mmm. Except for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, some minor admixtures of the related two-layer boronitride (La,Ce)NiBN are identified with phase fractions of up to 5%. In the case of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} traces of an unidentified impurity phase are observed for both samples, one prepared with cerium produced by Metall Rare Earth and one prepared with highest purity cerium prepared by Ames MPC, but the two-layer phase CeNiBiN is not observed. Two exemplary powder XRD patterns of La3-xCeNi_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and their Rietveld refinements are shown in Fig. 1.

The variation of the lattice parameters a and c in the solid solution La3-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is summarized in Fig. 2. The lattice parameters a and c obtained for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} are 0.357 nm and 2.025 nm, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the lattice parameters reported earlier.[16] The reduction of the unit cell volume of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} as compared to La3Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is about 9%. As expected from the lanthanide contraction, the a lattice parameter decreases with increasing Ce fraction; however, the c lattice parameter shows a nonmonotonic variation with a maximum at about x = 0.2. An even opposite trend for the variation of the a and c lattice parameters was reported for the related quaternary borocarbides[9] which has been attributed to rather stiff Ni-B and B-C bonds leading to an increase in B-Ni-B tetrahedral angle and thus to a stretching of the tetragonal c axis when the basal plane lattice constant a contracts. The lanthanide contraction in La3-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} causes a similar effect on the NiB layers and their tetrahedral bonding angle which changes from \sim106^{\circ} for La3Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} to \sim104^{\circ} for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, however, in this case with an additional change in the width (parallel to the c axis) of the (La,Ce)NH triple layers, thus causing the nonmonotonic variation of the c lattice parameter shown in Fig. 2. We note that the change of the unit cell volume by about 9% in the series (La,Ce)_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is two orders of magnitude larger than the volume changes caused by varying the nominal nitrogen stoichiometry in La3Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{x}.[14]

### Superconductivity in La3-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}

The superconducting transition temperatures of La3-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1 were determined from dc susceptibility measurements (see Fig. 3) which were performed after zero field cooling (ZFC) at a field of 1 mT. Field-cooled susceptibility (not shown for the sake of clarity in Fig. 3) reveal Meissner fractions

  of about 10% due to strong pinning effects. The latter was discussed in detail in Ref. [19]. The susceptibility data reveal an almost linear reduction of T_{c} with increasing Ce fraction at a rate of dT_{c}/dx\simeq-8.9 K/Ce% in the formula La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and a corresponding critical concentration for the suppression of superconductivity of 1.3% Ce in the full formula with 10 atoms. In related light rare earth solid solutions La_{3-x}R_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with R= Pr and Nd we observed one order of magnitude larger critical concentrations of 19% and 10%, respectively.[15] The more rapid suppression of T_{c} in La_{3-x}Ce_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, i.e., the stronger pair-breaking introduced by Ce ions, is attributed to Kondo interactions and valence fluctuations. Interestingly, although parent boronitride and borocarbide compounds, La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and YNi_{2}B_{2}C, exhibit similar values of T_{c}\simeq 13 and 15 K, and similar upper critical fields H_{c2}(0)\sim 5-8 T,[20] the rate of suppression of T_{c} by Ce substitution in the boronitride system is significantly larger than the corresponding value of -2.5 K/Ce% reported by Alleno _et al.[8]_ for the related borocarbide system Y_{1-x}Ce_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C.

### Ground state properties of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}

#### 3.3.1 Results of thermodynamic and transport studies

The ground state properties of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} were studied by means of specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and thermoelectric power measurements. The normal state properties of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with an empty 4f shell are used as a reference for non-4f contributions. The specific heat of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} measured at zero external field and the normal state specific heat of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} measured at 9 T are shown in Fig. 4 as C_{p}/T vs T. The low-temperature electronic and lattice contributions of a plain metal are given by C_{p}=C_{e}+C_{\rm ph}\simeq\gamma+\beta T^{3} where \gamma is the Sommerfeld value and \beta is related to the low-temperature Debye temperature \Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}=(1944\times n/\beta)^{1/3}, where n=10 is number of atoms per formula unit. From the low-temperature fit of the Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} data (see inset in Fig. 4) we obtain \gamma\simeq 54 mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta\simeq 0.36 mJ/mol K^{4} corresponding to \Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}=378 K. The latter, however, might be misleading because the C\propto\beta T^{3} lattice term is superimposed by magnetic contributions from Ce 4f orbitals. In the case of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} the low-temperature data yield \gamma\simeq 26 mJ/mol K^{2} and \Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\simeq 329 K which are in agreement with the values reported in Ref. [19], \gamma\simeq 26 mJ/mol K^{2} and \Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\simeq 303 K. The enhanced electronic contribution to the specific heat of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} as compared to La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, i.e., \Delta\gamma\simeq 28 mJ/K^{2}mol, is attributed to magnetic contributions of Ce-4f in the intermediate valent regime.

The dc magnetic susceptibilities of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} were measured from 3 K to room temperature (RT) and from RT to 1000 K at applied fields of 1 T and 9 T, respectively [see Fig. 5 (a)]. While La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} displays (above its T_{c}) a simple, weakly temperature dependent Pauli paramagnetism with a low-temperature susceptibility, \chi_{0}\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-3} emu/mol, Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} exhibits about an order of magnitude larger susceptibility with a maximum at about 800 K. For both compounds, a small additional Curie-Weiss component is observed at low temperatures and a corresponding fit of the data from 10 to 200 K in terms of a temperature-independent component \chi_{0} plus a Curie-Weiss term \chi=\chi_{0}+C/(T-\theta) where C the Curie constant and \theta the paramagnetic Curie temperature yielding for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} a \chi_{0}\simeq 1.6\times 10^{-3} emu/mol and C\simeq 9\times 10^{-3} emu K/mol. In the case of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} the fit of the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility data gives \chi_{0}\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-3} emu/mol and C\simeq 4\times 10^{-3} emu K/mol. The paramagnetic Curie temperature for both the samples is of the order of -10 K. The Curie-Weiss-like contribution in Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is attributed to paramagnetic impurities (e.g., Gd traces of the order of 100 ppm in the La and Ce raw elements) and seems to be not an intrinsic property. The values of \chi_{0} and C obtained for La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} are close to values reported earlier.[21]

The moderately temperature dependent but nevertheless largely enhanced susceptibility of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is attributed to f-electron contributions from intermediate valent Ce ions with strongly Kondo screened Ce 4f moments. In

  order to obtain a measure for the 4f occupation from the susceptibility data we follow the approach proposed in Refs. [22, 23, 24]. Comparison of the Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}4f susceptibility (obtained by subtracting the La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} data) with the theoretical susceptibility of Ce^{3+} ions (4f^{1} configuration with a ground state total angular momentum J=5/2 and excited state J=7/2 separated by a spin-orbit splitting \Delta\simeq 3150 K; see, e.g., Ref. [26]) in a \chi\,T versus T plot in Fig. 5 (b) suggests a 4f occupation clearly larger than 0.7. We note that the temperature-dependent susceptibility \chi(T) of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} in Fig. 5(a) compares rather well with, e.g., \chi(T) of CeIr_{2} showing just slightly lower absolute values as compared to Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and a weak maximum at a slightly higher temperature \sim1000 K.[23] The values of \chi\,T(1000 K) are 0.63 emu K/mol-Ce and \sim0.55 emu K/mol-Ce for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and CeIr_{2}, respectively. For CeIr_{2} a cerium valence of 3.2 -3.23 has been reported from L_{\rm III} x-ray absorption studies.[24, 25] Thus, a realistic estimate for the 4f occupation of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is near 0.8.

The 4f contribution to the low-temperature susceptibility \Delta\chi(0)\simeq 1.4\times 10^{-3} emu/mol and the Sommerfeld value \Delta\gamma\simeq 28 mJ/K^{2}mol is analyzed in terms of the Fermi-liquid relation (see, e.g., Ref. [27]),

\[Rg_{J}^{2}J(J+1)\mu_{B}^{2}\Delta\gamma=\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}\Delta\chi,\] (1)

yielding for J=5/2 an experimental value of the Wilson ratio R\simeq 1.8 being slightly larger than the value expected for a degenerate Ce^{-3.2+} state.[28, 29]R=N/[N-1+(n_{f}-1)^{2}]\simeq 1.19 for a degeneracy N=6 and n_{f}=0.8.

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity \rho(T) of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is shown in Fig. 6. Except for small variations of the residual resistivities, absolute values of \rho(T) obtained in this study have been well reproduced with several samples of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}[14] and Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}. The superconducting La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} has a T_{c}^{\rho}\simeq 12.5 K while Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} remains in the normal state at least down to the base temperature of the experiment, i.e., 0.35 K. At temperatures below 30 K, the \rho(T) vs T^{2} graph of the experimental data shown as an inset in Fig. 3 reveals a quadratic temperature dependence \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}, with A\simeq 1.2\times 10^{-9}\Omega cm/K^{2}. This coefficient A yields a Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/\gamma^{2}\simeq 4\times 10^{-6}\mu\Omega cm (K mol-Ce/mJ)^{2} which is in between the typical Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/\gamma^{2}\sim 10^{-5}\mu\Omega cm (K mol-Ce/mJ)^{2} of (mostly twofold degenerate) cerium Kondo-lattice systems and the expected generalized Kadowaki-Woods ratio of Kondo lattice systems with sixfold degenerate Ce-4f moments[30] yielding A/\gamma^{2}\sim 0.7\times 10^{-6}\mu\Omega cm (mol K/mJ)^{2}.

The value of the coefficient A together with the Sommerfeld coefficient of the electronic specific heat is indicative of Kondo interaction in Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with a relatively high Kondo temperature as compared to typical crystal field splittings of the J=5/2 multiplet of the Ce 4f^{1} state. Accordingly, numerical results of a sixfold degenerate Anderson lattice model (ALM) without Ce-Ce intersite coupling compiled by Cox and Grewe[31] are used to analyze the resistivity and thermoelectric power [ALM model provides S(T>0.2T_{K}^{\rm ALM}); see below] of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}. In the simple fully degenerate case, i.e., for strong Kondo coupling as compared to the crystal field splitting, the ALM yields a universal temperature dependency for the magnetic contribution to the resistivity and also the TEP, which simply scale with the Kondo temperature T_{K}^{\rm ALM}.

The solid line indicates a fit according to the ALM and the dashed line shows the normal metal \rho_{0}+\rho_{\rm BG} contribution included in this fit. Inset: \rho vs T^{2} graph of the Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} data.

  To analyze the temperature-dependent resistivity data of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} a magnetic contribution according to the numerical ALM results, \rho_{\rm ALM}(T/T_{K}^{\rm ALM}), is combined with a Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model for the normal metal phonon contribution yielding

\[\rho(T) = \rho_{0}+\alpha\,\rho_{\rm ALM}\big{(}T/T_{K}^{\rm ALM}\big{)}\] (2) \[+\frac{4B}{\Theta_{D}}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)^{5}\int_{ 0}^{\Theta_{D}/T}\frac{z^{5}dz}{(e^{z}-1)(1-e^{-z})}.\]

A reasonable set of parameters (further corroborated by the analysis of the thermoelectric power discussed below) is \rho_{0}=17.6\mu\Omega cm [essentially fixed by \rho(T\to 0) data], \alpha=89.6\mu\Omega cm, T_{K}^{\rm ALM}=1100 K (characteristic Kondo temperature of the ALM model), the electron-phonon coupling constant B=0.013\Omega cm K, and Debye temperature \Theta_{D}^{\rho}=262 K of the Bloch-Gruneisen model. The resulting fit is indicated as solid line in Fig. 6. The resulting normal metal contribution, i.e., residual resistivity \rho_{0} plus phonon contribution according to the Bloch-Gruneisen fit, is in remarkably close agreement with the resistivity data of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} (in absolute values). The characteristic energy scale T_{K}^{\rm ALM}=1100 K is in fair agreement with the magnitude indicated by the maximum in the susceptibility near 800 K.

The temperature-dependent thermopower S(T) of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is shown in Fig. 7(b). For La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, S(T) is negative above T_{c} indicating a positive slope of the electronic density of states near the Fermi level. The mismatch between T<300 K and T>300 K data is an artifact of having used two different measuring techniques with imperfect overlap. The dashed-dotted line in Fig. 7(b) indicates a linear high-temperature extrapolation of the T<300 K measurement corresponding to S(T)=a+bT with a=-16.7 nV/K and b=-1.77\muV/K^{2}.

The TEP for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} exhibits a sharp linear increase at low temperature with an initial slope S/T\simeq 0.2\muV/K and a broad Kondo maximum at high temperature with S_{\rm max}\simeq 26\muV/K at about 500 K. The latter is analyzed in terms of the ALM data by Cox and Grewe [31] using the characteristic Kondo temperature T_{K}=1100 K derived above. When comparing the TEP of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with the _clean limit_ ALM calculation for sixfold degenerate Ce^{-3+} which yields a broad maximum S_{\rm max}=103\muV/K at T/T_{K}\simeq 0.6 (see Fig. 3 of Ref. [31]), it is necessary to consider in addition to Kondo scattering, at least, also defect and phonon scattering. The summation of different contributions to the TEP is highly nontrivial, in particular for a quaternary, layered compound such as Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with a complex multiband Fermi surface where in addition to contributions due to different scattering mechanisms, also contributions of different bands (index j) are to be added via the relation S=\sum_{j}S^{j}\sigma^{j}/\sigma with \sigma^{j} being the electrical conductivity of band j (see, e.g., Ref. [32]). The consideration of specific bands, however, looses relevance at elevated temperatures where interband scattering becomes strong. Thus, at high enough temperatures an estimate for the total diffusion thermopower S due to different types of scattering mechanisms \alpha, e.g., electron-defect (S_{e,0}), electron-electron (S_{e,e} or in the case of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} the Kondo contribution S_{\rm ALM} according to the ALM), and electron-phonon (S_{\rm ep}) scattering, is obtained via the Kohler relation,[33]

\[S=W^{-1}\sum_{\alpha}S_{\alpha}W_{\alpha},\] (3)

with W being the electronic thermal resistance. The latter obeys the Matthiessen rule, W=\sum_{\alpha}W_{\alpha}, where W_{\alpha} are the contributions due to particular scattering mechanisms \alpha. For simplicity of the analysis, W_{\alpha} is estimated via the Wiedemann-Franz law, W_{\alpha}(T)=\rho_{\alpha}(T)/L_{\alpha}T, assuming L_{e,0}\approx L_{\rm ep}\approx L_{e,e}\approx L_{0}=2.44\times 10^{-8} W\Omega/K^{2} (L_{0} is the Lorenz-number) where Eq. (3) conforms to the Northheim-Gorter rule. Accordingly, contributions W_{\rm ALM}, W_{0}+W_{\rm BG}, and the total electronic thermal resistance W_{\rm total} corresponding to the above analysis of the resistivity data are displayed in Fig. 7(a). An estimate for the contribution S_{e,0}+S_{\rm ep} is obtained from the La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} reference data [see the dashed-dotted line in Fig. 7(b)]. The latter together with the Kondo contribution S_{\rm ALM} are added according to the Kohler relation, thus yielding a total TEP based on the degenerate ALM with T_{K}=1100 K as indicated by the solid line in Fig. 7(b), which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.

The Kohler relation is not applicable in the low-temperature limit where many strongly correlated electron systems exhibit an approximately linear temperature dependence of the TEP which hardly depends on the level of elastic defect scattering

  (corresponding to the residual resistivity \rho_{0}). Rather, the Seebeck coefficient S is related to the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma,

\[\frac{S}{T}=q\frac{\gamma}{N_{A}e},\] (4)

where N_{A} is Avogadro's number and q is a dimensionless quantity which is found to be close to unity for most of the Ce based compounds.[34] For \gamma\simeq 18 mJ/K^{2}mol-Ce, the slope of the low-temperature part of the thermopower of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-4} [dashed line in Fig. 7(b)] yields S/T\simeq 0.2\muV/K^{2} revealing q\simeq 1, well in line with the empirical trend observed for a large number of Ce based compounds compiled by Behnia _et al_. in Ref. [34]. It is important to note that the T-linear TEP, and thus the phenomenological relation, Eq. (4), conforms with the Boltzmann picture of the free electron gas (see, e.g., Ref. [34]), as well as with _clean limit ALM_ results (see, e.g., Ref. [31]). The prominent shoulder-like feature of S(T) of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-4} visible in Fig. 7(b) at about 20-150 K, thus, results from a crossover between the S\propto\gamma\,T low-temperature regime and the high-temperature regime where different types of scattering mechanisms contribute to the the total diffusion thermopower as conceived by the Kohler relation. Accordingly, the shoulder-like feature of S(T) does not relate to an energy scale of Kondo or valence fluctuations which should have an appropriate correspondence in specific heat and susceptibility data.

## Conclusions

Powder XRD confirms the existence of a solid solution La_{3-x}Ce_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} from x=0-3 with the La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3} type structure and space group I4/mmm whereby the lattice parameter a follows the lanthanide contraction, i.e., decreases with increasing Ce-fraction, but the lattice parameter c shows a nonmonotonic variation with a maximum at low Ce fraction (x\sim 0.2). With respect to superconductivity of the parent compound La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, which is observed below T_{c}\simeq 13 K in the present study, magnetic susceptibility data reveal a rapid reduction of T_{c} by increasing Ce content with a complete suppression of superconductivity at the composition La_{2.85}Ce_{0.15}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}. The results of low-temperature magnetic, the thermodynamic, and transport studies characterize Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} as an intermediate valence system with a Sommerfeld value \gamma\simeq 54 mJ/mol K^{2} and a low-temperature susceptibility \chi_{0}\simeq 1.6\times 10^{-3} emu/mol. The latter values are moderately enhanced with respect to the corresponding values of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with \gamma=26 mJ/mol K^{2} and \chi_{0}\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-3} emu/mol. The high-temperature susceptibility indicates a Ce valence of about 3.2. The electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power are analyzed in terms of the degenerate Anderson lattice model revealing a Kondo temperature of T_{K}^{\rm ALM}\sim 1100 K.

###### Abstract

We have studied magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ and its solid solution with the T_{c}\simeq 13 K superconductor La3Ni2B2N3-_d_. The solid solution (La,Ce)Ni2B2N3-_d_ reveals a rapid reduction of T_{c} by increasing the Ce content with a complete suppression of superconductivity at the composition La2.5KCe101Si2B2N3-_d_. The low-temperature properties characterize CeNi2B2N3-_d_ as an intermediate valence system with a moderately enhanced Sommerfeld value \gamma\simeq 54 mJ/mol K2 and a susceptibility \chi_{0}\simeq 1.6\times 10^{-3} emu/mol, increased by about one order of magnitude as compared to the respective value \chi_{0}\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-3} emu/mol of superconducting La3Ni2B2N3-_d_ (\gamma=26 mJ/mol K2) which serves as reference with a nonmagnetic rare earth ion. The electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power of Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ are analyzed in terms of the degenerate Anderson lattice model revealing a characteristic Kondo temperature T_{K}^{\rm{K}}\sim 1100 K.

## I Introduction

The persistent interest in intermetallic compounds containing cerium is due to their rich low-temperature physics interrelated with ground states such as the Kondo lattice with and without long-range magnetic order, intermediate valence, Kondo insulator, and in some cases unconventional superconductivity (see, e.g., Ref. [1] for a recent review). This variety of ground states adopted in cerium compounds is a consequence of competing interactions: RKKY-type Ce-Ce intersite exchange, crystal field effects, and Kondo interaction between Ce 4f and conduction electrons. A subtle balance between RKKY and Kondo interactions in some cases leads to the formation of novel ground states of correlated electrons such as magnetically mediated unconventional superconductivity. Cerium based superconductors at ambient pressure are, e.g., CeCu2Si2, Ce_T_In5, and non-centrosymmetric CePtSi. [2, 3, 4] From the earliest studies of magnetic pair breaking effects in rare earth elements by Matthias _et al._[5] cerium has been known to act as a strongly pair breaking impurity in a superconducting matrix.

A prominent system among intermetallics showing interplay of magnetism and superconductivity is the quaternary borocarbide, _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = rare earths and Y), with relatively high T_{c} (up to 16 K; see, e.g., Refs. [6] and [7]). In the corresponding solid solution with cerium, Y1-_x_CeNi2B2C, a complete suppression of superconductivity was observed at x\geqslant 0.25. [8] Studies of structural and magnetic features of CeNi2B2C revealed intermediate valence of Ce and absence of superconductivity down to 2 K. [9, 10] Interestingly, El-Massalami _et al._[11] reported conventional BCS type superconductivity for CeNi2B2C at temperatures below T_{c}\simeq 100 mK. The related quaternary boronitride, La3Ni2B2N3-_d_, with rocksalt type triple LaN layer sheets in between the NiB layers shows superconductivity with T_{c}\sim 12-15 K. [12, 13, 14] A cerium based homologue, Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_, was synthesized as powder material via a metathesis reaction by Glaser _et al._[16] Magnetic susceptibility measurements down to 5 K revealed neither superconductivity nor magnetic ordering. [16]

In this paper we investigate the ground state properties of bulk metallic samples of (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ by means of x-ray diffraction, susceptibility, specific heat, and transport measurements.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline samples of (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ were prepared by inductive levitation melting in a three step process. In the first step, stoichiometric amounts of Ni and B were melted several times in Ar atmosphere. In a second step, La and Ce metals were premelted in vacuum and then melted with NiB forming (La,Ce)3Ni2B2 precursor alloys. In a third step these alloys were repeatedly melted in Ar/N2 atmosphere such that the N-stoichiometry is slowly increased to reach a composition close to a nominal stoichiometry (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N-_d_. The latter was determined by measuring the mass gain after each melting cycle and by measuring the pressure drop within the recipient. The (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ alloys were flipped after each melting cycle to improve their homogeneity. The samples were finally annealed in a high-vacuum furnace at 1100 degC for 1 week. The starting materials were La and Ce ingot (Metall Rare Earth, 99.9%), Ni (Alpha Aesar, 99.99%), crystalline boron (HCTS, 99.5%), and nitrogen gas (Linde, 99.999 %). An additional Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ sample has been prepared using high purity Ce ingot (Ames MPC, [17] 99.95%). The nominal stoichiometry (La,Ce)3Ni2B2N3-_d_ was chosen because it was found to give the highest phase purity.

The phase purity of the samples was checked by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using monochromated Cu K\alpha radiation. Full profile Rietveld refinements were carried out using the fullprof program. [18] Magnetic measurements were performed on a CRYOGENIC SQUID magnetometer (3 K to room temperature) and on a Quantum Design 9 T vibrating sample magnetometer (VMS) equipped with a VSM oven operating up to 1000 K. Resistivity measurements were carried out on bar shaped samples with a standard four probe method in a 4He cryostat (4 - 400 K) and for Ce3Ni2B2N3-_d_ additionally in a 3He cryostat down to 350 mK. Specific heat measurements were made on 2-3 g samples employing an adiabatic step heating technique. Measurements of the thermoelectric power (TEP) were carried out from 4 K to 300 K with a so-called differential seesaw heating method in a ^{4}He cryostat and high-temperature measurements (340-800 K) were carried out on an ULVAC ZEM-3 measuring system.

## III Results and discussion

### Structural characterization

Powder XRD data of all samples of the series La33-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} display the body centered tetragonal La3Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3} type structure with space group I4/mmm. Except for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, some minor admixtures of the related two-layer boronitride (La,Ce)NiBN are identified with phase fractions of up to 5%. In the case of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} traces of an unidentified impurity phase are observed for both samples, one prepared with cerium produced by Metall Rare Earth and one prepared with highest purity cerium prepared by Ames MPC, but the two-layer phase CeNiBiN is not observed. Two exemplary powder XRD patterns of La3-xCeNi_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and their Rietveld refinements are shown in Fig. 1.

The variation of the lattice parameters a and c in the solid solution La3-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is summarized in Fig. 2. The lattice parameters a and c obtained for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} are 0.357 nm and 2.025 nm, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the lattice parameters reported earlier.[16] The reduction of the unit cell volume of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} as compared to La3Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is about 9%. As expected from the lanthanide contraction, the a lattice parameter decreases with increasing Ce fraction; however, the c lattice parameter shows a nonmonotonic variation with a maximum at about x = 0.2. An even opposite trend for the variation of the a and c lattice parameters was reported for the related quaternary borocarbides[9] which has been attributed to rather stiff Ni-B and B-C bonds leading to an increase in B-Ni-B tetrahedral angle and thus to a stretching of the tetragonal c axis when the basal plane lattice constant a contracts. The lanthanide contraction in La3-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} causes a similar effect on the NiB layers and their tetrahedral bonding angle which changes from \sim106^{\circ} for La3Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} to \sim104^{\circ} for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, however, in this case with an additional change in the width (parallel to the c axis) of the (La,Ce)NH triple layers, thus causing the nonmonotonic variation of the c lattice parameter shown in Fig. 2. We note that the change of the unit cell volume by about 9% in the series (La,Ce)_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is two orders of magnitude larger than the volume changes caused by varying the nominal nitrogen stoichiometry in La3Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{x}.[14]

### Superconductivity in La3-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}

The superconducting transition temperatures of La3-xCe_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with x = 0, 0.05, and 0.1 were determined from dc susceptibility measurements (see Fig. 3) which were performed after zero field cooling (ZFC) at a field of 1 mT. Field-cooled susceptibility (not shown for the sake of clarity in Fig. 3) reveal Meissner fractions

  of about 10% due to strong pinning effects. The latter was discussed in detail in Ref. [19]. The susceptibility data reveal an almost linear reduction of T_{c} with increasing Ce fraction at a rate of dT_{c}/dx\simeq-8.9 K/Ce% in the formula La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and a corresponding critical concentration for the suppression of superconductivity of 1.3% Ce in the full formula with 10 atoms. In related light rare earth solid solutions La_{3-x}R_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with R= Pr and Nd we observed one order of magnitude larger critical concentrations of 19% and 10%, respectively.[15] The more rapid suppression of T_{c} in La_{3-x}Ce_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, i.e., the stronger pair-breaking introduced by Ce ions, is attributed to Kondo interactions and valence fluctuations. Interestingly, although parent boronitride and borocarbide compounds, La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and YNi_{2}B_{2}C, exhibit similar values of T_{c}\simeq 13 and 15 K, and similar upper critical fields H_{c2}(0)\sim 5-8 T,[20] the rate of suppression of T_{c} by Ce substitution in the boronitride system is significantly larger than the corresponding value of -2.5 K/Ce% reported by Alleno _et al.[8]_ for the related borocarbide system Y_{1-x}Ce_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}C.

### Ground state properties of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}

#### 3.3.1 Results of thermodynamic and transport studies

The ground state properties of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} were studied by means of specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and thermoelectric power measurements. The normal state properties of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with an empty 4f shell are used as a reference for non-4f contributions. The specific heat of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} measured at zero external field and the normal state specific heat of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} measured at 9 T are shown in Fig. 4 as C_{p}/T vs T. The low-temperature electronic and lattice contributions of a plain metal are given by C_{p}=C_{e}+C_{\rm ph}\simeq\gamma+\beta T^{3} where \gamma is the Sommerfeld value and \beta is related to the low-temperature Debye temperature \Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}=(1944\times n/\beta)^{1/3}, where n=10 is number of atoms per formula unit. From the low-temperature fit of the Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} data (see inset in Fig. 4) we obtain \gamma\simeq 54 mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta\simeq 0.36 mJ/mol K^{4} corresponding to \Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}=378 K. The latter, however, might be misleading because the C\propto\beta T^{3} lattice term is superimposed by magnetic contributions from Ce 4f orbitals. In the case of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} the low-temperature data yield \gamma\simeq 26 mJ/mol K^{2} and \Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\simeq 329 K which are in agreement with the values reported in Ref. [19], \gamma\simeq 26 mJ/mol K^{2} and \Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\simeq 303 K. The enhanced electronic contribution to the specific heat of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} as compared to La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, i.e., \Delta\gamma\simeq 28 mJ/K^{2}mol, is attributed to magnetic contributions of Ce-4f in the intermediate valent regime.

The dc magnetic susceptibilities of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} were measured from 3 K to room temperature (RT) and from RT to 1000 K at applied fields of 1 T and 9 T, respectively [see Fig. 5 (a)]. While La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} displays (above its T_{c}) a simple, weakly temperature dependent Pauli paramagnetism with a low-temperature susceptibility, \chi_{0}\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-3} emu/mol, Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} exhibits about an order of magnitude larger susceptibility with a maximum at about 800 K. For both compounds, a small additional Curie-Weiss component is observed at low temperatures and a corresponding fit of the data from 10 to 200 K in terms of a temperature-independent component \chi_{0} plus a Curie-Weiss term \chi=\chi_{0}+C/(T-\theta) where C the Curie constant and \theta the paramagnetic Curie temperature yielding for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} a \chi_{0}\simeq 1.6\times 10^{-3} emu/mol and C\simeq 9\times 10^{-3} emu K/mol. In the case of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} the fit of the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility data gives \chi_{0}\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-3} emu/mol and C\simeq 4\times 10^{-3} emu K/mol. The paramagnetic Curie temperature for both the samples is of the order of -10 K. The Curie-Weiss-like contribution in Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is attributed to paramagnetic impurities (e.g., Gd traces of the order of 100 ppm in the La and Ce raw elements) and seems to be not an intrinsic property. The values of \chi_{0} and C obtained for La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} are close to values reported earlier.[21]

The moderately temperature dependent but nevertheless largely enhanced susceptibility of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is attributed to f-electron contributions from intermediate valent Ce ions with strongly Kondo screened Ce 4f moments. In

  order to obtain a measure for the 4f occupation from the susceptibility data we follow the approach proposed in Refs. [22, 23, 24]. Comparison of the Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}4f susceptibility (obtained by subtracting the La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} data) with the theoretical susceptibility of Ce^{3+} ions (4f^{1} configuration with a ground state total angular momentum J=5/2 and excited state J=7/2 separated by a spin-orbit splitting \Delta\simeq 3150 K; see, e.g., Ref. [26]) in a \chi\,T versus T plot in Fig. 5 (b) suggests a 4f occupation clearly larger than 0.7. We note that the temperature-dependent susceptibility \chi(T) of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} in Fig. 5(a) compares rather well with, e.g., \chi(T) of CeIr_{2} showing just slightly lower absolute values as compared to Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and a weak maximum at a slightly higher temperature \sim1000 K.[23] The values of \chi\,T(1000 K) are 0.63 emu K/mol-Ce and \sim0.55 emu K/mol-Ce for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and CeIr_{2}, respectively. For CeIr_{2} a cerium valence of 3.2 -3.23 has been reported from L_{\rm III} x-ray absorption studies.[24, 25] Thus, a realistic estimate for the 4f occupation of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is near 0.8.

The 4f contribution to the low-temperature susceptibility \Delta\chi(0)\simeq 1.4\times 10^{-3} emu/mol and the Sommerfeld value \Delta\gamma\simeq 28 mJ/K^{2}mol is analyzed in terms of the Fermi-liquid relation (see, e.g., Ref. [27]),

\[Rg_{J}^{2}J(J+1)\mu_{B}^{2}\Delta\gamma=\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}\Delta\chi,\] (1)

yielding for J=5/2 an experimental value of the Wilson ratio R\simeq 1.8 being slightly larger than the value expected for a degenerate Ce^{-3.2+} state.[28, 29]R=N/[N-1+(n_{f}-1)^{2}]\simeq 1.19 for a degeneracy N=6 and n_{f}=0.8.

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity \rho(T) of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is shown in Fig. 6. Except for small variations of the residual resistivities, absolute values of \rho(T) obtained in this study have been well reproduced with several samples of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}[14] and Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}. The superconducting La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} has a T_{c}^{\rho}\simeq 12.5 K while Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} remains in the normal state at least down to the base temperature of the experiment, i.e., 0.35 K. At temperatures below 30 K, the \rho(T) vs T^{2} graph of the experimental data shown as an inset in Fig. 3 reveals a quadratic temperature dependence \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}, with A\simeq 1.2\times 10^{-9}\Omega cm/K^{2}. This coefficient A yields a Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/\gamma^{2}\simeq 4\times 10^{-6}\mu\Omega cm (K mol-Ce/mJ)^{2} which is in between the typical Kadowaki-Woods ratio A/\gamma^{2}\sim 10^{-5}\mu\Omega cm (K mol-Ce/mJ)^{2} of (mostly twofold degenerate) cerium Kondo-lattice systems and the expected generalized Kadowaki-Woods ratio of Kondo lattice systems with sixfold degenerate Ce-4f moments[30] yielding A/\gamma^{2}\sim 0.7\times 10^{-6}\mu\Omega cm (mol K/mJ)^{2}.

The value of the coefficient A together with the Sommerfeld coefficient of the electronic specific heat is indicative of Kondo interaction in Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with a relatively high Kondo temperature as compared to typical crystal field splittings of the J=5/2 multiplet of the Ce 4f^{1} state. Accordingly, numerical results of a sixfold degenerate Anderson lattice model (ALM) without Ce-Ce intersite coupling compiled by Cox and Grewe[31] are used to analyze the resistivity and thermoelectric power [ALM model provides S(T>0.2T_{K}^{\rm ALM}); see below] of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}. In the simple fully degenerate case, i.e., for strong Kondo coupling as compared to the crystal field splitting, the ALM yields a universal temperature dependency for the magnetic contribution to the resistivity and also the TEP, which simply scale with the Kondo temperature T_{K}^{\rm ALM}.

Inset: \rho vs T^{2} graph of the Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} data.

  To analyze the temperature-dependent resistivity data of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} a magnetic contribution according to the numerical ALM results, \rho_{\rm ALM}(T/T_{K}^{\rm ALM}), is combined with a Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model for the normal metal phonon contribution yielding

\[\rho(T) = \rho_{0}+\alpha\,\rho_{\rm ALM}\big{(}T/T_{K}^{\rm ALM}\big{)}\] (2) \[+\frac{4B}{\Theta_{D}}\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)^{5}\int_{ 0}^{\Theta_{D}/T}\frac{z^{5}dz}{(e^{z}-1)(1-e^{-z})}.\]

A reasonable set of parameters (further corroborated by the analysis of the thermoelectric power discussed below) is \rho_{0}=17.6\mu\Omega cm [essentially fixed by \rho(T\to 0) data], \alpha=89.6\mu\Omega cm, T_{K}^{\rm ALM}=1100 K (characteristic Kondo temperature of the ALM model), the electron-phonon coupling constant B=0.013\Omega cm K, and Debye temperature \Theta_{D}^{\rho}=262 K of the Bloch-Gruneisen model. The resulting fit is indicated as solid line in Fig. 6. The resulting normal metal contribution, i.e., residual resistivity \rho_{0} plus phonon contribution according to the Bloch-Gruneisen fit, is in remarkably close agreement with the resistivity data of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} (in absolute values). The characteristic energy scale T_{K}^{\rm ALM}=1100 K is in fair agreement with the magnitude indicated by the maximum in the susceptibility near 800 K.

The temperature-dependent thermopower S(T) of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} and Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} is shown in Fig. 7(b). For La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, S(T) is negative above T_{c} indicating a positive slope of the electronic density of states near the Fermi level. The mismatch between T<300 K and T>300 K data is an artifact of having used two different measuring techniques with imperfect overlap. The dashed-dotted line in Fig. 7(b) indicates a linear high-temperature extrapolation of the T<300 K measurement corresponding to S(T)=a+bT with a=-16.7 nV/K and b=-1.77\muV/K^{2}.

The TEP for Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} exhibits a sharp linear increase at low temperature with an initial slope S/T\simeq 0.2\muV/K and a broad Kondo maximum at high temperature with S_{\rm max}\simeq 26\muV/K at about 500 K. The latter is analyzed in terms of the ALM data by Cox and Grewe [31] using the characteristic Kondo temperature T_{K}=1100 K derived above. When comparing the TEP of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with the _clean limit_ ALM calculation for sixfold degenerate Ce^{-3+} which yields a broad maximum S_{\rm max}=103\muV/K at T/T_{K}\simeq 0.6 (see Fig. 3 of Ref. [31]), it is necessary to consider in addition to Kondo scattering, at least, also defect and phonon scattering. The summation of different contributions to the TEP is highly nontrivial, in particular for a quaternary, layered compound such as Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with a complex multiband Fermi surface where in addition to contributions due to different scattering mechanisms, also contributions of different bands (index j) are to be added via the relation S=\sum_{j}S^{j}\sigma^{j}/\sigma with \sigma^{j} being the electrical conductivity of band j (see, e.g., Ref. [32]). The consideration of specific bands, however, looses relevance at elevated temperatures where interband scattering becomes strong. Thus, at high enough temperatures an estimate for the total diffusion thermopower S due to different types of scattering mechanisms \alpha, e.g., electron-defect (S_{e,0}), electron-electron (S_{e,e} or in the case of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} the Kondo contribution S_{\rm ALM} according to the ALM), and electron-phonon (S_{\rm ep}) scattering, is obtained via the Kohler relation,[33]

\[S=W^{-1}\sum_{\alpha}S_{\alpha}W_{\alpha},\] (3)

with W being the electronic thermal resistance. The latter obeys the Matthiessen rule, W=\sum_{\alpha}W_{\alpha}, where W_{\alpha} are the contributions due to particular scattering mechanisms \alpha. For simplicity of the analysis, W_{\alpha} is estimated via the Wiedemann-Franz law, W_{\alpha}(T)=\rho_{\alpha}(T)/L_{\alpha}T, assuming L_{e,0}\approx L_{\rm ep}\approx L_{e,e}\approx L_{0}=2.44\times 10^{-8} W\Omega/K^{2} (L_{0} is the Lorenz-number) where Eq. (3) conforms to the Northheim-Gorter rule. Accordingly, contributions W_{\rm ALM}, W_{0}+W_{\rm BG}, and the total electronic thermal resistance W_{\rm total} corresponding to the above analysis of the resistivity data are displayed in Fig. 7(a). An estimate for the contribution S_{e,0}+S_{\rm ep} is obtained from the La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} reference data [see the dashed-dotted line in Fig. 7(b)]. The latter together with the Kondo contribution S_{\rm ALM} are added according to the Kohler relation, thus yielding a total TEP based on the degenerate ALM with T_{K}=1100 K as indicated by the solid line in Fig. 7(b), which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data.

The Kohler relation is not applicable in the low-temperature limit where many strongly correlated electron systems exhibit an approximately linear temperature dependence of the TEP which hardly depends on the level of elastic defect scattering

  (corresponding to the residual resistivity \rho_{0}). Rather, the Seebeck coefficient S is related to the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma,

\[\frac{S}{T}=q\frac{\gamma}{N_{A}e},\] (4)

where N_{A} is Avogadro's number and q is a dimensionless quantity which is found to be close to unity for most of the Ce based compounds.[34] For \gamma\simeq 18 mJ/K^{2}mol-Ce, the slope of the low-temperature part of the thermopower of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-4} [dashed line in Fig. 7(b)] yields S/T\simeq 0.2\muV/K^{2} revealing q\simeq 1, well in line with the empirical trend observed for a large number of Ce based compounds compiled by Behnia _et al_. in Ref. [34]. It is important to note that the T-linear TEP, and thus the phenomenological relation, Eq. (4), conforms with the Boltzmann picture of the free electron gas (see, e.g., Ref. [34]), as well as with _clean limit ALM_ results (see, e.g., Ref. [31]). The prominent shoulder-like feature of S(T) of Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-4} visible in Fig. 7(b) at about 20-150 K, thus, results from a crossover between the S\propto\gamma\,T low-temperature regime and the high-temperature regime where different types of scattering mechanisms contribute to the the total diffusion thermopower as conceived by the Kohler relation. Accordingly, the shoulder-like feature of S(T) does not relate to an energy scale of Kondo or valence fluctuations which should have an appropriate correspondence in specific heat and susceptibility data.

## Conclusions

Powder XRD confirms the existence of a solid solution La_{3-x}Ce_{x}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} from x=0-3 with the La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3} type structure and space group I4/mmm whereby the lattice parameter a follows the lanthanide contraction, i.e., decreases with increasing Ce-fraction, but the lattice parameter c shows a nonmonotonic variation with a maximum at low Ce fraction (x\sim 0.2). With respect to superconductivity of the parent compound La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}, which is observed below T_{c}\simeq 13 K in the present study, magnetic susceptibility data reveal a rapid reduction of T_{c} by increasing Ce content with a complete suppression of superconductivity at the composition La_{2.85}Ce_{0.15}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta}. The results of low-temperature magnetic, the thermodynamic, and transport studies characterize Ce_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} as an intermediate valence system with a Sommerfeld value \gamma\simeq 54 mJ/mol K^{2} and a low-temperature susceptibility \chi_{0}\simeq 1.6\times 10^{-3} emu/mol. The latter values are moderately enhanced with respect to the corresponding values of La_{3}Ni_{2}B_{2}N_{3-\delta} with \gamma=26 mJ/mol K^{2} and \chi_{0}\simeq 0.2\times 10^{-3} emu/mol. The high-temperature susceptibility indicates a Ce valence of about 3.2. The electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power are analyzed in terms of the degenerate Anderson lattice model revealing a Kondo temperature of T_{K}^{\rm ALM}\sim 1100 K.
