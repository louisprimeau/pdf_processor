###### Abstract

A high temperature Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d (_y_ = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) superconductor with four ZnO2 planes is synthesized, in which the zero resistivity critical temperature [_Tc_(_R_ = 0)], the quantity of diamagnetism, and critical current density (_Jc_) are found to increase with enhanced Zn doping. From the x-ray diffraction studies, the _c_-axis lengths are found to decrease with increased Zn doping in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d The softening of apical oxygen modes observed in Fourier transform infrared absorption measurements has shown that the decreased _c_-axis length is among CuO2/ZnO2 planes. The decreased _c_-axis length increases the Fermi vector _kF_, the coherence length _k_c, and the superconductivity order parameter, which result into enhanced superconducting properties. The superconducting properties in these compounds were further enhanced by optimizing the carriers in CuO2/ZnO2 planes. The optimum numbers of carriers in these compounds were achieved by postannealing the samples in oxygen atmosphere.

## I Introduction

The substitution of impurity atoms in high _Tc_ cuprates (HTSCs) has been used as a probe for the study of underlying mechanism of superconductivity. [1-21] In previous studies, the magnetic impurities substituents such as Ni [1-2] at CuO2 planar sites and Co and Fe at the chain sites of the unit cell have been found to suppress the superconducting properties. [22-27] The doping of nonmagnetic impurity atoms such as Zn [1-2] the CuO2 planar sites has also been found to decrease the critical temperature [_Tc_(_R_ = 0)] in all the families of HTSCs. [1-27] The suppression of _Tc_ in anisotropic _d_-wave HTSCs with the doping of Zn [1-2] atoms at CuO2 planar sites was quite astonishing and suggested to be originating from the pair-breaking mechanism or electronic localization induced by dopant atoms. [28-51] In YBa2Cu3O7-d superconductor, [34] the localization of the carriers at Cu [1-2] atoms is in the immediate vicinity of Zn [1-2] atoms which was suggested to be one of the main root causes of depression of critical temperature. The suppression of superfluid density has also been observed in infrared conductivity experiments in Zn doped YBa2Cu4-Zn3O8 single crystals and a decrease of _Tc_(_R_ = 0) in part was suggested to be associated with the localization of carriers. [38] We have recently observed enhanced superconductivity by Zn doping in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d (_y_ = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) superconductors, which is quite contrary to all the previous studies on Zn doped cuprate HTSCs. In these Zn doped superconductors, we have also tried to explore the possibility of existence of localization of carriers at Cu [1-2] and /or Zn [1-2] sites by carrying out postannealing experiments in nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres. Through these studies, we have observed that there is no localization of the carriers to the Cu [1-2] or Zn [1-2] sites in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d superconductors. In the light of the present results, we have looked into the possible reasons for the suppression of superconductivity by Zn doping in all previous studies.

## II Experiment

The Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d (_y_ = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) samples were prepared by the solid state reaction method accomplished in two stages. At the first stage, Cu0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d precursor material was prepared by thoroughly mixing ZnO, Ba(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)2, and Cu(CN) in a quartz mortar and pestle in appropriate ratios. The mixed material was fired twice at 880 degC in a quartz boat for 24 h and furnace cooled to room temperature. At the second stage, the precursor material was ground for about an hour and mixed with Tl2O3 to give Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d as the final reactant composition. Thallium mixed material was pelletized under 3.8 tons/cm2 and the pellets were enclosed in a gold capsule. Gold capsule containing pellets were annealed for about 10 min at 880 degC followed by quenching to room temperature. The samples were characterized by resistivity, ac susceptibility, and critical current density measurements. The structure of the material was determined by x-ray diffraction scan from Rigaku D/Max IIIC using a Cu _K_a_ source with wavelength of 1.540 56 A and the cell parameters were determined by a cell refinement computer program. The phonon modes related to the vibrations of various oxygen atoms in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d unit cell were observed by Nicolet 5700 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer in the 400-650 cm-1 wave number range. The postannealing of the samples was carried out at 550 degC for 6 h. This temperature is chosen because oxygen intercalation into the unit cell is observed around this temperature regime. The oxygen content of the samples were determined by standard iodometric titration method. [52-54]

## III Results and Discussion

The x-ray diffraction scan of Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu1Zn3O12-d superconductor is shown in Fig. 1 in the inset of this figure, a decrease in the _c_-axis lengths with the increased Zn doping is shown. Most of the diffraction lines are fitted following the _P4/mmm_ space group and tetragonal structure. The decreased _c_-axis length with the increased Zn concentration shows an improved interplane coupling, which is consistent with previous studies carried out on Zn doped samples. [31] The effect of decreased c-axis length can also be seen in the form of softening of phonon modes [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60] of apical oxygen atoms in Zn doped Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.8}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{1-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} samples. In Zn-free samples (y=0), the phonon modes related to apical oxygen atoms [61, 62, 63, 64] of type Tl-O_{4}-Cu(2) and Cu(1)-O_{4}-Cu(2) are observed around 501 and 537 cm^{-1}, which are softened in all Zn doped samples to 453-455 and 514-524 cm^{-1}, respectively (Fig. 2). These two modes are of Tl-O_{4}-Cu(2)/Zn and Cu(1)-O_{4}-Cu(2)/Zn types. If the softening of these apical oxygen modes is linked with the decreased c-axis lengths observed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, then it becomes evident that the bond distances along the c axis are decreased between the CuO_{2}/ZnO_{2} planes. The planar mode of oxygen atoms in Zn free samples (y=0) is observed around 575 cm^{-1}, which is softened in Zn doped Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.8}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{1-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} samples to 572-565 cm^{-1}. The softening of planar oxygen mode is most likely arising from the increased mass of Zn (65.38 amu) with respect to Cu (63.546 amu).

The resistivity measurements of Zn doped Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.8}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} (y=0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) samples are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the magnitude of normal state resistivity decreases and T_{c}(_R_ =0) increases with the increased Zn concentration in Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.8}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} unit cell. The bulk superconductivity in the samples checked by ac susceptibility measurements are shown in Fig. 4; for a relative comparison of magnitude of diamagnetism in all Zn doped samples, we have normalized the ac signal to the mass of the sample. The onset of the superconductivity, magnitude of diamagnetism, and peak temperatures (T_{P}) observed in the out of phase component of magnetic ac susceptibility are found to increase systematically with the increased Zn doping in Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} samples (Fig. 5). T_{P} is related to H_{c} (critical magnetic field) and hence to the critical current density (J_{c}) of the samples [65, 66]. The increase in T_{p} with increased Zn doping suggested that J_{c} is enhanced with Zn doping, which is also observed in transport J_{c} measurements, as discussed in the next section. In the previous studies on Zn doped HTSC systems, T_{c}(_R_=0) and magnitude of diamagnetism are significantly suppressed by enhanced Zn^{+2} doping in the final compound. The localization of free carriers at Cu^{+2} sites in the neighborhood of Zn^{+2} atoms was suggested to be the main route cause of T_{c}(_R_=0) suppression in those studies. Those Cu^{+2} atoms having a localization of carriers in their neighborhoods behave as efficient scattering centers [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] which are absent altogether in our Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} superconductors.

The possibility of existence of localization of carriers to the Cu^{+2} sites in the neighborhood of Zn^{+2} atoms, if present, could be enhanced by increasing and/or decreasing the carrier concentration in CuO_{2}/ZnO_{2} planes. In order to change the carrier concentration in CuO_{2}/ZnO_{2} planes, we have carried out postannealing experiments at 550 ^{\circ}C in oxygen, air, and nitrogen atmospheres. For such studies, we have chosen the samples without Zn (y=0) and with maximum Zn doping (y=3.5). T_{c}(_R_=0), T_{p}, I_{c}, and oxygen content for these experiments are summarized in Fig. 6. Since oxygen has the second highest electronegativity in the Periodic Table of elements, the intercalation of it in the Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}Ba_{2}O_{4-\delta} charge reservoir layer can efficiently dope the charge carriers to conducting CuO_{2}/ZnO_{2} planes. The higher oxygen content

  in the charge reservoir layer decreases, whereas their lower concentration increases the electron density in conducting planes; the former enhances, while the later decreases the number of holes in ZnO2/CuO2 planes. T_{c}(_R_=0), T_{p}, I_{c}, and oxygen content of Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-,Zn3O12-_δ_ (y=0, 3.5) samples are increased after postannealing in oxygen, whereas these parameters are suppressed by postannealing in air and nitrogen atmospheres. The increased oxygen content in the samples after postannealing in oxygen led to a suggestion that the more intake of oxygen in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2O4-_δ_ charge reservoir layer brings the concentration of electrons in the conducting ZnO2/CuO2 planes to an optimum level, which consequently reduce the electron hole recombination processes at lower temperatures and an enhancement in the population of holes in conducting planes is promoted. The enhanced carrier's density in ZnO2/CuO2 planes promotes an increase in the Fermi vector k_{F}=(3\pi^{2}N/V)^{1/3}, the coherence length along the c axis \xi_{c}=(\hbar k_{F}/2m\Delta), and the Fermi velocity v_{F}=(\pi\xi_{c}\Delta/\hbar) of the carriers,[67, 68] which ultimately enhance the superconductivity parameters.

These self-doping experiments were performed to determine unequivocal evidence of the role played by doped carriers in ZnO2/CuO2 planes in the mechanism of superconductivity in these Zn doped compounds. As proposed in the previous studies that Zn doping promotes localization of carriers to the Cu+2 sites in the immediate vicinity of Zn+2 atoms. It was expected that increased hole concentration in ZnO2/CuO2 planes by the postannealing in oxygen would have enhanced such proposed localization processes. To our surprise, no such localization has been observed; otherwise, it would have killed the superconductivity; instead, it is enhanced. These experiments lead us to a conclusion that the role of the doped carriers in the conducting planes is primary and their localization at Cu+2/Zn+2 sites is absent altogether in our Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu0.5Zn3.5O12-_δ_ superconductor. The decreased hole concentration as a result of postannealing in air and nitrogen makes the superconductor inferior but no localization of carrier is witnessed; otherwise, superconductivity would have been destroyed. These studies also suggested that the role of the ratio of divalent/trivalent (Cu+2/Pl+3) atoms in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2O4-_δ_ charge reservoir layer is primary in supplying the charge carriers to the CuO2/ZnO2 planes.

The question arises that why in the previous studies the superconductivity is suppressed by Zn doping in all cuprate HTSC systems?[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,  tween the CuO_{2} planes. The presence of trivalent ions, most likely localize the carriers in their neighborhood and their localization at the Cu^{+2} sites in the vicinity of Zn^{+2} atoms, as suggested in previous studies, is unlikely. These experiments have also shown that when 100% trivalent ions are present in the charge reservoir layers, it is most likely incapable of supplying carriers to the conducting ZnO_{2} planes and superconductivity is destroyed.

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized Zn doped Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{y}O_{12-\delta} (y=0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) superconductors, in which T_{c}(R\!=\!0) and the quantity of diamagnetism are enhanced with the increased Zn doping. These superconductors have tetragonal crystal structure and their c-axis length decreases with increased Zn concentration in the unit cell. The decreased c-axis length is also supported by the softening of apical oxygen phonon modes. The decreased c-axis length decreases volume of the unit cell which in turn increases the Fermi vector k_{F}\!=\!(3\,\pi^{2}N/V)^{1/3}, the coherence length along the c axis \xi_{c}\!=\!(\hbar k_{F}/2m\Delta), and the Fermi velocity v_{F}\!=\!(\pi\xi_{c}\Delta/\hbar) of the carriers,[67, 68] which ultimately lowers the anisotropy of the final compound. The enhanced \xi_{c} and v_{F} most likely enhance the T_{c}(R\!=\!0), magnitude of diamagnetism, and J_{c} in Zn doped samples. The postanemailing in oxygen has shown increased superconducting properties, which may possibly be arising from the optimization of carriers in ZnO_{2} planes. It is worth emphasizing that the charged carriers in case of Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{y}O_{12-\delta} superconductors are most likely supplied by the ratio of Cu^{+2}/Tl^{+3} in the Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}O_{4-\delta} charge reservoir layers. The presence of Cu^{+2} in the Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}O_{4-\delta} charge reservoir layers of Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu{

###### Abstract

A high temperature Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d (_y_ = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) superconductor with four ZnO2 planes is synthesized, in which the zero resistivity critical temperature [_Tc_(_R_ = 0)], the quantity of diamagnetism, and critical current density (_Jc_) are found to increase with enhanced Zn doping. From the x-ray diffraction studies, the _c_-axis lengths are found to decrease with increased Zn doping in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d The softening of apical oxygen modes observed in Fourier transform infrared absorption measurements has shown that the decreased _c_-axis length is among CuO2/ZnO2 planes. The decreased _c_-axis length increases the Fermi vector _kF_, the coherence length _k_c, and the superconductivity order parameter, which result into enhanced superconducting properties. The superconducting properties in these compounds were further enhanced by optimizing the carriers in CuO2/ZnO2 planes. The optimum numbers of carriers in these compounds were achieved by postannealing the samples in oxygen atmosphere.

## I Introduction

The substitution of impurity atoms in high _Tc_ cuprates (HTSCs) has been used as a probe for the study of underlying mechanism of superconductivity. [1-21] In previous studies, the magnetic impurities substituents such as Ni [1-2] at CuO2 planar sites and Co and Fe at the chain sites of the unit cell have been found to suppress the superconducting properties. [22-27] The doping of nonmagnetic impurity atoms such as Zn [1-2] the CuO2 planar sites has also been found to decrease the critical temperature [_Tc_(_R_ = 0)] in all the families of HTSCs. [1-27] The suppression of _Tc_ in anisotropic _d_-wave HTSCs with the doping of Zn [1-2] atoms at CuO2 planar sites was quite astonishing and suggested to be originating from the pair-breaking mechanism or electronic localization induced by dopant atoms. [28-51] In YBa2Cu3O7-d superconductor, [34] the localization of the carriers at Cu [1-2] atoms is in the immediate vicinity of Zn [1-2] atoms which was suggested to be one of the main root causes of depression of critical temperature. The suppression of superfluid density has also been observed in infrared conductivity experiments in Zn doped YBa2Cu4-Zn3O8 single crystals and a decrease of _Tc_(_R_ = 0) in part was suggested to be associated with the localization of carriers. [38] We have recently observed enhanced superconductivity by Zn doping in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d (_y_ = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) superconductors, which is quite contrary to all the previous studies on Zn doped cuprate HTSCs. In these Zn doped superconductors, we have also tried to explore the possibility of existence of localization of carriers at Cu [1-2] and /or Zn [1-2] sites by carrying out postannealing experiments in nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres. Through these studies, we have observed that there is no localization of the carriers to the Cu [1-2] or Zn [1-2] sites in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d superconductors. In the light of the present results, we have looked into the possible reasons for the suppression of superconductivity by Zn doping in all previous studies.

## II Experiment

The Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d (_y_ = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) samples were prepared by the solid state reaction method accomplished in two stages. At the first stage, Cu0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d precursor material was prepared by thoroughly mixing ZnO, Ba(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)2, and Cu(CN) in a quartz mortar and pestle in appropriate ratios. The mixed material was fired twice at 880 degC in a quartz boat for 24 h and furnace cooled to room temperature. At the second stage, the precursor material was ground for about an hour and mixed with Tl2O3 to give Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d as the final reactant composition. Thallium mixed material was pelletized under 3.8 tons/cm2 and the pellets were enclosed in a gold capsule. Gold capsule containing pellets were annealed for about 10 min at 880 degC followed by quenching to room temperature. The samples were characterized by resistivity, ac susceptibility, and critical current density measurements. The structure of the material was determined by x-ray diffraction scan from Rigaku D/Max IIIC using a Cu _K_a_ source with wavelength of 1.540 56 A and the cell parameters were determined by a cell refinement computer program. The phonon modes related to the vibrations of various oxygen atoms in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-yZn3O12-d unit cell were observed by Nicolet 5700 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer in the 400-650 cm-1 wave number range. The postannealing of the samples was carried out at 550 degC for 6 h. This temperature is chosen because oxygen intercalation into the unit cell is observed around this temperature regime. The oxygen content of the samples were determined by standard iodometric titration method. [52-54]

## III Results and Discussion

The x-ray diffraction scan of Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu1Zn3O12-d superconductor is shown in Fig. 1 in the inset of this figure, a decrease in the _c_-axis lengths with the increased Zn doping is shown. Most of the diffraction lines are fitted following the _P4/mmm_ space group and tetragonal structure. The decreased _c_-axis length with the increased Zn concentration shows an improved interplane coupling, which is consistent with previous studies carried out on Zn doped samples. [31] The effect of decreased c-axis length can also be seen in the form of softening of phonon modes [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60] of apical oxygen atoms in Zn doped Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.8}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{1-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} samples. In Zn-free samples (y=0), the phonon modes related to apical oxygen atoms [61, 62, 63, 64] of type Tl-O_{4}-Cu(2) and Cu(1)-O_{4}-Cu(2) are observed around 501 and 537 cm^{-1}, which are softened in all Zn doped samples to 453-455 and 514-524 cm^{-1}, respectively (Fig. 2). These two modes are of Tl-O_{4}-Cu(2)/Zn and Cu(1)-O_{4}-Cu(2)/Zn types. If the softening of these apical oxygen modes is linked with the decreased c-axis lengths observed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, then it becomes evident that the bond distances along the c axis are decreased between the CuO_{2}/ZnO_{2} planes. The planar mode of oxygen atoms in Zn free samples (y=0) is observed around 575 cm^{-1}, which is softened in Zn doped Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.8}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{1-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} samples to 572-565 cm^{-1}. The softening of planar oxygen mode is most likely arising from the increased mass of Zn (65.38 amu) with respect to Cu (63.546 amu).

The resistivity measurements of Zn doped Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.8}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} (y=0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) samples are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the magnitude of normal state resistivity decreases and T_{c}(_R_ =0) increases with the increased Zn concentration in Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.8}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} unit cell. The bulk superconductivity in the samples checked by ac susceptibility measurements are shown in Fig. 4; for a relative comparison of magnitude of diamagnetism in all Zn doped samples, we have normalized the ac signal to the mass of the sample. The onset of the superconductivity, magnitude of diamagnetism, and peak temperatures (T_{P}) observed in the out of phase component of magnetic ac susceptibility are found to increase systematically with the increased Zn doping in Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} samples (Fig. 5). T_{P} is related to H_{c} (critical magnetic field) and hence to the critical current density (J_{c}) of the samples [65, 66]. The increase in T_{p} with increased Zn doping suggested that J_{c} is enhanced with Zn doping, which is also observed in transport J_{c} measurements, as discussed in the next section. In the previous studies on Zn doped HTSC systems, T_{c}(_R_=0) and magnitude of diamagnetism are significantly suppressed by enhanced Zn^{+2} doping in the final compound. The localization of free carriers at Cu^{+2} sites in the neighborhood of Zn^{+2} atoms was suggested to be the main route cause of T_{c}(_R_=0) suppression in those studies. Those Cu^{+2} atoms having a localization of carriers in their neighborhoods behave as efficient scattering centers [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] which are absent altogether in our Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{3}O_{12-\delta} superconductors.

The possibility of existence of localization of carriers to the Cu^{+2} sites in the neighborhood of Zn^{+2} atoms, if present, could be enhanced by increasing and/or decreasing the carrier concentration in CuO_{2}/ZnO_{2} planes. In order to change the carrier concentration in CuO_{2}/ZnO_{2} planes, we have carried out postannealing experiments at 550 ^{\circ}C in oxygen, air, and nitrogen atmospheres. For such studies, we have chosen the samples without Zn (y=0) and with maximum Zn doping (y=3.5). T_{c}(_R_=0), T_{p}, I_{c}, and oxygen content for these experiments are summarized in Fig. 6. Since oxygen has the second highest electronegativity in the Periodic Table of elements, the intercalation of it in the Cu_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}Ba_{2}O_{4-\delta} charge reservoir layer can efficiently dope the charge carriers to conducting CuO_{2}/ZnO_{2} planes. The higher oxygen content

  in the charge reservoir layer decreases, whereas their lower concentration increases the electron density in conducting planes; the former enhances, while the later decreases the number of holes in ZnO2/CuO2 planes. T_{c}(_R_=0), T_{p}, I_{c}, and oxygen content of Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu4-,Zn3O12-_δ_ (y=0, 3.5) samples are increased after postannealing in oxygen, whereas these parameters are suppressed by postannealing in air and nitrogen atmospheres. The increased oxygen content in the samples after postannealing in oxygen led to a suggestion that the more intake of oxygen in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2O4-_δ_ charge reservoir layer brings the concentration of electrons in the conducting ZnO2/CuO2 planes to an optimum level, which consequently reduce the electron hole recombination processes at lower temperatures and an enhancement in the population of holes in conducting planes is promoted. The enhanced carrier's density in ZnO2/CuO2 planes promotes an increase in the Fermi vector k_{F}=(3\pi^{2}N/V)^{1/3}, the coherence length along the c axis \xi_{c}=(\hbar k_{F}/2m\Delta), and the Fermi velocity v_{F}=(\pi\xi_{c}\Delta/\hbar) of the carriers,[67, 68] which ultimately enhance the superconductivity parameters.

These self-doping experiments were performed to determine unequivocal evidence of the role played by doped carriers in ZnO2/CuO2 planes in the mechanism of superconductivity in these Zn doped compounds. As proposed in the previous studies that Zn doping promotes localization of carriers to the Cu+2 sites in the immediate vicinity of Zn+2 atoms. It was expected that increased hole concentration in ZnO2/CuO2 planes by the postannealing in oxygen would have enhanced such proposed localization processes. To our surprise, no such localization has been observed; otherwise, it would have killed the superconductivity; instead, it is enhanced. These experiments lead us to a conclusion that the role of the doped carriers in the conducting planes is primary and their localization at Cu+2/Zn+2 sites is absent altogether in our Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2Ca3Cu0.5Zn3.5O12-_δ_ superconductor. The decreased hole concentration as a result of postannealing in air and nitrogen makes the superconductor inferior but no localization of carrier is witnessed; otherwise, superconductivity would have been destroyed. These studies also suggested that the role of the ratio of divalent/trivalent (Cu+2/Pl+3) atoms in Cu0.5Tl0.5Ba2O4-_δ_ charge reservoir layer is primary in supplying the charge carriers to the CuO2/ZnO2 planes.

The question arises that why in the previous studies the superconductivity is suppressed by Zn doping in all cuprate HTSC systems?[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,  tween the CuO_{2} planes. The presence of trivalent ions, most likely localize the carriers in their neighborhood and their localization at the Cu^{+2} sites in the vicinity of Zn^{+2} atoms, as suggested in previous studies, is unlikely. These experiments have also shown that when 100% trivalent ions are present in the charge reservoir layers, it is most likely incapable of supplying carriers to the conducting ZnO_{2} planes and superconductivity is destroyed.

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized Zn doped Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{y}O_{12-\delta} (y=0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5) superconductors, in which T_{c}(R\!=\!0) and the quantity of diamagnetism are enhanced with the increased Zn doping. These superconductors have tetragonal crystal structure and their c-axis length decreases with increased Zn concentration in the unit cell. The decreased c-axis length is also supported by the softening of apical oxygen phonon modes. The decreased c-axis length decreases volume of the unit cell which in turn increases the Fermi vector k_{F}\!=\!(3\,\pi^{2}N/V)^{1/3}, the coherence length along the c axis \xi_{c}\!=\!(\hbar k_{F}/2m\Delta), and the Fermi velocity v_{F}\!=\!(\pi\xi_{c}\Delta/\hbar) of the carriers,[67, 68] which ultimately lowers the anisotropy of the final compound. The enhanced \xi_{c} and v_{F} most likely enhance the T_{c}(R\!=\!0), magnitude of diamagnetism, and J_{c} in Zn doped samples. The postanemailing in oxygen has shown increased superconducting properties, which may possibly be arising from the optimization of carriers in ZnO_{2} planes. It is worth emphasizing that the charged carriers in case of Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4-x}Zn_{y}O_{12-\delta} superconductors are most likely supplied by the ratio of Cu^{+2}/Tl^{+3} in the Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}O_{4-\delta} charge reservoir layers. The presence of Cu^{+2} in the Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}O_{4-\delta} charge reservoir layers of Cu_{0.5}Tl_{0.5}Ba_{2}Ca_{3}Cu{
