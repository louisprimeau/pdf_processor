2 April 200920028 May 20 The chemical composition was measured with a JEOL JSM-840 scanning electron microscope, same as that described in Ref. 9. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses indicated that less Cr was substituted in the crystal than put in solution; these results are summarized in Table 1. Three spots were checked on the surface of each single crystal, and no impurity phases were detected. The samples will be denoted by these measured values of x throughout this paper.

The phase purity of the crystals was characterized using a Scintag XDS 2000 powder x-ray diffractometer. Lattice constants were determined from full-pattern LeBail refinements using the program fullprof.11 At room temperature the structures are identified as the tetragonal ThCr2Si2 (_I_4/_mmm_, Z = 2). Table 1 gives the refined lattice constants from powder x-ray diffraction; Fig. 1 plots a and c parameters as a function of Cr concentration. The incorporation of x = 0.75 Cr in the Fe site increases the cell volume by 2.6%, mainly due to the increase in the c lattice constant. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction was also done at room temperature for x = 0.75. Analysis of the diffraction spots of the crystals indicated that there were multiple domains (plates with a preferred stacking) giving some smeared reflections. The refined lattice parameters are a = 3.985(3) and c = 13.277(17) A, similar to powder x-ray diffraction results (Table 1). Due to similarities between the Fe and Cr atomic scattering powers, the Fe/Cr ratios could not be refined.

Low-temperature single-crystal x-ray diffraction data was collected on the parent BaFe2As2. The crystal was placed under a stream of nitrogen gas and the data were collected on a Bruker Apex II diffractometer, first at 100 K. The refinement of the reflections gives the orthorhombic _F_-centered cell (_Fmmm_), as reported.5 The refined lattice parameters are a = 5.595(3) A, b = 5.610(3) A, and c = 12.964(6) A. The crystal was then warmed to 173 K; this structure was found to be tetragonal (_I_4/_mmm_) with lattice parameters of a = 3.9708(16) A and c = 13.006(5) A, as expected.

For small Cr-doping of x = 0.04, low-temperature structure was also examined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction (Table 2). A crystal was first examined at 100 K, then by warming to 117, 119, and finally 173 K. Surprisingly the 100 K structure refined in the tetragonal I4/_mmm_, with no sign of distortion. Shapes of several diffraction spots from 100 and 173 K were compared and they are almost identical. Also, the thermal ellipsoids are quite similar for 100 and 173 K in the I4/_mmm_. A small amount of chromium dopant seems to suppress a symmetry-breaking structural transition in BaFe2As2. If there is any distortion to a lower symmetry, it is relatively small and undetectable from the single-crystal data. Figure 2 shows the lattice constants as a function of temperature for x = 0.04. There is an indication that some structural change may happen below 119 K since both cell parameters decrease. High-resolution powder diffraction may reveal peak splitting (orthorhombic or another distortion) if present. If a symmetry lowering does not occur, the concomitant decrease in both a and c suggest that the structural transition may be volumetric in nature.

Magnetic measurements were performed with a Quantum Design (Magnetic Property Measurement System) superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. For a temperature-sweep experiment, the sample was cooled to 1.8 K in zero field (zfc) and data were collected by warming from 1.8 to 300 K in an applied field of 1 T. The magnetic-susceptibility results are presented per mole of formula unit (cm3/mol), _kh_, along _c_- and _ab_-crystallographic directions [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). For BaFe2As2 at room-temperature _khc_ = _khab_ = 6.5 x 10-4 cm3 mol-1, and the susceptibility decreases linearly with decreasing temperature, and drops abruptly below _T_N = 132 K with _khc_ > _khab_. With Cr doping, the magnitude of the magnetic susceptibility increases at room temperature while the transition for magnetic order (probably _T_N) decreases. At 1.8 K and for x \leq 0.14, _khc_ is approximately 1.2 times larger than _khab_. With more Cr

The susceptibilities along both crystallographic axes roughly converge and are isotropic above T_{N} = 118 K for x = 0.04, T_{N} = 104 K for x = 0.08, T_{N} = 88 K for x = 0.14, T_{N} = 80 K for x = 0.20, and T_{N} = 58 K for x = 0.36. For x = 0.75 and at ~120 K there is a drop in _x_c and a small kink in _xab_. For this sample there is also a broad feature at ~30 K in _xab_. For x = 0.75, the magnetic anisotropy switches, with _xab_/_x_c = 2 at 1.8 K. Figures 2(b) and 2(c) illustrate the field-dependent magnetization at 1.8 K. For samples with x \leq 0.20, the behavior is linear. For x = 0.36 (M_{b}) and x = 0.75 (M_{c}), there are nonlinearities in magnetization suggestive of metamagnetic transitions. These were not pursued any further here, but will be the subject of future investigations.

Transport measurements were performed with a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Electrical leads were attached to the sample using Dupont 4929 silver paste and resistivity measured in the _ab_ plane [Fig. 3(a)]. The r300 k values range from 0.3 to 0.8 m\Omega cm, although their absolute values may suffer from the geometry factor estimations. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity for BaFe_{2}As_{2} decreases with decreasing temperature, and below ~132 K there is a sharp drop. For x > 0, instead of a drop in r_{b}, there are sharp upturns below 117 K for x = 0.04, 104 K for x = 0.08, 90 K for x = 0.14, and 60 K for x = 0.36. The temperature of the anomaly is clearly diminished with increasing x, with no evidence of superconductivity down to 1.8 K. The resistivity for x = 0.75 sample is roughly temperature independent down to ~100 K, and rises below. The difference between the resistivity anomaly for x = 0 and those of 0.04 <= x \leq 0.36 is probably associated with changes in the scattering and the decrease in the number of carriers. For Cr-doped samples, no thermal hystereses were observed.

The Hall coefficient (_RH_) of BaFe_{2}As_{2} is negative in the temperature region of 125-145 K, and shows a sharp decrease at the structural/magnetic transition near 134 K.[13] For BaFe_{2-x}Cr_{x}As_{2} and x > 0, _RH_ was calculated from the antisymmetric part of the transverse voltage (perpendicular to the applied current) under magnetic field (+-6 T) reversal at fixed temperature. Systematic changes in _RH_(_T_) are observed upon Cr substitution [Fig. 3(b)]. For x = 0.04, _RH_ is negative between 30 and 300 K, and becomes more negative with decrease in temperature, with a sharp anomaly at ~120 K similar to BaFe_{2}As_{2}.[13]_RH_ gives a minimum near 90 K for x = 0.04, becoming less negative thereon and positive below 30 K. Qualitatively different behavior is observed at the phase transition for x > 0.04. For x = 0.08, x = 0.14, and x = 0.36, _RH_ displays an abrupt upturn upon cooling near 104, 90, and 60 K, respectively, and is approximately temperature independent at higher temperatures. These anomalies in _RH_ coincide with T_{N} observed in _x_(_T_) and anomalies observed in _r_(_T_). For x = 0.75, _RH_ is roughly temperature independent and positive down to 5 K. The positive values observed at low temperatures in the lightly doped materials and the tendency of _RH_ toward more positive values with x at higher temperatures are indications that Cr acts as a hole dopant in BaFe_{2}As_{2}. More detailed analysis of _RH_ is complicated by the multiband nature of the system and the likely presence of both electron and hole bands at the Fermi level.

Specific heat data were collected on single crystals [Fig. 4(a)], also using a PPMS. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, a transition is observed at 132(1) K, associated with a tetragonal to orthorhombic _Fmmm_ distortion, and a spin-density wave (SDW) magnetic transition.[4, 12 With Cr doping, the transition temperatures decrease. For x = 0.75, there are no anomalies in specific heat down to 1.8 K [Fig. 4(a), inset]. Figure 4(b) plots the _C_/_T_ versus _T_^{2} dependence up to ~10 K. Although this region is not very linear, the Sommerfeld-coefficient g may be estimated. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, g = 6.1 mJ/(K2 mol) [or 3.0 mJ/(K2 mol Fe)].[12] The g value increases consistently with Cr doping: g = 30 mJ/(K2 mol) for x = 0.14, g = 38 mJ/(K2 mol) for x = 0.20, 65.4 mJ/(K2 mol) for x

Having both \gamma and magnetic-susceptibility data, we may further estimate the Wilson ratio R_{w}=\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}\chi/(3\mu_{B}^{2}\gamma), assuming that \chi_{\rm spin}\,=\,\chi measured at 1.8 K. For x=0.14, R_{w} is \sim5 from \chi_{ab} and \sim6 from \chi_{c}. For x=0.20, R_{w} is \sim6 from \chi_{ab} and \sim8 from  clude an _A_-type AFM ground state. In any case, these results show that there is a very strong interplay between magnetism and chemical ordering in this material, and, based on sensitivity of the magnetic moments to the order, that the magnetism has a strong itinerant component. Finally, we note that the properties of BaFeCrAs_{2} (_x_ = 1) are very different from those of BaMn_{2}As_{2}, even though the electron count is the same. This is in contrast to the behavior seen in alloys with Fe, Co, and Ni.

We now discuss the ferromagnetic state of chemically ordered BaFeCrAs_{2} (_x_ = 1) in more detail. The calculated band structure, density of states (DOS) and Fermi surface are shown in Figs. 7-9, respectively. The band structure and Fermi surface show a clearly metallic state, with several bands crossing the Fermi energy, and large Fermi surfaces. Furthermore, in conjunction with the projected DOS, one may note a strong spin-dependent hybridization, both with As and between the Fe and Cr d orbitals. In particular, one may note that the majority-spin DOS shows very similar coherent shapes of the Fe and Cr contributions, while the minority spin does not. This formation of a coherent metallic majority-spin band structure generally leads to a reduction in band energy and explains why the ferromagnetic ordering is strongly favored. This basic mechanism is closely related to stabilization mechanism for the ferromagnetic metallic state in La rich alloys of (La,Ca)MnO_{3}, for example.[16] In any case, it also provides an explanation of why there is a strong

  interplay between chemical and magnetic order. Specifically, with checkerboard chemical order direct nearest-neighbor hopping can only take place between Fe and Cr atoms. This strongly favors a ferromagnetic state, as discussed. On the other hand, for stripelike chemical ordering, the strong covalency between Cr and As, noted previously,[10] provides a strong antiferromagnetic interaction between neighboring Cr atoms and works against a ferromagnetic state, and so an antiferromagnetic state emerges with strongly enhanced moments.

The majority-spin Fermi surface is dominated by two large electron cylinders running along the zone corner and shows additionally small three-dimensional electron sections centered at the Z points (0,0, and 1/2) and some very tiny electron sections. In contrast to the majority spin which is dominated by electron cylinders, the minority-spin Fermi surface shows a prominent multiband character, with a hole cylinder around the zone center and a large electron cylinder around the zone corner. In addition, there are three-dimensional hole pockets around the \Gamma point and additional tiny hole sections. The DOS at the Fermi energy, N(E_{F}) = 3.1 eV^{-1}/f.u. of which 29% comes from the majority spin and the remainder from the minority spin. This corresponds to a bare-band specific-heat \gamma=7.3 mJ/(K^{2} mole f.u.), i.e., 3.65 mJ/(K^{2} mole transition element). This is much less than measured values for our high Cr content samples, indicating a very strong mass renormalization. The calculated Fermi velocities in the ab-plane are 2.3\times 10^{5} m/s and 1.5 \times 10^{5} m/s for majority and minority spin, respectively, while the corresponding c-axis values are 1.2\times 10^{5} m/s and 0.9\times 10^{5} m/s. These numbers indicate a resistivity anisotropy \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\sim 3 to 4 depending on the scattering, which may be spin dependent in this material.

Finally, we note that in the Fe-based superconductors there is a general tendency for nonmagnetic LDA calculations to underestimate the height of the As above the Fe planes. This underestimation has been associated with spin fluctuations, which are important in these materials.[17] While it is unclear whether similar physics is applicable in the heavily Cr substituted compounds, we did repeat some of the calculations with the As height arbitrarily increased by 0.15 A. We find that the lowest-energy state with checkerboard chemical ordering remains ferromagnetic. The Cr moments are rather insensitive to the As height, while the Fe moments increase with As height similar to what was found previously in the pure Fe compounds.[17] In particular, for the lowest-energy ferromagnetic ordering, the Fe moments increase by 0.46\mu_{B} with a 0.15 A increase in As height.

To summarize the theoretical results, we find a strong interplay between chemical order and magnetic order, a sufficient energy difference between different chemically ordered supercells that we expect local chemical order, and therefore a ferromagnetic tendency in agreement with experiment, and a strong spin-dependent hybridization which may lead to an interesting interplay between transport and magnetic ordering, similar to colossal magnetoresistive manganites.

## III Conclusion

As chromium is introduced into FeAs layers in BaFe_{2-x}Cr_{x}As_{2}, T_{N} is suppressed while specific-heat \gamma increases. The enhanced susceptibilities at x=0.36 and x=75 levels imply that with increasing x, a ferromagnetic state may be approached. This is consistent with the ferromagnetic ground state that we find for the chemically ordered x=1. Considering the strong interplay between chemical order and itinerant magnetic order, as well as the strong spin-dependent hybridization that underlies this, one may expect (1) strong magnetic scattering both because of spin disorder connected with chemical disorder, and also due to spin fluctuations, and (2) the possibility of glassy magnetic behavior in material that is away from the x=1 chemical composition and also in material with partial chemical order. In this regard, it will be very interesting to explore the dependence of the properties on stoichiometry for higher Cr contents closer to the x=1 composition and also to perform annealing studies to investigate the interplay between magnetic order, transport and chemical order. The present results clearly show a competition between the SDW-type magnetism and another state that is ferromagnetic or very nearly ferromagnetic as Cr is introduced into BaFe_{2}As_{2}, as well as strong scattering and specific-heat renormalization in the regime where the magnetic crossover occurs. The theoretical results show that ordered BaFeCrAs_{2} is a rather unusual itinerant ferromagnetic metal with a strong spin-dependent hybridization and an interesting interplay between magnetic and chemical order.

For BaFe2As2 at room-temperature _khc_ = _khab_ = 6.5 x 10-4 cm3 mol-1, and the susceptibility decreases linearly with decreasing temperature, and drops abruptly below _T_N = 132 K with _khc_ > _khab_. With Cr doping, the magnitude of the magnetic susceptibility increases at room temperature while the transition for magnetic order (probably _T_N) decreases.

For samples with x \leq 0.20, the behavior is linear. For x = 0.36 (M_{b}) and x = 0.75 (M_{c}), there are nonlinearities in magnetization suggestive of metamagnetic transitions. These were not pursued any further here, but will be the subject of future investigations.

Transport measurements were performed with a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Electrical leads were attached to the sample using Dupont 4929 silver paste and resistivity measured in the _ab_ plane [Fig. 3(a)]. The r300 k values range from 0.3 to 0.8 m\Omega cm, although their absolute values may suffer from the geometry factor estimations. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity for BaFe_{2}As_{2} decreases with decreasing temperature, and below ~132 K there is a sharp drop. For x > 0, instead of a drop in r_{b}, there are sharp upturns below 117 K for x = 0.04, 104 K for x = 0.08, 90 K for x = 0.14, and 60 K for x = 0.36. The temperature of the anomaly is clearly diminished with increasing x, with no evidence of superconductivity down to 1.8 K. The resistivity for x = 0.75 sample is roughly temperature independent down to ~100 K, and rises below. The difference between the resistivity anomaly for x = 0 and those of 0.04 <= x \leq 0.36 is probably associated with changes in the scattering and the decrease in the number of carriers. For Cr-doped samples, no thermal hystereses were observed.

The Hall coefficient (_RH_) of BaFe_{2}As_{2} is negative in the temperature region of 125-145 K, and shows a sharp decrease at the structural/magnetic transition near 134 K.[13] For BaFe_{2-x}Cr_{x}As_{2} and x > 0, _RH_ was calculated from the antisymmetric part of the transverse voltage (perpendicular to the applied current) under magnetic field (+-6 T) reversal at fixed temperature. Systematic changes in _RH_(_T_) are observed upon Cr substitution [Fig. 3(b)]. For x = 0.04, _RH_ is negative between 30 and 300 K, and becomes more negative with decrease in temperature, with a sharp anomaly at ~120 K similar to BaFe_{2}As_{2}.[13]_RH_ gives a minimum near 90 K for x = 0.04, becoming less negative thereon and positive below 30 K. Qualitatively different behavior is observed at the phase transition for x > 0.04. For x = 0.08, x = 0.14, and x = 0.36, _RH_ displays an abrupt upturn upon cooling near 104, 90, and 60 K, respectively, and is approximately temperature independent at higher temperatures. These anomalies in _RH_ coincide with T_{N} observed in _x_(_T_) and anomalies observed in _r_(_T_). For x = 0.75, _RH_ is roughly temperature independent and positive down to 5 K. The positive values observed at low temperatures in the lightly doped materials and the tendency of _RH_ toward more positive values with x at higher temperatures are indications that Cr acts as a hole dopant in BaFe_{2}As_{2}. More detailed analysis of _RH_ is complicated by the multiband nature of the system and the likely presence of both electron and hole bands at the Fermi level.

Specific heat data were collected on single crystals [Fig. 4(a)], also using a PPMS. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, a transition is observed at 132(1) K, associated with a tetragonal to orthorhombic _Fmmm_ distortion, and a spin-density wave (SDW) magnetic transition.[4, 12 With Cr doping, the transition temperatures decrease. For x = 0.75, there are no anomalies in specific heat down to 1.8 K [Fig. 4(a), inset]. Figure 4(b) plots the _C_/_T_ versus _T_^{2} dependence up to ~10 K. Although this region is not very linear, the Sommerfeld-coefficient g may be estimated. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, g = 6.1 mJ/(K2 mol) [or 3.0 mJ/(K2 mol Fe)].[12] The g value increases consistently with Cr doping: g = 30 mJ/(K2 mol) for x = 0.14, g = 38 mJ/(K2 mol) for x = 0.20, 65.4 mJ/(K2 mol) for x

Having both \gamma and magnetic-susceptibility data, we may further estimate the Wilson ratio R_{w}=\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}\chi/(3\mu_{B}^{2}\gamma), assuming that \chi_{\rm spin}\,=\,\chi measured at 1.8 K. For x=0.14, R_{w} is \sim5 from \chi_{ab} and \sim6 from \chi_{c}. For x=0.20, R_{w} is \sim6 from \chi_{ab} and \sim8 from  clude an _A_-type AFM ground state. In any case, these results show that there is a very strong interplay between magnetism and chemical ordering in this material, and, based on sensitivity of the magnetic moments to the order, that the magnetism has a strong itinerant component. Finally, we note that the properties of BaFeCrAs_{2} (_x_ = 1) are very different from those of BaMn_{2}As_{2}, even though the electron count is the same. This is in contrast to the behavior seen in alloys with Fe, Co, and Ni.

We now discuss the ferromagnetic state of chemically ordered BaFeCrAs_{2} (_x_ = 1) in more detail. The calculated band structure, density of states (DOS) and Fermi surface are shown in Figs. 7-9, respectively. The band structure and Fermi surface show a clearly metallic state, with several bands crossing the Fermi energy, and large Fermi surfaces. Furthermore, in conjunction with the projected DOS, one may note a strong spin-dependent hybridization, both with As and between the Fe and Cr d orbitals. In particular, one may note that the majority-spin DOS shows very similar coherent shapes of the Fe and Cr contributions, while the minority spin does not. This formation of a coherent metallic majority-spin band structure generally leads to a reduction in band energy and explains why the ferromagnetic ordering is strongly favored. This basic mechanism is closely related to stabilization mechanism for the ferromagnetic metallic state in La rich alloys of (La,Ca)MnO_{3}, for example.[16] In any case, it also provides an explanation of why there is a strong

  interplay between chemical and magnetic order. Specifically, with checkerboard chemical order direct nearest-neighbor hopping can only take place between Fe and Cr atoms. This strongly favors a ferromagnetic state, as discussed. On the other hand, for stripelike chemical ordering, the strong covalency between Cr and As, noted previously,[10] provides a strong antiferromagnetic interaction between neighboring Cr atoms and works against a ferromagnetic state, and so an antiferromagnetic state emerges with strongly enhanced moments.

The majority-spin Fermi surface is dominated by two large electron cylinders running along the zone corner and shows additionally small three-dimensional electron sections centered at the Z points (0,0, and 1/2) and some very tiny electron sections. In contrast to the majority spin which is dominated by electron cylinders, the minority-spin Fermi surface shows a prominent multiband character, with a hole cylinder around the zone center and a large electron cylinder around the zone corner. In addition, there are three-dimensional hole pockets around the \Gamma point and additional tiny hole sections. The DOS at the Fermi energy, N(E_{F}) = 3.1 eV^{-1}/f.u. of which 29% comes from the majority spin and the remainder from the minority spin. This corresponds to a bare-band specific-heat \gamma=7.3 mJ/(K^{2} mole f.u.), i.e., 3.65 mJ/(K^{2} mole transition element). This is much less than measured values for our high Cr content samples, indicating a very strong mass renormalization. The calculated Fermi velocities in the ab-plane are 2.3\times 10^{5} m/s and 1.5 \times 10^{5} m/s for majority and minority spin, respectively, while the corresponding c-axis values are 1.2\times 10^{5} m/s and 0.9\times 10^{5} m/s. These numbers indicate a resistivity anisotropy \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\sim 3 to 4 depending on the scattering, which may be spin dependent in this material.

Finally, we note that in the Fe-based superconductors there is a general tendency for nonmagnetic LDA calculations to underestimate the height of the As above the Fe planes. This underestimation has been associated with spin fluctuations, which are important in these materials.[17] While it is unclear whether similar physics is applicable in the heavily Cr substituted compounds, we did repeat some of the calculations with the As height arbitrarily increased by 0.15 A. We find that the lowest-energy state with checkerboard chemical ordering remains ferromagnetic. The Cr moments are rather insensitive to the As height, while the Fe moments increase with As height similar to what was found previously in the pure Fe compounds.[17] In particular, for the lowest-energy ferromagnetic ordering, the Fe moments increase by 0.46\mu_{B} with a 0.15 A increase in As height.

To summarize the theoretical results, we find a strong interplay between chemical order and magnetic order, a sufficient energy difference between different chemically ordered supercells that we expect local chemical order, and therefore a ferromagnetic tendency in agreement with experiment, and a strong spin-dependent hybridization which may lead to an interesting interplay between transport and magnetic ordering, similar to colossal magnetoresistive manganites.

## III Conclusion

As chromium is introduced into FeAs layers in BaFe_{2-x}Cr_{x}As_{2}, T_{N} is suppressed while specific-heat \gamma increases. The enhanced susceptibilities at x=0.36 and x=75 levels imply that with increasing x, a ferromagnetic state may be approached. This is consistent with the ferromagnetic ground state that we find for the chemically ordered x=1. Considering the strong interplay between chemical order and itinerant magnetic order, as well as the strong spin-dependent hybridization that underlies this, one may expect (1) strong magnetic scattering both because of spin disorder connected with chemical disorder, and also due to spin fluctuations, and (2) the possibility of glassy magnetic behavior in material that is away from the x=1 chemical composition and also in material with partial chemical order. In this regard, it will be very interesting to explore the dependence of the properties on stoichiometry for higher Cr contents closer to the x=1 composition and also to perform annealing studies to investigate the interplay between magnetic order, transport and chemical order. The present results clearly show a competition between the SDW-type magnetism and another state that is ferromagnetic or very nearly ferromagnetic as Cr is introduced into BaFe_{2}As_{2}, as well as strong scattering and specific-heat renormalization in the regime where the magnetic crossover occurs. The theoretical results show that ordered BaFeCrAs_{2} is a rather unusual itinerant ferromagnetic metal with a strong spin-dependent hybridization and an interesting interplay between magnetic and chemical order.
