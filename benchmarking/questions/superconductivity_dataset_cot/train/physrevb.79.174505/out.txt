###### Abstract

We have studied Ni-substitution effect in LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO (0 \leq x \leq 0.1) by the measurements of x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity. The nickel doping drastically suppresses the resistivity anomaly associated with spin-density-wave ordering in the parent compound. Superconductivity emerges in a narrow region of 0.03 \leq x \leq 0.06 with the maximum _T_{c}_ of 6.5 K at x =0.04, where enhanced magnetic susceptibility shows up. The upper critical field at zero temperature is estimated to exceed the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The much lowered _T_{c}_ in comparison with LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system is discussed.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (Ref. [1]) and the subsequent findings of the enhanced superconductivity with _T_{c}_ up to 56 K (Refs. [2; 3; 4; 5]) in a series of iron-arsenides have stimulated enormous research interest. It has been suggested that both electronic correlations and multiorbital/band effects should play important roles. [6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12] The prototype parent compound, LaFeAsO, undergoes a structural phase transition at 155 K, [13; 14] followed by a collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-density-wave (SDW) transition at lower temperature. [13; 15] Electron/hole doping into the FeAs layers suppresses the long-range SDW order, in favor of superconductivity. [15; 16] This phenomenon is apparently analogous to that in cuprates, where superconductivity is induced by doping of charge carriers into an AFM Mott insulator. The iron arsenides, however, also show remarkable differences from the cuprates. For example, the parent compounds of iron arsenides show itinerant character of Fe 3d electrons, [17; 18; 19; 20] while Cu 3d electrons in the parent compounds of the cuprates are localized.

As inferred in the band structure calculations for LaOMAs As (_M_ = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni), [21]_Fe-site doping_ with Co or Ni in the parent compounds of iron arsenides may also introduce additional electrons, hence possibly inducing superconductivity. This has been experimentally realized for the Co doping with _T_{c}_ \sim 13 K in LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO (Refs. [22] and [23]) and _T_{c}_ = 22 K in BaFe_{1.8}Co_{0.23}. [24] Since Ni atoms have one more electron than Co, one would expect that substitution of Fe with Ni introduces carriers more effectively. A possible hint comes from the Ni-based arsenide analog, LaNiAsO, which is a superconductor with _T_{c}_ \sim 2.5 K. [25; 26] The normal state of the LaNiAsO superconductor is Pauli paramagnetic, [26] suggesting that the Ni 3d electrons have an itinerant character.

In this paper we report the realization of superconductivity in LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO(0 \leq x \leq 0.1). Superconductivity has been observed in a narrow region of 0.03 \leq x \leq 0.06 with a lowered maximum _T_{c}_ of 6.5 K. The optimal doping level is found to be about half of that in LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO (Ref. [23]) system. The occurrence of superconductivity by Ni doping at Fe site contrasts sharply with severe suppression of superconductivity by the Cu-site doping with Ni in cuprate superconductors.

## II Experimental

Polycrystalline LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO samples were synthesized by solid state reaction in vacuum, similar to previous report. [23] Powders of LaAs, La_{2}O_{3}, FeAs, Fe_{2}As and NiO were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratios of LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO (_x_ =0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1), and thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar and pressed into pellets under a pressure of 2000 kg/cm^{2}. The pellets were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, then heated uniformly at 1433 K for 48 h, and finally cooled by shutting off the furnace.

The resultant samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu _K\alpha_ radiation. The XRD diffractometer system was calibrated using standard Si powders. The detailed structural parameters were obtained by Rietveld refinements, using the step-scan XRD data with 10^{\circ} \leq 2 \theta \leq 120^{\circ}. The typical R values of the refinements are: _R_{\rm F}_ \sim 2.8%, _R_{1}_ \sim 4.6%, and _R_{\rm{wp}}_ \sim 13%. The goodness-of-fit parameter, S = _R_{\rm{wp}}_/_R_{\rm{exp}}_ \sim 1.6, indicating good reliability of the refinement.

The electrical resistivity was measured with a standard four-terminal method. Samples were cut into a thin bar with typical size of 4 \times 2 \times 0.5 mm^{3}. Gold wires were attached onto the samples' abraded surface with silver paint. The size of the contact pads leads to a total uncertainty in the absolute values of resistivity of 10%. The measurements of magnetoresistance and heat capacity were carried out on a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS-9). Temperature dependence of magnetization was measured on a Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS). In the measurements of normal-state susceptibility, the background data from the sample holder were removed. For the measurement of the superconducting (SC) transitions, both the zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) protocols were employed under the field of 10 Oe.

 

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) shows XRD patterns of the representative samples of LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO. The XRD peaks are well indexed based on a tetragonal cell with the space group of P4/_nmm_, indicating that the samples are essentially single phase. The lattice parameters are plotted in the inset as functions of x. With the increase in Ni doping the a axis increases slightly, while the c axis shrinks remarkably. The cell volume is consequently decreased by the incorporation of Ni.

The crystallographic parameters were obtained by the Rietveld refinement [Fig. 1(b)] based on ZrCuSiAs-type structure. Table 1 compares the structural data of undoped and Ni-doped (by 4 at. %) samples. The Ni doping enlarges the Fe-Fe spacing slightly, but compresses the FeAs layers significantly. In other word, the most remarkable effect of Ni doping on the crystal structure is that As atoms are pulled toward the Fe planes.

Figure 2 shows temperature dependence of resistivity (\rho) in LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO. The parent compound shows a resistivity anomaly below 155 K. This resistivity anomaly has been identified as due to a structural phase transition associated with SDW instability.[13, 14, 15, 27] Upon doping with 1% and 2% Ni, the anomaly temperature T_{\text{anom}} is suppressed to 105 and 75 K, respectively. As x increases to 0.03, a tiny anomaly in \rho can be detectable at 50 K, meanwhile the resistivity drops to zero below 5.5 K, suggesting emergence of superconductivity. The SC transition temperatures are 6.5 and 3.4 K for the samples of x = 0.04 and 0.05, respectively, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2.

Figure 3 shows SC diamagnetic transitions in LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO. Although samples with x \leq 0.02 show no diamagnetic signal above 1.8 K, magnetic expelling/screening can be clearly seen for 0.03 \leq x \leq 0.06 at low temperatures. The magnetic shielding fraction of the sample of x = 0.04 is estimated to be 45%, confirming bulk superconductivity. The diamagnetic curve shows steplike feature, probably due to sample inhomogeneity and/or an intergrain SC transition. The diamagnetic signal for other SC samples is much lower, implying that the SC region would be even narrower if samples were homogeneous. Similar phenomena were also observed in LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO systems.[22, 23]

To verify bulk superconductivity further, we performed specific-heat (_C_) measurement for the sample of x = 0.04. The result is shown in Fig. 4. A specific-heat anomaly can be seen at T_{c}\sim 6.5 K (a tiny anomaly at about 8 K might be related to the trace residual SDW transition). In the temperature range from 6.7 to 10 K, the specific heat can be well described by the sum of electronic and lattice contributions: C = _g_T_ + _bT_3. Therefore, the linear fit for _C_/_T_ versus T2 gives the electronic specific-heat coefficient g = 5.74 mJ/(mol K^{2}) and the lattice specific-heat coefficient b = 0.254 mJ/(mol K^{4}). The Debye temperature \theta_{\text{D}} is then calculated to be 285 K, using the formula \theta_{\text{D}}=(12\pi_RN_/_S_b_1)3, where N = 4 and R = 8.314 J/(mol K). The value of \theta_{\text{D}} is close to that of LaFeAsO (282 K, Ref. [15]) and that of LaFeAsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} (308 K, Ref. [28]). The value of g is also comparable to those of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples (Refs. [15] and [28]).

 After subtracting the lattice contribution to the specific heat, the specific-heat jump at the SC transition can be obviously seen, confirming bulk superconductivity. The dimensionless parameter \Delta C_{e}/\gamma T at T_{c} is estimated to be 0.73, much lower than the expected value of 1.43 for an isotropic SC gap. This observation is similar to that in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}.[28] One may also see two transitions at 5 and 6.5 K, in accordance with the above steplike diamagnetic susceptibility curve. This phenomenon is probably due to the sample inhomogeneity and/or intergrain SC transition as mentioned above, however, the possibility of multiband superconductivity cannot be fully ruled out.

Figure 5 shows suppression of SC transition in resistivity under magnetic fields for the sample of x=0.04. The applied field shifts the SC transition toward lower temperatures, and the transition becomes broadened. The inset plots the temperature dependence of T_{c} (H), defined as the temperature where the resistivity falls to one-half of the normal-state value. The initial slope \mu_{0}\partial H_{c2}/\partial T near T_{c} is -3.81 T/K, which leads to an estimated upper critical field at zero-field \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)\sim 17 T using Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model (Ref. [29]). This value of upper critical field exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit \mu_{0}H_{p}=1.84T_{c}\sim 12 T (Ref. [30]). Similar observations have been reported in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system.[31, 32] The high critical field makes LaFe_{0.96}Ni_{0.04}AsO fundamentally different from the LaFeNiO superconductor (Refs. [25] and [26]).

The normal-state susceptibility \chi of the Ni-doped samples is shown in Fig. 6. The \chi(T) are characterized by linear decrease at high temperatures as well as Curie-like upturn below \sim100 K. The Curie-like upturn was found to be sensitive to sample's quality. Generally, better sample shows smaller susceptibility upturn. Thus, the susceptibility upturn is mainly due to an extrinsic origin (such as defects and trace impurities). The linear T-dependence of \chi was experimentally demonstrated in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (Ref. [33]) and BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [34]) systems, and was discussed in terms of the "preformed SDW moments".[35] The measured \chi(T) can thus be fitted with the formula,

\[\chi(T)=\chi_{0}+\alpha T+\frac{C}{T},\] (1)

where the T-independent term \chi_{0} contains Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility (\chi_{\rm p}) (Ref. [36]) from itinerant electrons

  and Larmor diamagnetic susceptibility (\chi_{\rm core}) from ionic cores. It is noted that the change in \chi_{0} with the Ni doping is primarily due to the variation of \chi_{\rm P}.

To avoid the influence of the structural transition for 0 \leq x\leq 0.02, we made the fitting using different range of data as follows: 160 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x=0, 110 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x=0.01, 75 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x=0.02, 50 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x=0.03, and 30 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x> 0  LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO (see Table 3). The normal state is divided by the line of T^{*} into metallic and semiconducting regions. The "optimal" doping occurs at x_{\rm opt}=0.04, which is about half of the x_{\rm opt} of LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO. This observation further demonstrates the itinerant character of Ni 3d electrons. Here we emphasize that the occurrence of superconductivity by Ni doping contrasts sharply with the cuprate superconductors, where the substitution of Cu with Ni in CuO_{2} planes severely destroys the superconductivity [43].

###### Abstract

We have studied Ni-substitution effect in LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO (0 \leq x \leq 0.1) by the measurements of x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity. The nickel doping drastically suppresses the resistivity anomaly associated with spin-density-wave ordering in the parent compound. Superconductivity emerges in a narrow region of 0.03 \leq x \leq 0.06 with the maximum _T_{c}_ of 6.5 K at x =0.04, where enhanced magnetic susceptibility shows up. The upper critical field at zero temperature is estimated to exceed the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The much lowered _T_{c}_ in comparison with LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system is discussed.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (Ref. [1]) and the subsequent findings of the enhanced superconductivity with _T_{c}_ up to 56 K (Refs. [2; 3; 4; 5]) in a series of iron-arsenides have stimulated enormous research interest. It has been suggested that both electronic correlations and multiorbital/band effects should play important roles. [6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12] The prototype parent compound, LaFeAsO, undergoes a structural phase transition at 155 K, [13; 14] followed by a collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-density-wave (SDW) transition at lower temperature. [13; 15] Electron/hole doping into the FeAs layers suppresses the long-range SDW order, in favor of superconductivity. [15; 16] This phenomenon is apparently analogous to that in cuprates, where superconductivity is induced by doping of charge carriers into an AFM Mott insulator. The iron arsenides, however, also show remarkable differences from the cuprates. For example, the parent compounds of iron arsenides show itinerant character of Fe 3d electrons, [17; 18; 19; 20] while Cu 3d electrons in the parent compounds of the cuprates are localized.

As inferred in the band structure calculations for LaOMAs As (_M_ = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni), [21]_Fe-site doping_ with Co or Ni in the parent compounds of iron arsenides may also introduce additional electrons, hence possibly inducing superconductivity. This has been experimentally realized for the Co doping with _T_{c}_ \sim 13 K in LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO (Refs. [22] and [23]) and _T_{c}_ = 22 K in BaFe_{1.8}Co_{0.23}. [24] Since Ni atoms have one more electron than Co, one would expect that substitution of Fe with Ni introduces carriers more effectively. A possible hint comes from the Ni-based arsenide analog, LaNiAsO, which is a superconductor with _T_{c}_ \sim 2.5 K. [25; 26] The normal state of the LaNiAsO superconductor is Pauli paramagnetic, [26] suggesting that the Ni 3d electrons have an itinerant character.

In this paper we report the realization of superconductivity in LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO(0 \leq x \leq 0.1). Superconductivity has been observed in a narrow region of 0.03 \leq x \leq 0.06 with a lowered maximum _T_{c}_ of 6.5 K. The optimal doping level is found to be about half of that in LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO (Ref. [23]) system. The occurrence of superconductivity by Ni doping at Fe site contrasts sharply with severe suppression of superconductivity by the Cu-site doping with Ni in cuprate superconductors.

## II Experimental

Polycrystalline LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO samples were synthesized by solid state reaction in vacuum, similar to previous report. [23] Powders of LaAs, La_{2}O_{3}, FeAs, Fe_{2}As and NiO were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratios of LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO (_x_ =0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1), and thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar and pressed into pellets under a pressure of 2000 kg/cm^{2}. The pellets were sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, then heated uniformly at 1433 K for 48 h, and finally cooled by shutting off the furnace.

The resultant samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu _K\alpha_ radiation. The XRD diffractometer system was calibrated using standard Si powders. The detailed structural parameters were obtained by Rietveld refinements, using the step-scan XRD data with 10^{\circ} \leq 2 \theta \leq 120^{\circ}. The typical R values of the refinements are: _R_{\rm F}_ \sim 2.8%, _R_{1}_ \sim 4.6%, and _R_{\rm{wp}}_ \sim 13%. The goodness-of-fit parameter, S = _R_{\rm{wp}}_/_R_{\rm{exp}}_ \sim 1.6, indicating good reliability of the refinement.

The electrical resistivity was measured with a standard four-terminal method. Samples were cut into a thin bar with typical size of 4 \times 2 \times 0.5 mm^{3}. Gold wires were attached onto the samples' abraded surface with silver paint. The size of the contact pads leads to a total uncertainty in the absolute values of resistivity of 10%. The measurements of magnetoresistance and heat capacity were carried out on a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS-9). Temperature dependence of magnetization was measured on a Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS). In the measurements of normal-state susceptibility, the background data from the sample holder were removed. For the measurement of the superconducting (SC) transitions, both the zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) protocols were employed under the field of 10 Oe.

 

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) shows XRD patterns of the representative samples of LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO. The XRD peaks are well indexed based on a tetragonal cell with the space group of P4/_nmm_, indicating that the samples are essentially single phase. The lattice parameters are plotted in the inset as functions of x. With the increase in Ni doping the a axis increases slightly, while the c axis shrinks remarkably. The cell volume is consequently decreased by the incorporation of Ni.

The crystallographic parameters were obtained by the Rietveld refinement [Fig. 1(b)] based on ZrCuSiAs-type structure. Table 1 compares the structural data of undoped and Ni-doped (by 4 at. %) samples. The Ni doping enlarges the Fe-Fe spacing slightly, but compresses the FeAs layers significantly. In other word, the most remarkable effect of Ni doping on the crystal structure is that As atoms are pulled toward the Fe planes.

Figure 2 shows temperature dependence of resistivity (\rho) in LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO. The parent compound shows a resistivity anomaly below 155 K. This resistivity anomaly has been identified as due to a structural phase transition associated with SDW instability.[13, 14, 15, 27] Upon doping with 1% and 2% Ni, the anomaly temperature T_{\text{anom}} is suppressed to 105 and 75 K, respectively. As x increases to 0.03, a tiny anomaly in \rho can be detectable at 50 K, meanwhile the resistivity drops to zero below 5.5 K, suggesting emergence of superconductivity. The SC transition temperatures are 6.5 and 3.4 K for the samples of x = 0.04 and 0.05, respectively, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2.

Figure 3 shows SC diamagnetic transitions in LaFe_{1-x}Ni_{x}AsO. Although samples with x \leq 0.02 show no diamagnetic signal above 1.8 K, magnetic expelling/screening can be clearly seen for 0.03 \leq x \leq 0.06 at low temperatures. The magnetic shielding fraction of the sample of x = 0.04 is estimated to be 45%, confirming bulk superconductivity. The diamagnetic curve shows steplike feature, probably due to sample inhomogeneity and/or an intergrain SC transition. The diamagnetic signal for other SC samples is much lower, implying that the SC region would be even narrower if samples were homogeneous. Similar phenomena were also observed in LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO systems.[22, 23]

To verify bulk superconductivity further, we performed specific-heat (_C_) measurement for the sample of x = 0.04. The result is shown in Fig. 4. A specific-heat anomaly can be seen at T_{c}\sim 6.5 K (a tiny anomaly at about 8 K might be related to the trace residual SDW transition). In the temperature range from 6.7 to 10 K, the specific heat can be well described by the sum of electronic and lattice contributions: C = _g_T_ + _bT_3. Therefore, the linear fit for _C_/_T_ versus T2 gives the electronic specific-heat coefficient g = 5.74 mJ/(mol K^{2}) and the lattice specific-heat coefficient b = 0.254 mJ/(mol K^{4}). The Debye temperature \theta_{\text{D}} is then calculated to be 285 K, using the formula \theta_{\text{D}}=(12\pi_RN_/_S_b_1)3, where N = 4 and R = 8.314 J/(mol K). The value of \theta_{\text{D}} is close to that of LaFeAsO (282 K, Ref. [15]) and that of LaFeAsO_{0.89}F_{0.11} (308 K, Ref. [28]). The value of g is also comparable to those of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} samples (Refs. [15] and [28]).

 After subtracting the lattice contribution to the specific heat, the specific-heat jump at the SC transition can be obviously seen, confirming bulk superconductivity. The dimensionless parameter \Delta C_{e}/\gamma T at T_{c} is estimated to be 0.73, much lower than the expected value of 1.43 for an isotropic SC gap. This observation is similar to that in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}.[28] One may also see two transitions at 5 and 6.5 K, in accordance with the above steplike diamagnetic susceptibility curve. This phenomenon is probably due to the sample inhomogeneity and/or intergrain SC transition as mentioned above, however, the possibility of multiband superconductivity cannot be fully ruled out.

Figure 5 shows suppression of SC transition in resistivity under magnetic fields for the sample of x=0.04. The applied field shifts the SC transition toward lower temperatures, and the transition becomes broadened. The inset plots the temperature dependence of T_{c} (H), defined as the temperature where the resistivity falls to one-half of the normal-state value. The initial slope \mu_{0}\partial H_{c2}/\partial T near T_{c} is -3.81 T/K, which leads to an estimated upper critical field at zero-field \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)\sim 17 T using Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model (Ref. [29]). This value of upper critical field exceeds the Pauli paramagnetic limit \mu_{0}H_{p}=1.84T_{c}\sim 12 T (Ref. [30]). Similar observations have been reported in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} system.[31, 32] The high critical field makes LaFe_{0.96}Ni_{0.04}AsO fundamentally different from the LaFeNiO superconductor (Refs. [25] and [26]).

The normal-state susceptibility \chi of the Ni-doped samples is shown in Fig. 6. The \chi(T) are characterized by linear decrease at high temperatures as well as Curie-like upturn below \sim100 K. The Curie-like upturn was found to be sensitive to sample's quality. Generally, better sample shows smaller susceptibility upturn. Thus, the susceptibility upturn is mainly due to an extrinsic origin (such as defects and trace impurities). The linear T-dependence of \chi was experimentally demonstrated in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (Ref. [33]) and BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [34]) systems, and was discussed in terms of the "preformed SDW moments".[35] The measured \chi(T) can thus be fitted with the formula,

\[\chi(T)=\chi_{0}+\alpha T+\frac{C}{T},\] (1)

where the T-independent term \chi_{0} contains Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility (\chi_{\rm p}) (Ref. [36]) from itinerant electrons

  and Larmor diamagnetic susceptibility (\chi_{\rm core}) from ionic cores. It is noted that the change in \chi_{0} with the Ni doping is primarily due to the variation of \chi_{\rm P}.

To avoid the influence of the structural transition for 0 \leq x\leq 0.02, we made the fitting using different range of data as follows: 160 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x=0, 110 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x=0.01, 75 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x=0.02, 50 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x=0.03, and 30 K \leq T\leq 300 K for x> 0  LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO (see Table 3). The normal state is divided by the line of T^{*} into metallic and semiconducting regions. The "optimal" doping occurs at x_{\rm opt}=0.04, which is about half of the x_{\rm opt} of LaFe_{1-x}Co_{x}AsO. This observation further demonstrates the itinerant character of Ni 3d electrons. Here we emphasize that the occurrence of superconductivity by Ni doping contrasts sharply with the cuprate superconductors, where the substitution of Cu with Ni in CuO_{2} planes severely destroys the superconductivity [43].
