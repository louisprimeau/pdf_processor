###### Abstract

We report the observation of superconductivity in homogeneously disordered thick films of amorphous Mg_{x}B_{1-x} with x = 0.29-0.39. We find that the superconducting-transition temperature T_{c} changes smoothly as a function of x, exhibiting a peak (T_{c} \approx 6.1 K) at x \approx 0.33 (=x_{p}). Seven films studied in this work are classified into two groups. For films with x < x_{p} the slope of the critical field B_{0}(T) where the dc resistivity vanishes is larger than that for films with x \approx x_{p}, indicating that there is a difference in the electronic and/or vortex states between the two groups.

Since the discovery of superconductivity in MgB_{2} at about 39 K,[1] much effort has been devoted to fabricating high-quality crystals. To date, films with a highly c-axis-oriented crystal structure,[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] as well as bulk single crystals,[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have been fabricated. These samples are considered to be sufficiently clean, having the low resistivity in the normal state at 40 K (\rho_{n}\sim 0.1-10 \mu\Omega cm). However, the superconducting properties, as well as the values of \rho_{n}, are dependent on preparation methods. The superconducting-transition temperature T_{c} for the crystal samples stays close to 39 K, while somewhat lower values of T_{c} (\sim 22-39 K) have been reported for the film samples.[15, 16] The upper critical field B_{c2}(0) in the limit of zero temperature (T\rightarrow0) ranges from \sim 4 T for single crystals, where the field is applied perpendicular to the Mg and B planes, to 15 T for wires and polycrystallines. On the basis of data of dc resistivity and magnetic measurements, the possible vortex phase diagram in the field-temperature (B-T) plane has been actively discussed. One of the most striking features is the extremely broad "vortex-liquid phase" which grows progressively with decreasing temperature.

Compared with clean samples, very little has been studied about the dirty samples.[16, 17, 18] It is interesting to study amorphous (a-)Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films where disorder is microscopic and extremely strong. Of course it is not evident whether we can fabricate a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films, and even if we can fabricate them, it is not clear whether they exhibit superconductivity. To date, several amorphous alloy films are known to exhibit superconductivity.[19, 20, 21, 22] For instance, in molybdenum-base a-Mo_{x}Ge_{1-x} (Ref. [20]) and a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films, T_{c} is varied as a function of x. Mo is itself a superconductor with a bulk T_{c} of 0.9 K, while T_{c}'s of these amorphous alloy films are much higher than 1 K for moderate Mo concentration x: e.g., T_{c} of the 100-nm-thick a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films reaches 7 K for x = 0.7.[19]

In this paper we report the observation of superconductivity in thick a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films with varying x. The a-MgB_{2} films which exhibit superconductivity have been already reported by Kus _et al.[16]_ However, the preparation method and superconducting properties are very different from those in the present study, suggesting that the microscopic or mesoscopic structure of the films is also different. The films reported on in Ref. [16] were deposited on flexible plastic substrates and subsequently heated to approximately 600 ^{\circ}C. The onset temperature of the superconducting transition was about 29 K, which is much higher than the T_{c} values of our films. We find that the superconducting properties, T_{c} and B_{c2}, for our films are similar to those for conventional amorphous alloy films, such as thick (100 nm) a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films.[23, 24] The T_{c} changes systematically and smoothly as a function of x, exhibiting a peak (T_{c} \approx 6.1 K) at x \approx 0.33 (=x_{p}). Seven films studied in this work are classified into two groups. For films with x < x_{p} the slope of the critical field B_{0}(T) where the dc resistivity vanishes is larger than that for films with x \ggx_{p}. The "vortex-liquid phase" is even narrower than that reported for clean MgB_{2} samples but somewhat broader than that for thick a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films.[23, 24] The preliminary results, the preparation method, and characterization of the a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films are presented elsewhere.[25]

The films were prepared by coevaporation of pure Mg (99.9 %) and B (99.9 %) from electron-beam crucibles onto a glass substrate held at room temperature. The vacuum was \sim 10^{-10} Torr before deposition and approximately 10^{-8} Torr during deposition. In order to obtain a series of samples with continuously changing x for fixed thickness, we employed a gradient deposition technique.[22, 26] The edges of the film were trimmed by a sharp stylus to avoid ambiguity in thickness. The shape of the film was not perfectly rectangular and hence, there is some ambiguity in determining \rho_{n}. The size of our film was 2.5 mm in length, 0.5-1 mm in width, and 290 nm in thickness. The gradient of Mg concentration, which was in parallel to the direction of the sample width, was smaller than 0.09%/mm, which corresponds to the T_{c} variation of 0.02 K (films 4-6)-0.13 K (film 1) within each film. We prepared seven films with x ranging from 0.39 (film 1) to 0.29 (film 7). The absolute values of x were not determined directly from the experiments but merely calculated from the deposition rate. The electrical resistivity \rho was measured by the conventional four-terminal ac locking and dc methods. The magnetic field was directed perpendicular to the plane of the film.

We have taken a transmission-electron micrograph (TEM) and an electron-diffraction pattern of the 10-nm-thick Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films with x = 0.4 and 0.3. In either film we do not observe any sign of granular structure down to about 1 nm. Typically shown in Fig. 1 is the TEM image of the 10-nm thick Mg_{x}B_{1-x} film with x\!=\!0.3 deposited on a thin a-C film at room temperature. The very small structure (<1 nm) that is visible in Fig. 1 is most likely attributed to that of a-C. We thus consider that a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films can be fabricated at room temperature by coevaporation of Mg and B at least within the x range studied. [27]

The normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} at 10 K shows a trend to increase as x decreases, \rho_{n}\!\sim\!\!4\times\!10^{2}\mu\Omega cm for film 1 (x = 0.39) and 7.4\times\!10^{2}\mu\Omega cm for film 7 (x\!=\!0.29), as is similar to the case with a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films. [22] We notice, however, that \rho_{n} for films 1-4 stays almost constant within our experimental resolutions. The reason is not clear, but it may be partly attributed to ambiguity in determining \rho_{n} mentioned above. As is shown below, T_{c} , which is not dependent on the sample size, exhibits a systematic change against x, indicating that electronic states for films 1-7 indeed change as a function of x.

Typically shown in Fig. 2 is the temperature dependence of the resistivity \rho(T) for film 3 in different magnetic fields.

Upon cooling from room temperature, \rho(T) in B\!=\!0 stays almost constant or increases very slowly without showing any sign of superconductivity at T\!\sim\!39 K. With further decreasing T, \rho(T) exhibits a sudden decrease at around 5 K and falls to zero at 4.4 K. The superconducting-transition (zero-resistivity) temperature T_{c}\!=\!4.4 K is much lower than T_{c}\!=\!39 K for MgB_{2} crystals. Here, we define the onset temperature T_{on} as a temperature at which \rho decreases to 90% of \rho_{n} (10 K). The width of the transition curve, as defined as \Delta T\!=\!T_{on}\!-\!T_{c} , is 0.34 K. In B\!=\!0.1 T, the transition width \Delta T is larger than that in zero field. With further increasing B\!  x, showing a peak at 1\!-\!x_{p}\!\approx\!0.675\!\pm\!0.005 (x_{p}\!\approx\!0.325\pm\!0.005) for film 5. The maximum value of T_{c}\!=\!6.1 K is close to that (T_{c}\!\sim\!7 K) for thick a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films. It is interesting to note that x_{p} corresponds to 1/3 (i.e., MgB_{2}). We cannot tell definitely, however, whether x_{p} exactly coincides with 1/3, since the absolute value of x cannot be determined precisely from the present experiment.

One may question that the variation in T_{c} observed among films 1-7 may imply the occurrence of superconductivity in different stoichiometric phases of the Mg-B system, such as MgB_{4} (x\!=\!0.20) and MgB_{6} (x\!=\!0.14) or other unknown Mg_{x}B_{1-x} compounds.[15] However, the following facts suggest that such a possibility is weak: (i) The range of x (=0.29-0.39) studied in this work is narrow, (ii) the resistive transition \rho(T) is smooth and relatively sharp except for film 1, and (iii) the variation of T_{c} with x is smooth, which would not be expected if our film was composed of more than two phases with different T_{c} . The shape of the transition curve \rho(T) for film 1 looks broader, though smooth, as compared to \rho(T) for the rest of six films 2-7. We consider that part of the reason is due to T_{c} variation within the sample resulting from a gradient of x, since dT_{c}/dx is largest for film 1 (Fig. 4). The results obtained here are different from what has been reported for polycrystalline Mg_{1-x}B_{2} samples with 0\!\approx\!x\!\approx\!0.15 in which percolative superconductivity is observed.[18]

Let us consider the possible phase diagram in the mixed state. We present the characteristic fields vs T for the selected films 2, 3, and 5 [Fig. 5(a)] and films 6 and 7 [Fig. 5(b)] extracted from the \rho(T) data in various B on the basis of different criteria: onset B_{0.9} (open symbols) and completion B_{0} (full symbols). Here, B_{0.9} and B_{0}, respectively, represent the points where \rho decreases to 90% and 0.01% of \rho_{n} (10 K). In the vortex phase diagram in the B-T plane, B_{0.9} and B_{0} are roughly identified with the upper critical field B_{c2} and the "melting field" (the first-order or second-order transition), respectively. The whole shapes of B_{c2}(T) [or B_{0}(T)] films 1-5 are similar to each other, while the slope of the B_{c2}(T) [or B_{0}(T)] lines for films 6 and 7 is remarkably larger than that for films 1-5. This is clearly seen by comparing, for example, B_{c2}(0)\!=\!2.4 T for film 3 with B_{c2}(0) = 5.4 T for film 7, whose T_{c}\!=\!4.3-4.4 K is nearly identical to each other.

In Fig. 6 we plot B_{0}(0) for films 2-7 against T_{c} , where B_{0}(0) is obtained by extrapolating B_{0}(T) to T\!=\!0. For film 1, B_{c2}(0) is plotted instead of B_{0}(0), since B_{0}(0) is not determined unambiguously within the T range measured. All the films studied in this work are classified into two groups; films 1-5 with x\!\geq\!x_{p} and films 6 and 7 with x\!<\!x_{p} . In either group B_{0}(0) roughly follows the linear relation, B_{0}(0) = aT_{c} , where a\!=\!0.47 and 0.80 T/K for films with x\!\geq\!x_{p} and x\!<\!x_{p} , respectively. More precisely, film 5 may be located in the intermediate regime between two groups. The results presented here indicate that there is a difference in the electronic and/or vortex states between the two groups. The superconducting properties for films 6 and 7 with x\!<\!x_{p} are most likely dominated by localization effects caused by reduction of carrier concentration x.[22, 26, 28] Although the physical mechanism responsible for superconductivity in a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films is still unknown, we hope the present results will provide some useful information in preparing high-quality MgB_{2} films and in understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in amorphous alloy films.

As pointed out earlier, there is big difference between the values of T_{c} (\!\approx\!6.1 K) obtained in the present work for

Figure 5: Characteristic fields vs T for (a) films 2, 3, and 5 and (b) films 6 and 7: onset B_{0.9} (open symbols) and vanishing resistivity B_{0} (full symbols). Here B_{0.9} and B_{0}, respectively, represent the points where \rho decreases to 90% and 0.01% of \rho_{n} (10 K). The dashed and full lines are guides to the eye.

  a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films and the value of T_{c}\approx 29 K reported in Ref. [16] for a-MgB_{2} films. The higher T_{c} reported in a-MgB_{2} films, together with the fact that the bulk of the a-MgB_{2} films exhibits a fully stoichiometric composition of Mg and B, may be due to postannealing at temperatures higher than 600 ^{\circ}C. [16] We assume that the annealing process may lead to formation of crystallinelike grains with higher T_{c} (\gg 6 K), which may not be detected experimentally. Actually, it has been reported by Kus and co-workers that the superconducting properties depend strongly on the conditions of annealing and that the granular nature has been suggested by the critical current density. [16]

Finally, we comment on the "vortex-liquid phase." We have commonly observed that the B_{c2}(T) line in the B-T phase diagram runs nearly parallel to the B_{0}(T) line except near T_{c} down to the lowest T measured. The similar feature is observed for thick a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films with various x. [23, 24, 28] The behavior observed for a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} and a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films is markedly different from what has been reported for MgB_{2} single crystals and dense polycrystalline wires, where the width of the vortex-liquid phase \Delta B(T), as defined as \Delta B(T) = B_{c2}(T) = B_{c2}(T) - B_{0}(T), grows remarkably upon cooling.

To summarize, we report the observation of superconductivity in a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films with x = 0.29- 0.39. We find that T_{c} changes smoothly as a function of x, exhibiting a peak (T_{c}\approx 6.1 K) at x_{p}\approx0.33. Seven films studied in this work are classified into two groups. For films with x<x_{p} the slope of the B_{0}(T) line is larger than that for films with x\ggx_{p}, indicating that there is a difference in the electronic and/or vortex states between the two groups. The preliminary measurements of the ac complex resistivity [23, 29] for the present a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films suggest the existence of the vortex-glass transition [30] at around B_{0}.

Since the discovery of superconductivity in MgB_{2} at about 39 K,[1] much effort has been devoted to fabricating high-quality crystals. To date, films with a highly c-axis-oriented crystal structure,[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] as well as bulk single crystals,[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have been fabricated. These samples are considered to be sufficiently clean, having the low resistivity in the normal state at 40 K (\rho_{n}\sim 0.1-10 \mu\Omega cm). However, the superconducting properties, as well as the values of \rho_{n}, are dependent on preparation methods. The superconducting-transition temperature T_{c} for the crystal samples stays close to 39 K, while somewhat lower values of T_{c} (\sim 22-39 K) have been reported for the film samples.[15, 16] The upper critical field B_{c2}(0) in the limit of zero temperature (T\rightarrow0) ranges from \sim 4 T for single crystals, where the field is applied perpendicular to the Mg and B planes, to 15 T for wires and polycrystallines. On the basis of data of dc resistivity and magnetic measurements, the possible vortex phase diagram in the field-temperature (B-T) plane has been actively discussed. One of the most striking features is the extremely broad "vortex-liquid phase" which grows progressively with decreasing temperature.

Compared with clean samples, very little has been studied about the dirty samples.[16, 17, 18] It is interesting to study amorphous (a-)Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films where disorder is microscopic and extremely strong. Of course it is not evident whether we can fabricate a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films, and even if we can fabricate them, it is not clear whether they exhibit superconductivity. To date, several amorphous alloy films are known to exhibit superconductivity.[19, 20, 21, 22] For instance, in molybdenum-base a-Mo_{x}Ge_{1-x} (Ref. [20]) and a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films, T_{c} is varied as a function of x. Mo is itself a superconductor with a bulk T_{c} of 0.9 K, while T_{c}'s of these amorphous alloy films are much higher than 1 K for moderate Mo concentration x: e.g., T_{c} of the 100-nm-thick a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films reaches 7 K for x = 0.7.[19]

In this paper we report the observation of superconductivity in thick a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films with varying x. The a-MgB_{2} films which exhibit superconductivity have been already reported by Kus _et al.[16]_ However, the preparation method and superconducting properties are very different from those in the present study, suggesting that the microscopic or mesoscopic structure of the films is also different. The films reported on in Ref. [16] were deposited on flexible plastic substrates and subsequently heated to approximately 600 ^{\circ}C. The onset temperature of the superconducting transition was about 29 K, which is much higher than the T_{c} values of our films. We find that the superconducting properties, T_{c} and B_{c2}, for our films are similar to those for conventional amorphous alloy films, such as thick (100 nm) a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films.[23, 24] The T_{c} changes systematically and smoothly as a function of x, exhibiting a peak (T_{c} \approx 6.1 K) at x \approx 0.33 (=x_{p}). Seven films studied in this work are classified into two groups. For films with x < x_{p} the slope of the critical field B_{0}(T) where the dc resistivity vanishes is larger than that for films with x \ggx_{p}. The "vortex-liquid phase" is even narrower than that reported for clean MgB_{2} samples but somewhat broader than that for thick a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films.[23, 24] The preliminary results, the preparation method, and characterization of the a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films are presented elsewhere.[25]

The films were prepared by coevaporation of pure Mg (99.9 %) and B (99.9 %) from electron-beam crucibles onto a glass substrate held at room temperature. The vacuum was \sim 10^{-10} Torr before deposition and approximately 10^{-8} Torr during deposition. In order to obtain a series of samples with continuously changing x for fixed thickness, we employed a gradient deposition technique.[22, 26] The edges of the film were trimmed by a sharp stylus to avoid ambiguity in thickness. The shape of the film was not perfectly rectangular and hence, there is some ambiguity in determining \rho_{n}. The size of our film was 2.5 mm in length, 0.5-1 mm in width, and 290 nm in thickness. The gradient of Mg concentration, which was in parallel to the direction of the sample width, was smaller than 0.09%/mm, which corresponds to the T_{c} variation of 0.02 K (films 4-6)-0.13 K (film 1) within each film. We prepared seven films with x ranging from 0.39 (film 1) to 0.29 (film 7). The absolute values of x were not determined directly from the experiments but merely calculated from the deposition rate. The electrical resistivity \rho was measured by the conventional four-terminal ac locking and dc methods. The magnetic field was directed perpendicular to the plane of the film.

We have taken a transmission-electron micrograph (TEM) and an electron-diffraction pattern of the 10-nm-thick Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films with x = 0.4 and 0.3. In either film we do not observe any sign of granular structure down to about 1 nm. Typically shown in Fig. 1 is the TEM image of the 10-nm thick Mg_{x}B_{1-x} film with x\!=\!0.3 deposited on a thin a-C film at room temperature. The very small structure (<1 nm) that is visible in Fig. 1 is most likely attributed to that of a-C. We thus consider that a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films can be fabricated at room temperature by coevaporation of Mg and B at least within the x range studied. [27]

The normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} at 10 K shows a trend to increase as x decreases, \rho_{n}\!\sim\!\!4\times\!10^{2}\mu\Omega cm for film 1 (x = 0.39) and 7.4\times\!10^{2}\mu\Omega cm for film 7 (x\!=\!0.29), as is similar to the case with a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films. [22] We notice, however, that \rho_{n} for films 1-4 stays almost constant within our experimental resolutions. The reason is not clear, but it may be partly attributed to ambiguity in determining \rho_{n} mentioned above. As is shown below, T_{c} , which is not dependent on the sample size, exhibits a systematic change against x, indicating that electronic states for films 1-7 indeed change as a function of x.

Typically shown in Fig. 2 is the temperature dependence of the resistivity \rho(T) for film 3 in different magnetic fields.

Upon cooling from room temperature, \rho(T) in B\!=\!0 stays almost constant or increases very slowly without showing any sign of superconductivity at T\!\sim\!39 K. With further decreasing T, \rho(T) exhibits a sudden decrease at around 5 K and falls to zero at 4.4 K. The superconducting-transition (zero-resistivity) temperature T_{c}\!=\!4.4 K is much lower than T_{c}\!=\!39 K for MgB_{2} crystals. Here, we define the onset temperature T_{on} as a temperature at which \rho decreases to 90% of \rho_{n} (10 K). The width of the transition curve, as defined as \Delta T\!=\!T_{on}\!-\!T_{c} , is 0.34 K. In B\!=\!0.1 T, the transition width \Delta T is larger than that in zero field. With further increasing B\!  x, showing a peak at 1\!-\!x_{p}\!\approx\!0.675\!\pm\!0.005 (x_{p}\!\approx\!0.325\pm\!0.005) for film 5. The maximum value of T_{c}\!=\!6.1 K is close to that (T_{c}\!\sim\!7 K) for thick a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films. It is interesting to note that x_{p} corresponds to 1/3 (i.e., MgB_{2}). We cannot tell definitely, however, whether x_{p} exactly coincides with 1/3, since the absolute value of x cannot be determined precisely from the present experiment.

One may question that the variation in T_{c} observed among films 1-7 may imply the occurrence of superconductivity in different stoichiometric phases of the Mg-B system, such as MgB_{4} (x\!=\!0.20) and MgB_{6} (x\!=\!0.14) or other unknown Mg_{x}B_{1-x} compounds.[15] However, the following facts suggest that such a possibility is weak: (i) The range of x (=0.29-0.39) studied in this work is narrow, (ii) the resistive transition \rho(T) is smooth and relatively sharp except for film 1, and (iii) the variation of T_{c} with x is smooth, which would not be expected if our film was composed of more than two phases with different T_{c} . The shape of the transition curve \rho(T) for film 1 looks broader, though smooth, as compared to \rho(T) for the rest of six films 2-7. We consider that part of the reason is due to T_{c} variation within the sample resulting from a gradient of x, since dT_{c}/dx is largest for film 1 (Fig. 4). The results obtained here are different from what has been reported for polycrystalline Mg_{1-x}B_{2} samples with 0\!\approx\!x\!\approx\!0.15 in which percolative superconductivity is observed.[18]

Let us consider the possible phase diagram in the mixed state. We present the characteristic fields vs T for the selected films 2, 3, and 5 [Fig. 5(a)] and films 6 and 7 [Fig. 5(b)] extracted from the \rho(T) data in various B on the basis of different criteria: onset B_{0.9} (open symbols) and completion B_{0} (full symbols). Here, B_{0.9} and B_{0}, respectively, represent the points where \rho decreases to 90% and 0.01% of \rho_{n} (10 K). In the vortex phase diagram in the B-T plane, B_{0.9} and B_{0} are roughly identified with the upper critical field B_{c2} and the "melting field" (the first-order or second-order transition), respectively. The whole shapes of B_{c2}(T) [or B_{0}(T)] films 1-5 are similar to each other, while the slope of the B_{c2}(T) [or B_{0}(T)] lines for films 6 and 7 is remarkably larger than that for films 1-5. This is clearly seen by comparing, for example, B_{c2}(0)\!=\!2.4 T for film 3 with B_{c2}(0) = 5.4 T for film 7, whose T_{c}\!=\!4.3-4.4 K is nearly identical to each other.

In Fig. 6 we plot B_{0}(0) for films 2-7 against T_{c} , where B_{0}(0) is obtained by extrapolating B_{0}(T) to T\!=\!0. For film 1, B_{c2}(0) is plotted instead of B_{0}(0), since B_{0}(0) is not determined unambiguously within the T range measured. All the films studied in this work are classified into two groups; films 1-5 with x\!\geq\!x_{p} and films 6 and 7 with x\!<\!x_{p} . In either group B_{0}(0) roughly follows the linear relation, B_{0}(0) = aT_{c} , where a\!=\!0.47 and 0.80 T/K for films with x\!\geq\!x_{p} and x\!<\!x_{p} , respectively. More precisely, film 5 may be located in the intermediate regime between two groups. The results presented here indicate that there is a difference in the electronic and/or vortex states between the two groups. The superconducting properties for films 6 and 7 with x\!<\!x_{p} are most likely dominated by localization effects caused by reduction of carrier concentration x.[22, 26, 28] Although the physical mechanism responsible for superconductivity in a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films is still unknown, we hope the present results will provide some useful information in preparing high-quality MgB_{2} films and in understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in amorphous alloy films.

As pointed out earlier, there is big difference between the values of T_{c} (\!\approx\!6.1 K) obtained in the present work for

Here B_{0.9} and B_{0}, respectively, represent the points where \rho decreases to 90% and 0.01% of \rho_{n} (10 K). The dashed and full lines are guides to the eye.

  a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films and the value of T_{c}\approx 29 K reported in Ref. [16] for a-MgB_{2} films. The higher T_{c} reported in a-MgB_{2} films, together with the fact that the bulk of the a-MgB_{2} films exhibits a fully stoichiometric composition of Mg and B, may be due to postannealing at temperatures higher than 600 ^{\circ}C. [16] We assume that the annealing process may lead to formation of crystallinelike grains with higher T_{c} (\gg 6 K), which may not be detected experimentally. Actually, it has been reported by Kus and co-workers that the superconducting properties depend strongly on the conditions of annealing and that the granular nature has been suggested by the critical current density. [16]

Finally, we comment on the "vortex-liquid phase." We have commonly observed that the B_{c2}(T) line in the B-T phase diagram runs nearly parallel to the B_{0}(T) line except near T_{c} down to the lowest T measured. The similar feature is observed for thick a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films with various x. [23, 24, 28] The behavior observed for a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} and a-Mo_{x}Si_{1-x} films is markedly different from what has been reported for MgB_{2} single crystals and dense polycrystalline wires, where the width of the vortex-liquid phase \Delta B(T), as defined as \Delta B(T) = B_{c2}(T) = B_{c2}(T) - B_{0}(T), grows remarkably upon cooling.

To summarize, we report the observation of superconductivity in a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films with x = 0.29- 0.39. We find that T_{c} changes smoothly as a function of x, exhibiting a peak (T_{c}\approx 6.1 K) at x_{p}\approx0.33. Seven films studied in this work are classified into two groups. For films with x<x_{p} the slope of the B_{0}(T) line is larger than that for films with x\ggx_{p}, indicating that there is a difference in the electronic and/or vortex states between the two groups. The preliminary measurements of the ac complex resistivity [23, 29] for the present a-Mg_{x}B_{1-x} films suggest the existence of the vortex-glass transition [30] at around B_{0}.
