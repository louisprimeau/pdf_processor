###### Abstract

The far-infrared reflectivity along the c axis in La2CuO4+_d_, La1.89Ca1.11Cu2O6+_d_ (double pyramidal planes), and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x (_T_' phase) single crystals is measured down to 9 cm-1. All the insulating spectra in the normal states change to show a sharp plasma edge in the superconducting state, which confirms our earlier report of sphere resonance of powder samples [Shibata and Yamada, Phys. Rev. B **54**, 7500 (1996)]. The edge of La1.89Ca1.11Cu2O6+_d_ is broader than that of La2CuO4+_d_ and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x_, indicating the existence of a large number of unpaired carriers in the superconducting state. The obtained _c_-axis penetration depth _l_c_ is discussed based on the Josephson-coupled layer model. [S0163-1829(97)51746-2]

It is well known that the electronic structure of high-temperature copper oxide superconductors has a strong anisotropy, which is typically shown as the metallic temperature dependence of r_{b} and the semiconductive temperature dependence of r_{c}. In optical measurement, almost-insulating infrared spectra are observed along the c axis in the normal state, in contrast to the metal-like spectra along the _ab_ plane. In the superconducting state, a sharp reflectivity edge is observed along the c axis in the far-infrared region. The reflectivity edge is regarded as the plasma edge of condensed carriers in the superconducting state, and the frequency of the edge is determined by the zero crossing of r_{c}(_u_). The plasma edge has been observed in La2-_x_Sr_CuO4, YBa2Cu3O6+_d_, YBa2Cu4O8, and Pb2Sr2(Y,Ca)Cu3O8 from the _c_-axis reflectivity measurement of single crystals.1-5 We have previously measured the sphere resonance of various high-_T__c_ powder samples and have shown that the plasma also exists in Bi1.89Pb0.38Sr2Ca2Cu3.1O9 (Bi2223), La1.82Ca1.18Cu2O6+_d_, (Nd0.66Sr0.205Co1.135)2CuO4 (_T_'s phase), (Ba0.56Sr0.42)Cu1.102+_d_(CO3)0.99 (copper-oxycarbonate), Pr1.85Ca0.15CuO4, and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x_, which means that the plasma exists in most high-_T__c_ cuprates.6 However, for a detailed investigation of their properties, measurement using single crystals is necessary.

Although it seems quite difficult to grow single crystals of Bi2223, _T_' phase, and copper-oxycarbonate,7 high-quality single-crystal growth of La1.89Ca1.18Cu2O6+_d_ and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x have been reported.8-10 The present paper first reports the measurements of far-infrared reflectivity along the c axis in La1.89Ca1.11Cu2O6+_d_ and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x single crystals down to 9 cm-1. We also report the measurement of La2CuO4+_d_ single crystal, which did not show a plasma edge down to 30 cm-1.11 All the spectra show insulating behavior in the normal states, and they change to show a sharp plasma edge in the superconducting state. The plasma is identified as the Josephson plasma oscillation in the weakly Josephson-coupled layer superconductors, and the _c_-axis penetration depth _l_c_ is discussed based on this model.

Large single crystals of La2CuO4+_d_ with the dimensions 1x4x4 mm3 were grown by the traveling-solvent-floating-zone (TSFZ) method and oxidized by high oxygen pressure annealing.12 The sample showed a bulk superconductivity with T_{c} = 33 K from the magnetic susceptibility measurement, as shown in Fig. 1. It has been revealed that there are two superconducting phases in La2CuO4+_d_, one having d = 0.11-0.12 with T_{c} = 40-45 K and the other d = 0.06-0.08 with T_{c} = 32-34 K.13 Although we did not determine the oxygen content, T_{c} = 33 K suggests that the excess oxygen content d of the sample is about 0.06. The La1.89Ca1.11Cu2O6+_d_ crystals were grown by the conventional CuO flux method and also oxidized by high oxygen smearing.8 They showed a bulk superconductivity with T_{c} = 47 K as shown in Fig. 1. The typical sample size was 3x3x0.5 mm3. Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x_ crystals with the dimensions 4x4x0.4 mm3 were also grown by the CuO flux method.10 These were deoxidized in Ar atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 1, they showed a bulk superconductivity with T_{c} = 21 K.

The polarized reflectivity measurements for **E**\parallel_c_ were carried out down to 9 cm-1 using a rapid scan interferometer with a Si bolometer operated at 1.5 and 4 K.6 In order to obtain sufficient size for the far-infrared measurement along **E**\parallel_c_, three La1.89Ca1.11Cu2O6+_d_s_ crystals and ten

  Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} crystals were stacked and bonded, and the side of each stack was polished. After the measurement of the spectra, the sample was coated _in situ_ with gold and then the reference spectra were measured.[2] The spectra were calibrated to room-temperature data, which was measured between 250 and 20 000 cm^{-1} using a microscope for unbonded crystals.[14, 15]

Figure 2(a) shows the reflectivity spectra for **E\parallel**_c_ of La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}. The room-temperature spectra agree well with earlier results for undoped La_{2}CuO_{4}. However, as the temperature decreases, a very weak structure not observed in the undoped sample appears just below the phonon peak at 512 cm^{-1}. This structure has been more clearly observed in electrochemically oxidized La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} with T_{c}=40 K and \delta=0.12, and is attributed to the splitting of the apical oxygen vibration mode along the c axis due to the incorporation of additional oxygen.[11] The observed weaker structure can be explained by the smaller oxygen content in the sample. The reflectivity below 50 cm^{-1} slightly decreases as the temperature decreases, which corresponds to the semiconducting temperature dependence of the dc conductivity. The insulating spectra in the normal state change to show a sharp reflectivity edge in the superconducting state, which is identified as the plasma edge of condensed carriers. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the real part of the dielectric function \epsilon_{1}(\omega), which is calculated by the Kramers-Kronig transformation, crosses zero below T_{c} .

Similar spectra for **E\parallel**_c_ are also observed in La_{1.88}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The normal-state reflectivity is dominated by three strong optical phonons at 146, 256, and 512 cm^{-1} and does not show the plasma edge. The reflectivity below 50 cm^{-1} slightly increases as \omega approaches 0 cm^{-1}, suggesting the existence of overdamped Drude conductivity, which is consistent with the weakly metallic temperature dependence of \rho_{c}(d\rho_{c}/dT\!\!>\!0).[9, 16] In the superconducting state, the reflectivity edge due to the plasma of condensed carriers appears, which is confirmed by the zero crossing of \epsilon_{1}(\omega) in Fig. 3(b). The frequency of the edge well corresponds to the previously observed absorption peak for powder samples.[6] The spectra do not change below 10 K, however, the edge at 5 K is not as sharp as that of La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}. It suggests the existence of unpaired carriers, which is discussed later.

Figure 4 shows the far-infrared reflectivity spectra for **E\parallel**_c_ of Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}. As with La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and La_{1.88}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, the insulating spectra in the normal state change to show a reflectivity edge of condensed carriers in the superconducting state. Again, the frequency of the edge well corresponds to the absorption peak of powder samples.[6] The edge is very sharp, suggesting the absence of residual conductivity in this frequency region.

Usually, the c-axis penetration depth \lambda_{c} is directly obtained from the sum rule analysis of \sigma_{1}(\omega) and/or from \epsilon_{1}(\omega), which are determined by the Kramers-Kronig transformation. In this case, we determine \lambda_{c} by fitting the reflectivity to avoid the error of absolute reflectivity and low

  frequency extrapolation in Kramers-Kronig transformation. We assume the low-frequency dielectric function of superconductors at 5 K can be written by the two-fluid model such that

\[\epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon_{\infty} - \frac{\omega_{pr}^{2}}{\omega^{2}} - \frac{\omega_{pn}^{2}}{\omega(\omega + i\gamma)},\]

where \epsilon_{\infty}, \omega_{ps}, \omega_{pn}, and \gamma are the high-frequency dielectric constant, plasma frequency of condensed carrier, plasma frequency, and scattering rate of normal component. In this equation, the Drude formula temporarily expresses the residual conductivity within the superconducting gap region. Assuming the dielectric function of Eq. (1), the reflectivity R(\omega) below 50 cm^{- 1} at 5 K in Fig. 2(a) is fitted by the relation

\[R(\omega) = \left| \frac{1 - \sqrt{\epsilon(\omega)}}{1 + \sqrt{\epsilon(\omega)}} \right|^{2}.\]

The fit gives \epsilon_{\infty} = 26.1 and \omega_{ps} = 75.6 cm^{- 1}, which gives the c-axis penetration depth \lambda_{c} = 21\mum although \omega_{pn} and \gamma cannot be simultaneously determined. The details of the above fitting procedure for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} have been discussed by Kim _et al._[17] The same fitting in Fig. 3(a) gives \epsilon_{\infty} = 27 and \omega_{ps} = 160 cm^{- 1}, which gives \lambda_{c} = 13\mum for La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, and the fitting in Fig. 4 gives \epsilon_{\infty} = 20 and \omega_{ps} = 50 cm^{- 1}, which gives \lambda_{c} = 32\mum for Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}.

These large c-axis penetration depths can be explained by the Josephson-coupled layer model along the c axis. In the model, \lambda_{c} is equal to the Josephson penetration depth \lambda_{J}, which is expressed as

\[\lambda_{J} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^{2}\rho_{c}}{4\pi^{2}\Delta}},\]

where \Delta is the superconducting gap value. [1, 4, 6] Assuming that \rho_{c} = 3\Omega cm and 2\Delta = 180 cm^{- 1} for La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and 4\Omega cm and 105 cm^{- 1} for Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}, [18, 19]\lambda_{c} = 21\mum for La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and \lambda_{c} = 32\mum for Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} are deduced from Eq. (3). It has been shown that the model also explains the value of \lambda_{c} in other cuprates such as La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta}, [1, 3, 4, 6] and it confirms that the observed plasma edge is Josephson plasma oscillation in Josephson-coupled layer superconductors. For the definitive study of the Josephson plasma oscillation, optical measurement under magnetic field is necessary, as has been done for Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} in the microwave region. [20]

Although the Josephson-coupled layer model well describes the \lambda_{c} of many high-T_{c} cuprates, a significant deviation from the model is observed in the case of La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}. The observed value of \lambda_{c} = 13\mum is much longer than the value of \lambda_{c} = 2.6\mum expected from the model assuming 2\Delta = 200 cm^{- 1} and \rho_{c} = 0.1\Omega cm, which was obtained from the transport measurement. [9, 16] The discrepancy arises because the model does not take into account the existence of large numbers of unpaired carriers in the superconducting state. Due to these unpaired carriers as shown in Fig. 3(a), the superfluid density in La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} becomes smaller, and \lambda_{c} increases. Numerous unpaired carriers are also observed in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta} in the overdoped region, and their existence has been claimed to be an inherent property of high-T_{c} cuprates in the overdoped region. [1, 3] However, it seems hopeless to explain these unpaired carriers as an inherent property in the overdoped region or to attribute them to thermal excitation of quasiparticles, since La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} is in the light-doped region and the reflectivity spectra do not change below 10 K. [14, 16] In this case, the existence of the large number of unpaired carriers may come from a strong disorder effect in the gap with nodes, since there are La and Ca disorder and oxygen vacancies between two CuO_{2} planes in La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}.

The value of \lambda_{c} is much longer than the in-plane penetration depth \lambda_{ab} of 0.42 \mum for La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and \lambda_{ab} of 0.13 \mum for Nd_{1.85}C_{0.15}CuO_{4}, which were estimated from \muSR and microwave absorption measurements. [21, 22] The anisotropy \lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab} for La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} is 50, which is almost equal to the value for La_{1.92}Sr_{0.00}CuO_{4}. [1] Since the hole doping level of La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} with T_{c} = 33 K is almost equal to the level of La_{1.92}Sr_{0.08}CuO_{4}, [13] the present result indicates that the (La,Sr)_{2}O_{2} layer and La_{2}O_{2+\delta} layer have the same insulating nature of a buffer layer between CuO_{2} planes. On the other hand, the anisotropy \lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab} for Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} is 250, which means that the insulating nature of the Nd_{2}O_{2-x}F_{x} layer is stronger than that of the La_{2}O_{2+\delta} layer.

In conclusion, we have measured the far-infrared reflectivity for \mathbf{E}\|c in La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}, La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, and Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} single crystals down to 9 cm^{- 1}. All the insulating spectra in the normal states change to show a sharp plasma edge in the superconducting state, which is identified as Josephson plasma oscillation in the Josephson-coupled layer superconductors. In La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, there are a large number of unpaired carriers in the superconducting state. The c-axis penetration depth \lambda_{c} has been discussed based on the model.

We would like to thank Dr. A. Matsuda for valuable discussions.

###### Abstract

The far-infrared reflectivity along the c axis in La2CuO4+_d_, La1.89Ca1.11Cu2O6+_d_ (double pyramidal planes), and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x (_T_' phase) single crystals is measured down to 9 cm-1. All the insulating spectra in the normal states change to show a sharp plasma edge in the superconducting state, which confirms our earlier report of sphere resonance of powder samples [Shibata and Yamada, Phys.

The edge of La1.89Ca1.11Cu2O6+_d_ is broader than that of La2CuO4+_d_ and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x_, indicating the existence of a large number of unpaired carriers in the superconducting state. The obtained _c_-axis penetration depth _l_c_ is discussed based on the Josephson-coupled layer model. [S0163-1829(97)51746-2]

It is well known that the electronic structure of high-temperature copper oxide superconductors has a strong anisotropy, which is typically shown as the metallic temperature dependence of r_{b} and the semiconductive temperature dependence of r_{c}. In optical measurement, almost-insulating infrared spectra are observed along the c axis in the normal state, in contrast to the metal-like spectra along the _ab_ plane. In the superconducting state, a sharp reflectivity edge is observed along the c axis in the far-infrared region. The reflectivity edge is regarded as the plasma edge of condensed carriers in the superconducting state, and the frequency of the edge is determined by the zero crossing of r_{c}(_u_). The plasma edge has been observed in La2-_x_Sr_CuO4, YBa2Cu3O6+_d_, YBa2Cu4O8, and Pb2Sr2(Y,Ca)Cu3O8 from the _c_-axis reflectivity measurement of single crystals.1-5 We have previously measured the sphere resonance of various high-_T__c_ powder samples and have shown that the plasma also exists in Bi1.89Pb0.38Sr2Ca2Cu3.1O9 (Bi2223), La1.82Ca1.18Cu2O6+_d_, (Nd0.66Sr0.205Co1.135)2CuO4 (_T_'s phase), (Ba0.56Sr0.42)Cu1.102+_d_(CO3)0.99 (copper-oxycarbonate), Pr1.85Ca0.15CuO4, and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x_, which means that the plasma exists in most high-_T__c_ cuprates.6 However, for a detailed investigation of their properties, measurement using single crystals is necessary.

Although it seems quite difficult to grow single crystals of Bi2223, _T_' phase, and copper-oxycarbonate,7 high-quality single-crystal growth of La1.89Ca1.18Cu2O6+_d_ and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x have been reported.8-10 The present paper first reports the measurements of far-infrared reflectivity along the c axis in La1.89Ca1.11Cu2O6+_d_ and Nd2CuO4-_x_F_x single crystals down to 9 cm-1. We also report the measurement of La2CuO4+_d_ single crystal, which did not show a plasma edge down to 30 cm-1.11 All the spectra show insulating behavior in the normal states, and they change to show a sharp plasma edge in the superconducting state. The plasma is identified as the Josephson plasma oscillation in the weakly Josephson-coupled layer superconductors, and the _c_-axis penetration depth _l_c_ is discussed based on this model.

Figure 2(a) shows the reflectivity spectra for **E\parallel**_c_ of La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}. The room-temperature spectra agree well with earlier results for undoped La_{2}CuO_{4}. However, as the temperature decreases, a very weak structure not observed in the undoped sample appears just below the phonon peak at 512 cm^{-1}. This structure has been more clearly observed in electrochemically oxidized La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} with T_{c}=40 K and \delta=0.12, and is attributed to the splitting of the apical oxygen vibration mode along the c axis due to the incorporation of additional oxygen.[11] The observed weaker structure can be explained by the smaller oxygen content in the sample. The reflectivity below 50 cm^{-1} slightly decreases as the temperature decreases, which corresponds to the semiconducting temperature dependence of the dc conductivity. The insulating spectra in the normal state change to show a sharp reflectivity edge in the superconducting state, which is identified as the plasma edge of condensed carriers. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the real part of the dielectric function \epsilon_{1}(\omega), which is calculated by the Kramers-Kronig transformation, crosses zero below T_{c} .

Similar spectra for **E\parallel**_c_ are also observed in La_{1.88}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The normal-state reflectivity is dominated by three strong optical phonons at 146, 256, and 512 cm^{-1} and does not show the plasma edge. The reflectivity below 50 cm^{-1} slightly increases as \omega approaches 0 cm^{-1}, suggesting the existence of overdamped Drude conductivity, which is consistent with the weakly metallic temperature dependence of \rho_{c}(d\rho_{c}/dT\!\!>\!0).[9, 16] In the superconducting state, the reflectivity edge due to the plasma of condensed carriers appears, which is confirmed by the zero crossing of \epsilon_{1}(\omega) in Fig. 3(b). The frequency of the edge well corresponds to the previously observed absorption peak for powder samples.[6] The spectra do not change below 10 K, however, the edge at 5 K is not as sharp as that of La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}. It suggests the existence of unpaired carriers, which is discussed later.

Figure 4 shows the far-infrared reflectivity spectra for **E\parallel**_c_ of Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}. As with La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and La_{1.88}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, the insulating spectra in the normal state change to show a reflectivity edge of condensed carriers in the superconducting state. Again, the frequency of the edge well corresponds to the absorption peak of powder samples.[6] The edge is very sharp, suggesting the absence of residual conductivity in this frequency region.

  frequency extrapolation in Kramers-Kronig transformation. We assume the low-frequency dielectric function of superconductors at 5 K can be written by the two-fluid model such that

\[\epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon_{\infty} - \frac{\omega_{pr}^{2}}{\omega^{2}} - \frac{\omega_{pn}^{2}}{\omega(\omega + i\gamma)},\]

where \epsilon_{\infty}, \omega_{ps}, \omega_{pn}, and \gamma are the high-frequency dielectric constant, plasma frequency of condensed carrier, plasma frequency, and scattering rate of normal component. In this equation, the Drude formula temporarily expresses the residual conductivity within the superconducting gap region. Assuming the dielectric function of Eq. (1), the reflectivity R(\omega) below 50 cm^{- 1} at 5 K in Fig. 2(a) is fitted by the relation

\[R(\omega) = \left| \frac{1 - \sqrt{\epsilon(\omega)}}{1 + \sqrt{\epsilon(\omega)}} \right|^{2}.\]

The fit gives \epsilon_{\infty} = 26.1 and \omega_{ps} = 75.6 cm^{- 1}, which gives the c-axis penetration depth \lambda_{c} = 21\mum although \omega_{pn} and \gamma cannot be simultaneously determined. The details of the above fitting procedure for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} have been discussed by Kim _et al._[17] The same fitting in Fig. 3(a) gives \epsilon_{\infty} = 27 and \omega_{ps} = 160 cm^{- 1}, which gives \lambda_{c} = 13\mum for La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, and the fitting in Fig. 4 gives \epsilon_{\infty} = 20 and \omega_{ps} = 50 cm^{- 1}, which gives \lambda_{c} = 32\mum for Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}.

These large c-axis penetration depths can be explained by the Josephson-coupled layer model along the c axis. In the model, \lambda_{c} is equal to the Josephson penetration depth \lambda_{J}, which is expressed as

\[\lambda_{J} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^{2}\rho_{c}}{4\pi^{2}\Delta}},\]

where \Delta is the superconducting gap value. [1, 4, 6] Assuming that \rho_{c} = 3\Omega cm and 2\Delta = 180 cm^{- 1} for La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and 4\Omega cm and 105 cm^{- 1} for Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}, [18, 19]\lambda_{c} = 21\mum for La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and \lambda_{c} = 32\mum for Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} are deduced from Eq. (3). It has been shown that the model also explains the value of \lambda_{c} in other cuprates such as La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta}, [1, 3, 4, 6] and it confirms that the observed plasma edge is Josephson plasma oscillation in Josephson-coupled layer superconductors. For the definitive study of the Josephson plasma oscillation, optical measurement under magnetic field is necessary, as has been done for Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} in the microwave region. [20]

Although the Josephson-coupled layer model well describes the \lambda_{c} of many high-T_{c} cuprates, a significant deviation from the model is observed in the case of La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}. The observed value of \lambda_{c} = 13\mum is much longer than the value of \lambda_{c} = 2.6\mum expected from the model assuming 2\Delta = 200 cm^{- 1} and \rho_{c} = 0.1\Omega cm, which was obtained from the transport measurement. [9, 16] The discrepancy arises because the model does not take into account the existence of large numbers of unpaired carriers in the superconducting state. Due to these unpaired carriers as shown in Fig. 3(a), the superfluid density in La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} becomes smaller, and \lambda_{c} increases. Numerous unpaired carriers are also observed in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta} in the overdoped region, and their existence has been claimed to be an inherent property of high-T_{c} cuprates in the overdoped region. [1, 3] However, it seems hopeless to explain these unpaired carriers as an inherent property in the overdoped region or to attribute them to thermal excitation of quasiparticles, since La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} is in the light-doped region and the reflectivity spectra do not change below 10 K. [14, 16] In this case, the existence of the large number of unpaired carriers may come from a strong disorder effect in the gap with nodes, since there are La and Ca disorder and oxygen vacancies between two CuO_{2} planes in La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}.

The value of \lambda_{c} is much longer than the in-plane penetration depth \lambda_{ab} of 0.42 \mum for La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} and \lambda_{ab} of 0.13 \mum for Nd_{1.85}C_{0.15}CuO_{4}, which were estimated from \muSR and microwave absorption measurements. [21, 22] The anisotropy \lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab} for La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} is 50, which is almost equal to the value for La_{1.92}Sr_{0.00}CuO_{4}. [1] Since the hole doping level of La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} with T_{c} = 33 K is almost equal to the level of La_{1.92}Sr_{0.08}CuO_{4}, [13] the present result indicates that the (La,Sr)_{2}O_{2} layer and La_{2}O_{2+\delta} layer have the same insulating nature of a buffer layer between CuO_{2} planes. On the other hand, the anisotropy \lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab} for Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} is 250, which means that the insulating nature of the Nd_{2}O_{2-x}F_{x} layer is stronger than that of the La_{2}O_{2+\delta} layer.

In conclusion, we have measured the far-infrared reflectivity for \mathbf{E}\|c in La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta}, La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, and Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} single crystals down to 9 cm^{- 1}. All the insulating spectra in the normal states change to show a sharp plasma edge in the superconducting state, which is identified as Josephson plasma oscillation in the Josephson-coupled layer superconductors. In La_{1.89}Ca_{1.11}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, there are a large number of unpaired carriers in the superconducting state. The c-axis penetration depth \lambda_{c} has been discussed based on the model.

We would like to thank Dr. A. Matsuda for valuable discussions.
