###### Abstract

In this paper, a study of the effect of Al substitution on the upper critical field, _Bc2_, in Al_{x}Mg_{1-x}B_{2} samples is presented. We find a straightforward correlation between _Bc2_ and the \sigma-band gap, D_s_{\sigma}_ evaluated by point-contact measurements. Up to x = 0.2, _Bc2_ can be well described within a clean limit model and its decrease with x is directly related to the suppression of D_s_{\sigma}_.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity at 40 K in magnesium diboride has been extensively studied since its discovery.[1] The presence of two bands crossing the Fermi level and having strongly different character [2, 3] is well established: two \pi bands are formed by _pz_ orbitals of boron and are three-dimensional, electron-type, and weakly coupled with phonons; two \sigma bands are formed by _sp_2-hybrid orbitals stretched along the B-B bonds and are two-dimensional, hole-type, and strongly coupled with the optical _Ez_{2g}_ phonon mode. This peculiar band structure, joined to the fact that interband scattering by impurities is inhibited by the different parity of \pi and \sigma orbitals,[4] is at the ground of the two-gap superconductivity. The lack of interband scattering yields important consequences in the transport behavior because it prevents the mixing of the \sigma and \pi carriers, which maintain their own characteristics. This gives a unique chance to selectively disorder each channel independently and offers many opportunities to tune superconducting and normal properties.

Many attempts of selective doping have been carried out. For example, substitution of C in the B site significantly increases the upper critical fields, as reported by several groups, [5, 6, 7] suggesting that, in this case, the dirty regime is well stabilized. On the other hand, Al substitution of Mg does not give unequivocal results. In Al-doped single crystals, the critical field perpendicular to the _ab_ planes, _Bc2.iab_, increases with increasing Al concentration, while the one parallel to the _ab_ planes, _Bc2ab_, decreases, as observed also in polycrystalline samples.[8] The behavior of _Bc2.iab_ has been explained within a dirty limit model, but this interpretation clashes with the decreasing of _Bc2ab_. Actually, there are several effects caused by the Al substitution of Mg: the rising of the Fermi level.[9, 10] the stiffening of the _Ez_{2g}_ mode,[11] and the increasing of the interband scattering.[12] The importance of the last effect on the superconducting properties of Al-doped samples has not been clarified yet. Its main signature should be the decrease of the \sigma-band gap, D_s_{\sigma}_, together with the increase of the \pi-band gap, D_s_{\pi}_; for large interband scattering the gaps should merge to the BCS value.[13] The only available data of gaps as a function of Al (Ref. [14]), show a strong decrease of D_s_{\sigma}_, which could be related to the increased interband scattering, while D_s_{\pi}_ remains rather constant in contrast with expectations.[13]

Both the energy gaps and the scattering rates vary with the doping determining the regime of conduction (clean or dirty) of each band. Thus _Bc2_ must depend on Al doping in a nontrivial way and the study of its behavior gives a unique opportunity to investigate the peculiar role of disorder in a two-gap superconductor.

This paper tackles the multifaceted subject of transport regimes in Al-doped samples. We correlated the upper critical fields, the energy gaps, and the scattering rates in a set of polycrystalline Al_{x}Mg_{1-x}B_{2} samples to investigate the effect of Al substitution on the conduction regimes of \sigma and \pi bands.

## II Experiment

Dense, clean, and hard cylinder-shaped samples were obtained by direct synthesis of pure elements.[13] In order to improve the homogeneity of doping, Mg-Al alloys were prepared in a first step with Al concentration ranging from 0 to 0.2. In the second step, a cylindrical piece of Mg-Al alloy was put, on crystalline B powders, in Ta crucibles welded in argon and closed in quartz tubes. The quartz tube is then placed in a vertical furnace which is at 850-900 degC. The Mg-Al alloy melts and reacts in the liquid state with the B powders; after 1 h the temperature is raised and maintained at 1000 degC for 100 h. This procedure gives hard cylindrical-shaped bulk samples (12 mm diameter and 10 mm height). XRD analyses made on the top and on the bottom of the cylinder have emphasized that the doped samples present a gradient of Al concentration along the height, being that the top of the sample is less Al doped than the bottom. In the most alloyed samples, the Al concentration was found to vary by about D_x_ = 0.05 along the height of the sample. Thus each piece of sample, cut at different height, could present a concentration slightly different from the nominal one: for a careful determination of the actual concentration, XRD, as well as critical temperature evaluation, are required. Seven Al_{x}Mg_{1-x}B_{2} samples were prepared: the samples with x = 0, 0.10, and 0.15 are prepared with natural B, while the samples with x = 0,05, 0.07, and 0.20 are prepared with isotopically enriched ^{11}B. Undoped samples made with ^{11}B instead of natural B present lower resistivity, probably due to the higher  purity of such a boron, but exactly the same upper critical field.[8] Microstructure and chemical composition have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and preliminary transmission electron microscopy.[16] No significant phase separations were detected up to the highest Al concentration: the detected B-rich minority phases were less than 3% in volume in the worst case. Al is incorporated into MgB2 grains of size ~1 _m_m by substitution of a Mg lattice and becomes rather inhomogeneously distributed with increasing Al concentration. X-ray powder patterns were obtained by a Guinier-Stoe camera. No extra peaks due to the presence of free Mg or spurious phases were detected. Peaks of the doped compounds are shifted in comparison with pure MgB2 peaks and they broaden on increasing the Al content; the lattice parameters, reported in Table 1, are in good agreement with other reports.[14, 17]

All the samples were cut in the shape of a parallelepiped bar (~1 x 2 x 12 mm3). Magnetoresistivity measurements were performed from 0 to 9 T in a PPMS Quantum Design system and the undoped sample was measured up to 20.3 T at the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory, France.

Point-contact measurements (PCM) were carried out by using the "soft" technique described elsewhere,[18] which consists of creating a small (nearly 50 _m_m diameter) metallic contact on the sample surface by using a drop of Ag paint. With respect to the more usual point-contact technique, which involves a metallic tip pressed against the sample surface, this ensures much greater stability of the contacts on thermal cycling and reproducibility of the results. Moreover, it is more suited for polycrystalline samples with possible local variations in the chemical composition, since, due to the finite size of the contact, it actually provides an average over a certain region in direct space. The average over a portion of the Fermi surface, instead, is intrinsic to the point-contact technique and arises from the finite aperture of the current injection cone. In the case of polycrystalline Mg1-_x_AlB2 samples, with random grain orientation, this allows observing two-gap structures rather easily--which may be very difficult with strictly directional measurements like STM. The low-temperature conductance curves (d_I_/d_V_ versus V) of the Ag/Mg1-_x_AlB2 point contacts were obtained by numerical differentiation of the measured _I-V_ characteristics, and presented clear structures due to Andreev reflection at the interface, in the form of conductance maxima whose positions give a rough indication of the gap amplitudes.

## Results and discussion

Figure 1 shows the resistivity as a function of temperature of the Mg1-_x_AlB2 samples with x = 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20. The critical temperature T_{c}, the residual resistivity r0, and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) are summarized in Table 1. We assume an error in the evaluation of resistivity of +-10% due to the uncertainty of the geometrical factor. Moreover, in polycrystals it is critically sensitive to sample density and effective percolation path between grains, which causes an overestimation of resistivity. On the other hand, scanning electron microscope images of our samples show a network of well connected grains,[19] so we assume a negligible contribution of grain boundaries.

The transition width gets larger for more heavily doped samples, where inhomogeneities are more likely to occur, but no multiple transitions were observed (see the inset of Fig. 1). The resistivity values are comparable with the ones reported for Al-doped single crystals,[20] indicating the excellent quality of this set of samples. r0 increases monotonically with the doping, ranging from 2.5 _m_O cm to 12 _m_O cm, apart from the x = 0.20 sample, made with 11B, which has a r0 value lower than the x = 0.10 and x = 0.15 samples.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline x ± _Δ_x_ & T_{c} ± _Δ_T__c_/2(K) & _ρ_β_(_μ_Δ_Č  Figure 2 shows, as an example, the magnetoresistivity curves of the x = 0.07 and 0.20 samples measured at a fixed field and varying the temperature. The upper critical field curve B_{c2}(T) was operatively defined as 90% of these curves. Our criterion provides the determination of the uppermost B_{c2}(T) curve, which is B_{c2lab} for the pure polycrystalline samples (Ref. [6] and references therein); in substituted compounds which present some inhomogeneities, our criterion probes the grains with a lower level of doping.

Increasing disorder in single-gap superconductors is usually accompanied by an increase in the upper critical field.[21] In the left panel of Fig. 3, B_{c2} is plotted as a function of temperature for all the samples considered here. As is clearly seen, B_{c2} monotonically decreases with increasing Al concentration; this monotonic trend is maintained even if B_{c2} is plotted as a function of the reduced temperature TT_{c}, as seen in the right panel of Fig. 3. Measurements on Al-doped single crystals show indeed that the critical field decreases with doping when the external field is parallel to the ab planes.[20] In Ref. [8], we showed that at a low level of doping (x < 0.1), this unusual behavior is explained assuming that, in spite of the disorder introduced by Al doping, the B_{c2} can be described within a clean-limit model.

In the clean limit, the critical fields of MgB_{2} at low temperature are determined by the \sigma bands.[22, 23] Thus, far from the transition, the critical fields perpendicular and parallel to the ab planes can be expressed in terms of the coherence lengths of the \sigma carriers in either direction, \xi_{0_{\sigma\,ab}} or \xi_{0_{\sigma\,c}}:

\[B_{c2\perp ab}(T) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{0_{\sigma\,ab}}(T)^{2}},\]

\[B_{c2|ab}(T) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{0_{\sigma\,ab}}(T)\xi_{0_{\sigma\,c}}(T)}.\]

By inserting \  ated by PCM, with the technique described above. Representative low-temperature conductance curves measured in Mg_{1-x}Al_{x}B_{2} samples with x=0, 0.1, and 0.2 are reported in Fig. 5. The fulfillment of the conditions for ballistic conduction across the junction (at least at 4.2 K) is witnessed by the rather flat background and the absence of the typical, strong "dips" that appear in the diffusive regime.[25] Due to the finite size of the Ag-paint spots, the ballistic regime can be accompanied by fairly low normal-state resistance values, because several parallel microjunctions are actually established between the normal metal and the superconductor, in different points of the apparent contact area. The conductance curves clearly show sharp maxima at energies related to the small gap, \Delta_{\sigma}--even though in the x=0.2 case these two peaks are so close that, even at 4.2 K, they cannot be resolved and appear as if they had merged in a single peak at zero bias. Smoother structures related to the large gap, \Delta_{\sigma}, are also present, such as a shoulder in the first two cases (x=0 and x=0.1) and a small peak in the third (x=0.2). The presence of these structures allows a rough evaluation of \Delta_{\sigma}, and ensures a greater reliability of the fitting procedure. In the inset of Fig. 6, for example, we report the experimental curve at x=0.2, after normalization (i.e., division by the normal-state conductance), together with its fit with the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model generalized to the two-band case[18, 26] (solid line), which gives an accurate evaluation of the gap amplitudes. In the main panel of Fig. 6, we plot the so-determined \Delta_{\sigma} and \Delta_{\pi} in a selected set of samples (x=0, 0.1, and 0.2). Because of the dominant contribution of the \pi bands to the conductance across the junction even in polycrystalline samples,[27, 28] the uncertainty on \Delta_{\sigma} is generally larger than that on \Delta_{\pi} as evidenced by the data summarized in Table 2. Note that \Delta_{\sigma} linearly decreases on increasing Al doping from 7.5 meV at x=0 to 3.8 meV at x=0.2, which is consistent with the position of the large-gap structures in the conductance curves of Fig. 5. The small gap \Delta_{\pi} (2.8 meV at x=0) shows a decrease in the whole doping range, becoming as small as 1.7 meV at x=0.2. In the same figure, we also show the results obtained by specific-heat measurements.[14] The overall agreement between the data as a function of doping is impressive considering the differences inherent to the two experimental techniques (heat capacity measures an average gap throughout the sample, while Andreev reflection probes the gap in a local area close to the surface). Thus PCM in Al-doped samples confirm the previous evidence[14] of the strong decrease of \Delta_{\sigma}, not accompanied by the predicted[13] rising of \Delta_{\pi}.

Once the Fermi velocities and the \sigma-band gap have been estimated as functions of Al doping, it should be possible to scale the experimental critical field curves according to Eq. (2b) (as previously remarked, our experimental values of B_{c2} must be compared with B_{c2[ab]}).

In fig. 7, we plot the rescaled critical fields,

\[B_{c2}^{res}(x)=B_{c2}(x)\frac{\Delta_{\sigma}(0)^{2}\,v_{F_{\sigma,ab}}(x)}{ \Delta_{\sigma}(x)^{2}\,v_{F_{\sigma,ab}}(0)}\frac{v_{F_{\sigma,c}}(x)}{v_{F_{\sigma,c}}(0)},\]

where B_{c2}(x) is the experimental critical field for each x value and \Delta_{\sigma}(x) is the linearly interpolated gap. Since B_{c2} is determined by the grains with the lowest doping, \Delta_{\sigma} was estimated, for each concentration, at the minimum doping in the range x\pm\Delta x of Table 1. The values of B_{c2}^{res} have to be compared with the experimental B_{c2}(0) curve (continuous line). The main source of uncertainty on B_{c2}^{res} comes from the

Figure 5: Examples of low-temperature (4.2 K) non-normalized (i.e., as-measured) conductance curves of Ag-spot point contacts on Mg_{1-x}Al_{x}B_{2} samples with (from bottom to top) x=0, x=0.1, and x=0.2. The straight dashed line indicates that the structure related to the large gap \Delta_{\sigma} (a shoulder in the first two cases, and a small peak in the third) moves toward lower energies on increasing the Al content. This is suggestive of the corresponding reduction in the value of the gap amplitude obtained from the fit of the normalized curves.

  ratio between the gaps, which varies by about a factor 2 in the considered range of x. All the curves fall together and overlap with the B_{c2}(0) curve within the experimental uncertainty. Therefore, we can reliably conclude that for x \leq 0.2, a description within a clean limit model works well.

Further support of our analysis comes from the comparison of the \sigma-band scattering rates, \Gamma_{\sigma}, with the energy gaps \Delta_{\sigma}. An estimation of \Gamma_{\sigma} can be made by assuming that the electrical conductivity of Al-doped samples is mainly determined by \sigma-band carriers. In fact, with the \sigma orbitals being localized around the B planes, \Gamma_{\sigma} is only slightly affected by substitution in the Mg planes.[4] This hypothesis, although reasonable, provides lower limits for \Gamma_{\sigma} values; however, even if it is relaxed, our conclusions are substantially unchanged. We assume

\[\rho_{0}_{\sigma}=\Gamma_{\sigma}/(\varepsilon_{0}\omega_{p_{\sigma}}^{2}) =\rho_{0},\] (3)

where \omega_{p_{\sigma}} is the spatially averaged \sigma-band plasma frequency and \varepsilon_{0} is the dielectric constant. The plasma frequencies are given by \omega_{p_{\sigma}}^{2} = 8\pi(\omega_{\sigma}/V_{cell})v_{F_{\sigma}}^{2} and can be calculated by taking into account the dependence on the Al content of the Fermi velocities, of the density of states N_{\sigma}, and of the unit cell volume V_{cell}. The values of \omega_{p_{\sigma}\,ab}, \omega_{p_{\sigma}\,c}, and \omega_{p_{\sigma}} =\left(\frac{2}{3}\omega_{p_{\sigma}\,ab}^{2} +\frac{1}{3}\omega_{p_{\sigma}\,c}^{2}\right)^{1/2} are reported in the lower panel of Fig. 4 as a function of Al doping. As is clearly seen, \omega_{p_{\sigma}} strongly decreases with the doping due to the filling of the \sigma bands. An estimation of \Gamma_{\sigma} for the various samples can be obtained from Eq. (3), using the experimental resistivity values and the calculated plasma frequencies. The results are given in Table I. The \Gamma_{\sigma} values weakly increase with Al concentration ranging from 7 to 13 meV. However, the increase of resistivity is mostly accounted for by the decrease of \omega_{p_{\sigma}}. Finally, in Table I the ratios

\[\frac{\Gamma_{\sigma}}{\pi\Delta_{\sigma}}=\frac{\hbar\,v_{F_{\sigma}}/\pi \Delta_{\sigma}}{\hbar\,v_{F_{\sigma}}/\Gamma_{\sigma}}=\frac{\xi_{0,\sigma}}{ l_{\sigma}}\]

are reported. The ratios \Gamma_{\sigma}/\pi\Delta_{\sigma} turn out to be lower than 1, confirming that the \sigma bands in Al-doped samples are in the clean limit for x \leq 0.2.

In conclusion, in this paper we have discussed the straightforward correlation existing between the critical fields and the \sigma-band gaps in Al-doped samples. Our main experimental evidence is that B_{c2} monotonically decreases with Al doping while the resistivity increases. On the other hand, we estimated a suppression of \Delta_{\sigma} with increasing Al doping. This complex phenomenology can be understood by assuming that Al substitution in the Mg sites suppresses the conduction of \pi bands, but only slightly affects the impurity scattering in \sigma bands. This makes the clean regime of \sigma bands particularly robust; in fact, up to x=0.2 the upper critical field can be well described within a clean-limit model and its decrease is directly related to the suppression of the superconducting \sigma gap.

###### Abstract

In this paper, a study of the effect of Al substitution on the upper critical field, _Bc2_, in Al_{x}Mg_{1-x}B_{2} samples is presented. We find a straightforward correlation between _Bc2_ and the \sigma-band gap, D_s_{\sigma}_ evaluated by point-contact measurements. Up to x = 0.2, _Bc2_ can be well described within a clean limit model and its decrease with x is directly related to the suppression of D_s_{\sigma}_.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity at 40 K in magnesium diboride has been extensively studied since its discovery.[1] The presence of two bands crossing the Fermi level and having strongly different character [2, 3] is well established: two \pi bands are formed by _pz_ orbitals of boron and are three-dimensional, electron-type, and weakly coupled with phonons; two \sigma bands are formed by _sp_2-hybrid orbitals stretched along the B-B bonds and are two-dimensional, hole-type, and strongly coupled with the optical _Ez_{2g}_ phonon mode. This peculiar band structure, joined to the fact that interband scattering by impurities is inhibited by the different parity of \pi and \sigma orbitals,[4] is at the ground of the two-gap superconductivity. The lack of interband scattering yields important consequences in the transport behavior because it prevents the mixing of the \sigma and \pi carriers, which maintain their own characteristics. This gives a unique chance to selectively disorder each channel independently and offers many opportunities to tune superconducting and normal properties.

Many attempts of selective doping have been carried out. For example, substitution of C in the B site significantly increases the upper critical fields, as reported by several groups, [5, 6, 7] suggesting that, in this case, the dirty regime is well stabilized. On the other hand, Al substitution of Mg does not give unequivocal results. In Al-doped single crystals, the critical field perpendicular to the _ab_ planes, _Bc2.iab_, increases with increasing Al concentration, while the one parallel to the _ab_ planes, _Bc2ab_, decreases, as observed also in polycrystalline samples.[8] The behavior of _Bc2.iab_ has been explained within a dirty limit model, but this interpretation clashes with the decreasing of _Bc2ab_. Actually, there are several effects caused by the Al substitution of Mg: the rising of the Fermi level.[9, 10] the stiffening of the _Ez_{2g}_ mode,[11] and the increasing of the interband scattering.[12] The importance of the last effect on the superconducting properties of Al-doped samples has not been clarified yet. Its main signature should be the decrease of the \sigma-band gap, D_s_{\sigma}_, together with the increase of the \pi-band gap, D_s_{\pi}_; for large interband scattering the gaps should merge to the BCS value.[13] The only available data of gaps as a function of Al (Ref. [14]), show a strong decrease of D_s_{\sigma}_, which could be related to the increased interband scattering, while D_s_{\pi}_ remains rather constant in contrast with expectations.[13]

Both the energy gaps and the scattering rates vary with the doping determining the regime of conduction (clean or dirty) of each band. Thus _Bc2_ must depend on Al doping in a nontrivial way and the study of its behavior gives a unique opportunity to investigate the peculiar role of disorder in a two-gap superconductor.

This paper tackles the multifaceted subject of transport regimes in Al-doped samples. We correlated the upper critical fields, the energy gaps, and the scattering rates in a set of polycrystalline Al_{x}Mg_{1-x}B_{2} samples to investigate the effect of Al substitution on the conduction regimes of \sigma and \pi bands.

## II Experiment

Dense, clean, and hard cylinder-shaped samples were obtained by direct synthesis of pure elements.[13] In order to improve the homogeneity of doping, Mg-Al alloys were prepared in a first step with Al concentration ranging from 0 to 0.2. In the second step, a cylindrical piece of Mg-Al alloy was put, on crystalline B powders, in Ta crucibles welded in argon and closed in quartz tubes. The quartz tube is then placed in a vertical furnace which is at 850-900 degC. The Mg-Al alloy melts and reacts in the liquid state with the B powders; after 1 h the temperature is raised and maintained at 1000 degC for 100 h. This procedure gives hard cylindrical-shaped bulk samples (12 mm diameter and 10 mm height). XRD analyses made on the top and on the bottom of the cylinder have emphasized that the doped samples present a gradient of Al concentration along the height, being that the top of the sample is less Al doped than the bottom. In the most alloyed samples, the Al concentration was found to vary by about D_x_ = 0.05 along the height of the sample. Thus each piece of sample, cut at different height, could present a concentration slightly different from the nominal one: for a careful determination of the actual concentration, XRD, as well as critical temperature evaluation, are required. Seven Al_{x}Mg_{1-x}B_{2} samples were prepared: the samples with x = 0, 0.10, and 0.15 are prepared with natural B, while the samples with x = 0,05, 0.07, and 0.20 are prepared with isotopically enriched ^{11}B. Undoped samples made with ^{11}B instead of natural B present lower resistivity, probably due to the higher  purity of such a boron, but exactly the same upper critical field.[8] Microstructure and chemical composition have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and preliminary transmission electron microscopy.[16] No significant phase separations were detected up to the highest Al concentration: the detected B-rich minority phases were less than 3% in volume in the worst case. Al is incorporated into MgB2 grains of size ~1 _m_m by substitution of a Mg lattice and becomes rather inhomogeneously distributed with increasing Al concentration. X-ray powder patterns were obtained by a Guinier-Stoe camera. No extra peaks due to the presence of free Mg or spurious phases were detected. Peaks of the doped compounds are shifted in comparison with pure MgB2 peaks and they broaden on increasing the Al content; the lattice parameters, reported in Table 1, are in good agreement with other reports.[14, 17]

All the samples were cut in the shape of a parallelepiped bar (~1 x 2 x 12 mm3). Magnetoresistivity measurements were performed from 0 to 9 T in a PPMS Quantum Design system and the undoped sample was measured up to 20.3 T at the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory, France.

Point-contact measurements (PCM) were carried out by using the "soft" technique described elsewhere,[18] which consists of creating a small (nearly 50 _m_m diameter) metallic contact on the sample surface by using a drop of Ag paint. With respect to the more usual point-contact technique, which involves a metallic tip pressed against the sample surface, this ensures much greater stability of the contacts on thermal cycling and reproducibility of the results. Moreover, it is more suited for polycrystalline samples with possible local variations in the chemical composition, since, due to the finite size of the contact, it actually provides an average over a certain region in direct space. The average over a portion of the Fermi surface, instead, is intrinsic to the point-contact technique and arises from the finite aperture of the current injection cone. In the case of polycrystalline Mg1-_x_AlB2 samples, with random grain orientation, this allows observing two-gap structures rather easily--which may be very difficult with strictly directional measurements like STM. The low-temperature conductance curves (d_I_/d_V_ versus V) of the Ag/Mg1-_x_AlB2 point contacts were obtained by numerical differentiation of the measured _I-V_ characteristics, and presented clear structures due to Andreev reflection at the interface, in the form of conductance maxima whose positions give a rough indication of the gap amplitudes.

## Results and discussion

Figure 1 shows the resistivity as a function of temperature of the Mg1-_x_AlB2 samples with x = 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20. The critical temperature T_{c}, the residual resistivity r0, and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) are summarized in Table 1. We assume an error in the evaluation of resistivity of +-10% due to the uncertainty of the geometrical factor. Moreover, in polycrystals it is critically sensitive to sample density and effective percolation path between grains, which causes an overestimation of resistivity. On the other hand, scanning electron microscope images of our samples show a network of well connected grains,[19] so we assume a negligible contribution of grain boundaries.

The transition width gets larger for more heavily doped samples, where inhomogeneities are more likely to occur, but no multiple transitions were observed (see the inset of Fig. 1). The resistivity values are comparable with the ones reported for Al-doped single crystals,[20] indicating the excellent quality of this set of samples. r0 increases monotonically with the doping, ranging from 2.5 _m_O cm to 12 _m_O cm, apart from the x = 0.20 sample, made with 11B, which has a r0 value lower than the x = 0.10 and x = 0.15 samples.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline x ± _Δ_x_ & T_{c} ± _Δ_T__c_/2(K) & _ρ_β_(_μ_Δ_Č  Figure 2 shows, as an example, the magnetoresistivity curves of the x = 0.07 and 0.20 samples measured at a fixed field and varying the temperature. The upper critical field curve B_{c2}(T) was operatively defined as 90% of these curves. Our criterion provides the determination of the uppermost B_{c2}(T) curve, which is B_{c2lab} for the pure polycrystalline samples (Ref. [6] and references therein); in substituted compounds which present some inhomogeneities, our criterion probes the grains with a lower level of doping.

Increasing disorder in single-gap superconductors is usually accompanied by an increase in the upper critical field.[21] In the left panel of Fig. 3, B_{c2} is plotted as a function of temperature for all the samples considered here. As is clearly seen, B_{c2} monotonically decreases with increasing Al concentration; this monotonic trend is maintained even if B_{c2} is plotted as a function of the reduced temperature TT_{c}, as seen in the right panel of Fig. 3. Measurements on Al-doped single crystals show indeed that the critical field decreases with doping when the external field is parallel to the ab planes.[20] In Ref. [8], we showed that at a low level of doping (x < 0.1), this unusual behavior is explained assuming that, in spite of the disorder introduced by Al doping, the B_{c2} can be described within a clean-limit model.

In the clean limit, the critical fields of MgB_{2} at low temperature are determined by the \sigma bands.[22, 23] Thus, far from the transition, the critical fields perpendicular and parallel to the ab planes can be expressed in terms of the coherence lengths of the \sigma carriers in either direction, \xi_{0_{\sigma\,ab}} or \xi_{0_{\sigma\,c}}:

\[B_{c2\perp ab}(T) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{0_{\sigma\,ab}}(T)^{2}},\]

\[B_{c2|ab}(T) = \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{0_{\sigma\,ab}}(T)\xi_{0_{\sigma\,c}}(T)}.\]

By inserting \  ated by PCM, with the technique described above. Representative low-temperature conductance curves measured in Mg_{1-x}Al_{x}B_{2} samples with x=0, 0.1, and 0.2 are reported in Fig. 5. The fulfillment of the conditions for ballistic conduction across the junction (at least at 4.2 K) is witnessed by the rather flat background and the absence of the typical, strong "dips" that appear in the diffusive regime.[25] Due to the finite size of the Ag-paint spots, the ballistic regime can be accompanied by fairly low normal-state resistance values, because several parallel microjunctions are actually established between the normal metal and the superconductor, in different points of the apparent contact area. The conductance curves clearly show sharp maxima at energies related to the small gap, \Delta_{\sigma}--even though in the x=0.2 case these two peaks are so close that, even at 4.2 K, they cannot be resolved and appear as if they had merged in a single peak at zero bias. Smoother structures related to the large gap, \Delta_{\sigma}, are also present, such as a shoulder in the first two cases (x=0 and x=0.1) and a small peak in the third (x=0.2). The presence of these structures allows a rough evaluation of \Delta_{\sigma}, and ensures a greater reliability of the fitting procedure. In the inset of Fig. 6, for example, we report the experimental curve at x=0.2, after normalization (i.e., division by the normal-state conductance), together with its fit with the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model generalized to the two-band case[18, 26] (solid line), which gives an accurate evaluation of the gap amplitudes. In the main panel of Fig. 6, we plot the so-determined \Delta_{\sigma} and \Delta_{\pi} in a selected set of samples (x=0, 0.1, and 0.2). Because of the dominant contribution of the \pi bands to the conductance across the junction even in polycrystalline samples,[27, 28] the uncertainty on \Delta_{\sigma} is generally larger than that on \Delta_{\pi} as evidenced by the data summarized in Table 2. Note that \Delta_{\sigma} linearly decreases on increasing Al doping from 7.5 meV at x=0 to 3.8 meV at x=0.2, which is consistent with the position of the large-gap structures in the conductance curves of Fig. 5. The small gap \Delta_{\pi} (2.8 meV at x=0) shows a decrease in the whole doping range, becoming as small as 1.7 meV at x=0.2. In the same figure, we also show the results obtained by specific-heat measurements.[14] The overall agreement between the data as a function of doping is impressive considering the differences inherent to the two experimental techniques (heat capacity measures an average gap throughout the sample, while Andreev reflection probes the gap in a local area close to the surface). Thus PCM in Al-doped samples confirm the previous evidence[14] of the strong decrease of \Delta_{\sigma}, not accompanied by the predicted[13] rising of \Delta_{\pi}.

Once the Fermi velocities and the \sigma-band gap have been estimated as functions of Al doping, it should be possible to scale the experimental critical field curves according to Eq. (2b) (as previously remarked, our experimental values of B_{c2} must be compared with B_{c2[ab]}).

In fig. 7, we plot the rescaled critical fields,

\[B_{c2}^{res}(x)=B_{c2}(x)\frac{\Delta_{\sigma}(0)^{2}\,v_{F_{\sigma,ab}}(x)}{ \Delta_{\sigma}(x)^{2}\,v_{F_{\sigma,ab}}(0)}\frac{v_{F_{\sigma,c}}(x)}{v_{F_{\sigma,c}}(0)},\]

where B_{c2}(x) is the experimental critical field for each x value and \Delta_{\sigma}(x) is the linearly interpolated gap. Since B_{c2} is determined by the grains with the lowest doping, \Delta_{\sigma} was estimated, for each concentration, at the minimum doping in the range x\pm\Delta x of Table 1. The values of B_{c2}^{res} have to be compared with the experimental B_{c2}(0) curve (continuous line). The main source of uncertainty on B_{c2}^{res} comes from the

Figure 5: Examples of low-temperature (4.2 K) non-normalized (i.e., as-measured) conductance curves of Ag-spot point contacts on Mg_{1-x}Al_{x}B_{2} samples with (from bottom to top) x=0, x=0.1, and x=0.2. The straight dashed line indicates that the structure related to the large gap \Delta_{\sigma} (a shoulder in the first two cases, and a small peak in the third) moves toward lower energies on increasing the Al content. This is suggestive of the corresponding reduction in the value of the gap amplitude obtained from the fit of the normalized curves.

  ratio between the gaps, which varies by about a factor 2 in the considered range of x. All the curves fall together and overlap with the B_{c2}(0) curve within the experimental uncertainty. Therefore, we can reliably conclude that for x \leq 0.2, a description within a clean limit model works well.

Further support of our analysis comes from the comparison of the \sigma-band scattering rates, \Gamma_{\sigma}, with the energy gaps \Delta_{\sigma}. An estimation of \Gamma_{\sigma} can be made by assuming that the electrical conductivity of Al-doped samples is mainly determined by \sigma-band carriers. In fact, with the \sigma orbitals being localized around the B planes, \Gamma_{\sigma} is only slightly affected by substitution in the Mg planes.[4] This hypothesis, although reasonable, provides lower limits for \Gamma_{\sigma} values; however, even if it is relaxed, our conclusions are substantially unchanged. We assume

\[\rho_{0}_{\sigma}=\Gamma_{\sigma}/(\varepsilon_{0}\omega_{p_{\sigma}}^{2}) =\rho_{0},\] (3)

where \omega_{p_{\sigma}} is the spatially averaged \sigma-band plasma frequency and \varepsilon_{0} is the dielectric constant. The plasma frequencies are given by \omega_{p_{\sigma}}^{2} = 8\pi(\omega_{\sigma}/V_{cell})v_{F_{\sigma}}^{2} and can be calculated by taking into account the dependence on the Al content of the Fermi velocities, of the density of states N_{\sigma}, and of the unit cell volume V_{cell}. The values of \omega_{p_{\sigma}\,ab}, \omega_{p_{\sigma}\,c}, and \omega_{p_{\sigma}} =\left(\frac{2}{3}\omega_{p_{\sigma}\,ab}^{2} +\frac{1}{3}\omega_{p_{\sigma}\,c}^{2}\right)^{1/2} are reported in the lower panel of Fig. 4 as a function of Al doping. As is clearly seen, \omega_{p_{\sigma}} strongly decreases with the doping due to the filling of the \sigma bands. An estimation of \Gamma_{\sigma} for the various samples can be obtained from Eq. (3), using the experimental resistivity values and the calculated plasma frequencies. The results are given in Table I. The \Gamma_{\sigma} values weakly increase with Al concentration ranging from 7 to 13 meV. However, the increase of resistivity is mostly accounted for by the decrease of \omega_{p_{\sigma}}. Finally, in Table I the ratios

\[\frac{\Gamma_{\sigma}}{\pi\Delta_{\sigma}}=\frac{\hbar\,v_{F_{\sigma}}/\pi \Delta_{\sigma}}{\hbar\,v_{F_{\sigma}}/\Gamma_{\sigma}}=\frac{\xi_{0,\sigma}}{ l_{\sigma}}\]

are reported. The ratios \Gamma_{\sigma}/\pi\Delta_{\sigma} turn out to be lower than 1, confirming that the \sigma bands in Al-doped samples are in the clean limit for x \leq 0.2.

In conclusion, in this paper we have discussed the straightforward correlation existing between the critical fields and the \sigma-band gaps in Al-doped samples. Our main experimental evidence is that B_{c2} monotonically decreases with Al doping while the resistivity increases. On the other hand, we estimated a suppression of \Delta_{\sigma} with increasing Al doping. This complex phenomenology can be understood by assuming that Al substitution in the Mg sites suppresses the conduction of \pi bands, but only slightly affects the impurity scattering in \sigma bands. This makes the clean regime of \sigma bands particularly robust; in fact, up to x=0.2 the upper critical field can be well described within a clean-limit model and its decrease is directly related to the suppression of the superconducting \sigma gap.
