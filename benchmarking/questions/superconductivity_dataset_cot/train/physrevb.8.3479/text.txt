###### Abstract

The superconducting transition temperature for the alloys (Au\({}_{1-x}\)Pd\({}_{x}\))Ga\({}_{2}\) with \(x\) = 0, 0.012, and 0.024 has been measured as a function of hydrostatic pressure to 24 kbar. The very marked discontinuity in \(T_{e}\), which occurs at \(\sim\) 6 kbar for \(x\) = 0 is displaced to lower pressure and becomes considerably broader as \(x\) is increased. This behavior is discussed in terms of the Fermi-surface transition previously proposed to explain de Haas-van Alphen and NMR measurements.

An almost discontinuous increase of the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{e}\) for the compound AuGa\({}_{2}\) at a pressure of ~ 6 kbar was recently reported[1] by one of us. An abrupt change in the Fermi-surface topology was suggested as the cause of this behavior in support of the interpretation placed upon some earlier[1, 2] de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) measurements. The present investigation extends the pressure range of the \(T_{e}\) measurement from the ~ 8-kbar maximum available in the previous work to 24 kbar and also included an examination of the effect upon the pressure dependence of \(T_{e}\) of changing the electron concentration by substituting 1. 2 and 2. 4-at. % Pd (nominal) for the Au.

Samples were cut from the same single-crystal ingots as those for the dHvA measurements. A clamp arrangement, in which pressure was generated in a fluid-pressure medium at room temperature, provided pressure up to 24 kbar. The pressure at the low temperature was determined with a superconducting-tin monomer.[3] Pressures up to ~ 5 kbar were also applied to the Pd-doped samples by the isobaric freezing of helium, as in the initial measurements[1] on AuGa\({}_{2}\). The transition to the superconducting state was detected by a standard ac inductance technique in both pressure systems.

The variation of the superconducting transition temperature with pressure for the AuGa\({}_{2}\) and the Pd-substituted samples is shown in Fig. 1. The data from the earlier measurements on AuGa\({}_{2}\) have also been included and the two sets of measurements are in excellent agreement. With the exception of the values close to 6 kbar using the clamp technique, \(T_{e}\) is taken to be the midpoint of the central linear portion of the superconducting transition curve. The curves obtained for AuGa\({}_{2}\) in the clamp broadened considerably in the vicinity of the sudden increase in \(T_{e}\), with the spread of the transition curves being consistent with a continuum of transition temperatures distributed over the range of the discontinuity in \(T_{e}\). The deviation from a homogeneous pressure distribution within the transmitting medium could possibly be as much as 0.3 kbar at low temperature, which would be sufficient to account for the broadening of the transition curves near the abrupt change in \(T_{e}\). However, the onset of the superconducting transition remained sharp and agrees well with the \(T_{e}\) values obtained by pressuring with helium, where there was much less broadening (\(\leq\) 40 mK), presumably because of superior hydrostatic pressure conditions at the low temperature. At higher pressure the transition curves sharpened again, ultimately attaining widths[4] of ~ 5 mK, making them sharper than the initial zero-pressure and low-pressure curves which had widths of 10-15 mK. This sharpening of the transition curves presumably reflects the decrease in the sensitivity of the transition temperature to pressure above the discontinuity.

Further, notable features of the transitions for

The different symbols distinguish the value of \(x\) and the pressure system in which the measurements were made as follows; \(x\) = 0, \(\Delta\) –helium, O –clamp; \(x\) = 0.012, + –helium, \(x\) –clamp; \(x\) = 0.024, \(\nabla\) –helium, \(\square\) –clamp.

 AuGa2 observed at pressures above 15 kbar were a well resolved and reproducible supercooling of ~ 5 mK for decreasing temperature and a marked differential paramagnetic effect (DPE) upon warming back through the transition. The DPE is characteristic of samples which are magnetically reversible.5 The supercooling would indicate that AuGa2 is a type-I superconductor, consistent with its ratio of Debye temperature to _T_e of ~ 170. Thus, in spite of any inhomogeneity in strain distribution introduced into the sample as a consequence of the application of pressures in excess of 15 kbar, it would appear that the magnetic reversibility of the sample has been improved relative to its behavior at zero and low pressures.

The transitions for the Pd-doped samples, where the change in _T_e with pressure is much less abrupt than for the pure AuGa2, did not exhibit any pressure broadening, but did become sharper at higher pressure, particularly in the case of the 2, 4-at, % sample where the zero-pressure transition width of ~ 50 mK decreased to ~ 5 mK at 19 kbar. Supercooling was not observed for the Pd-doped samples, but a DPE, less pronounced than that for the pure AuGa2, was seen at pressures in excess of 10 kbar.

The _T_e measurements for the Pd-substituted samples made in the helium system were taken in conjunction with a NMR study8 and a small adjustment to the measured _T_e value (~ 60 mK) was necessary to correct for the residual field (~ 10 G) of the electromagnet. The corrections required to bring the zero-pressure _T_e values, determined in the two pressure systems, into agreement are consistent with estimates based upon rough values7 for the zero-temperature critical field.

The rapid change in the zero pressure _T_e and an accompanying change in the coefficient of the electronic specific heat, \(g\), when Pd is substituted for Au in AuGa2, was reported by Wernick _et al._7 who suggested a change in the relative position of the energy bands as a possible explanation of this behavior. A change in the character of the electrons at the Fermi surface from _b_-like to _s_-like in going from low temperature to room temperature had been proposed8 earlier to account for the anomalous temperature dependence of the Ga71 Knight shift in AuGa2. These suggestions were subsequently substantiated by the band-structure calculation of Switendick and Narath9 which predicted a very flat portion of the second-zone energy band, of strong Ga 4s character, lying just below the Fermi level. Thus, even a small reduction in electron concentration would place the Fermi energy in a region of high density of states and would account for the observed increases in _T_e and \(g\). A thermal depopulation of this band, rather than its movement with temperature, provides the most consistent description of the NMR results.8,9 Recent dHvA1,8 and NMR6 measurements, taken as a function of pressure, as well as the band-structure calculations as a function of pressure,2 show that this band moves up relative to the Fermi energy as the volume is decreased. The almost discontinuous change of _T_e at ~ 6 kbar was then associated with the passage of the band through the Fermi level.1

It can be seen from Fig. 1 that a small substitution of Pd for Au significantly displaces the peak in _T_e towards lower pressure and broadens it considerably. This displacement is consistent with the above picture of a lowering of the Fermi level by Pd substitution and thus a reduction of the relative shift of the second-zone band required to cross it. The sharpness of the peak in _T_e for the AuGa2 and its subsequent broadening with addition of Pd, points to a very strong singularity in the density of states, which is smeared out by electron scattering.

Changes in the Fermi-surface topology, much less dramatic than that considered here, have been held responsible for relatively small contributions (typically \(\Delta T_{e}\)~ 20 mk) to the pressure dependence of _T_e in several elements and alloys.10 These small changes are observable because of the exponential dependence of _T_e on the product of the density of states and the electron-phonon interaction. Since the Knight Shift for AuGa2, which can be considered in this context to be proportional to the density of states alone, is observed8 to
