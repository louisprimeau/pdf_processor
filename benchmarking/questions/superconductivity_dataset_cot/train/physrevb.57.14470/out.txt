###### Abstract

The temperature dependence of the specific heat of Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO samples in the overdoped region has been measured between 1.5 and 8 K. Specific-heat anomalies were observed at T_{c} in two superconducting samples, while no anomalies were observed in a nonsuperconducting one. The values of \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} were quite small in comparison to the BCS value, and the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state near T_{c} exhibited a weak temperature dependence. These findings are consistent with the impurity effects predicted by the model of d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki. Furthermore, we found that the Sommerfeld constant \gamma increases with increasing doped carrier from the superconducting region to the normal metal region, in contrast to the case of La2_{-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}.

## 1 Introduction

When clarifying the mechanism of high-T_{c} cuprates, the symmetry of Cooper paring must be determined. Several different experiments involving angle-resolved photoemission,[1; 2] the tricrystal superconducting ring,[3] NMR,[4] and the specific heat[5; 6] have revealed that high-T_{c} cuprates behave as d-wave superconductors. Theories of d-wave superconductors[7; 8; 9; 10; 11] predict that the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm d} is proportional to T^{2} at T{\ll}T_{c} . Furthermore, Maki and Won[12] have shown that as the impurity content increases, the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el} changes from the T^{2} type to the (aT{+}bT^{3}) type. This behavior is quite different from the exponential dependence of C_{\rm el} presented by BCS theory. In fact, Momono _et al.[5; 6]_ have observed that the temperature dependence of the C_{\rm el} of La2_{-x}Sr_{x}Cu1_{-y}Zn_{y}O_{4} is proportional to T^{2} at T{\ll}T_{c} for low concentrations of Zn, while for high concentrations of Zn, the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el} is described well by the sum of the aT and bT^{3} terms. Thus the features of the electronic specific heat at T{\ll}T_{c} have been theoretically and experimentally clarified.

Compared to the behavior of C_{\rm el} at T{\ll}T_{c} in d-wave superconductors, few studies have examined the behavior of C_{\rm el} near T_{c} . Sun and Maki[10] have shown theoretically that for the C_{\rm el} near T_{c} for d-wave superconductors, the value of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} , \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} , is significantly smaller than the BCS value (\Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} = 1.43) and decreases markedly with increasing impurity content. Here \Delta\,C is the jump in C_{\rm el} at T_{c} and \gamma is the Sommerfeld constant. The measurement of \Delta\,C is also important for the determination of the pairing symmetry and plays a significant role in the phase transition from the pseudogap state to the superconducting state. The existence of the pseudogap is well known in high-T_{c} cuprates,[2; 13] especially in the underdoped region, where the formation of the pseudogap starts at a temperature well above T_{c} , increases in magnitude with decreasing temperature, and then finally agrees with the superconducting gap at T_{c} .[2] Therefore, the finite superconducting gap is already open at T_{c} , which is clearly different from the normal superconducting transition. To investigate the specific-heat anomaly at the superconducting transition from the pseudogap state, we first need to clarify the behavior of the jump in C_{\rm el} at the superconducting transition from the normal state without the pseudogap for the d-wave superconductor.

To determine experimentally the value of \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} for high-T_{c} cuprates, it is important to use samples with low T_{c} (\sim 10 K), because in superconductors with a relatively high T_{c} of above 30 K, a contribution of the electronic term to the whole specific heat is so small that it is difficult to simultaneously determine \Delta\,C and \gamma. Among high-T_{c} cuprates, the Bi2Sr2CuO_{y} system is known to undergo the superconducting transition at low temperature (T_{c}\sim 10 K). So far, several groups[14; 15; 16] have reported the temperature dependence of the specific heat through the T_{c} of Bi2Sr2CuO_{y} systems. Yamada _et al.[14]_ and Yu and Frank[15] have observed no anomalies in the specific heat at T_{c} , while Nyeanchi _et al.[16]_ have observed a significantly large jump in the specific heat at T_{c} . Since some contradictions exist among their results, the value of \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} has not yet been experimentally defined.

In the present paper, we report the specific-heat anomalies observed at T_{c} in the overdoped region of Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO_{y} where the pseudogap is not formed above T_{c} . The values of \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} were significantly smaller and the temperature dependence of the C_{\rm el} below T_{c} was markedly weaker compared with those observed in the BCS superconductor. These results are consistent with the effect of impurities predicted in the model of d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki.[10] Using the specific-heat anomalies at T_{c} and the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el} in the superconducting state near T_{c} , we show that the superconducting Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO_{y} in the overdoped region is a d-wave superconductor. In addition, the relationship between T_{c} , \gamma, and carrier concentration in the overdoped region of Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO_{y} behaves differently from that of the La2_{-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system.[5]

## 2 Experiments

The Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO_{y} sample was prepared from Bi2O3, PbO2, SrCO3, and CuO powders of 99.99-99.99 % purity using a solid state reaction. The powders were mixed for 2 h and calcined at 815 degC for 8 h. The reacted material was ground and pressed into pellets 13 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick. The pellets were finally sintered to form the Bi18Pb03Sr19CuO3 single phase at 840 degC for 30 h in air. The formation of the single phase was confirmed by x-ray diffraction with Cu _K_a_ radiation. The resistivity measurement showed that the sintered sample was metallic, but not superconducting (nonsuperconducting sample). The superconducting sample was made from the nonsuperconducting sample by annealing at 450 degC for 700 h in an argon atmosphere. The superconductivity was determined by magnetic and electrical measurement. The magnetic susceptibility was measured between 1.5 and 15 K under a magnetic field of 0.5 G using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) susceptometer. The resistivity was measured between 5 and 300 K using the four-probe method. The specific heat was measured by the thermal relaxation method in the temperature range from 1.5 to 8 K. The quantity of the samples used in the specific-heat measurement was about 15 mg.

## III Results and Discussion

The formation of the single phase was confirmed by x-ray diffraction. The lattice constants (_a_ = 5.382 A, b = 5.326 A, c = 24.627 A) of the nonsuperconducting sample agreed with those previously reported.17

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization of Bi18Pb03Sr19CuO3. The open triangle and circle correspond to the data of the sample sintered in air (No. 121N sample) and that of the sample annealed in an argon atmosphere (No. 121S sample), respectively. The Meissner signal observed in the No. 121S sample was about 20% of the ideal value, which ensures the bulk nature of the superconductivity. From the onset of the Meissner signal, T_{c} was determined to be 4.7 K. Conversely, there is no indication of superconductivity for the No. 121N sample. This result demonstrates that the No. 121N sample is nonsuperconducting in the overdoped region, because the superconducting No. 121S sample was prepared by a reduction of carriers from the No. 121N sample.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the No. 121N and No. 121S samples. The resistivity of the No. 121N sample decreases with decreasing temperature. No rapid decrease in resistivity is observed in the temperature region above 4.2 K. On the other hand, the resistivity of the No. 121S sample decreases rapidly near the temperature corresponding to the onset of the Meissner signal, although the temperature dependence of the resistivity in the high-temperature range is almost the same as that of the No. 121N sample. The temperature dependences of resistivity at low temperature for both samples are consistent with the result of the Meissner signal shown in Fig. 1. The temperature dependence of resistivity for the No. 121N sample shows negative curvature, which is a common feature for samples in the overdoped region.18,19 In the present study, the temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits negative curvature, even for the No. 121S sample, although this dependence is weaker than that seen for the No. 121N sample. This indicates that the No. 121S sample remains in the overdoped region when the carrier is reduced from the No. 121N sample in the overdoped region. Thus both No. 121N and No. 121S samples are in the overdoped region.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the No. 121N sample in which _C/T_ is plotted as a function of T2. As temperature decreases, the specific heat decreases smoothly without any anomalies, but cannot be described as a straight line of _C/T_ = g + _bT_2 as shown in Fig. 3(a). The deviation from the straight line is observed in both the low- and high-temperature ranges, indicating that the specific heat of the No. 121N sample cannot be simply represented by only two terms of the electronic specific heat (_gT_3).

Assuming that the deviation in the low-temperature range is Schottky-type specific heat (_A/T_2) due to magnetic impurities and that the deviation in the high-temperature range is the contribution from anharmonic lattice vibration (_bT_5), the specific heat of the No. 121N sample is represented well by the following equation:

\[C = \gamma T + \beta T^{3} + \delta T^{5} + A/T^{2}.\]

The values of each coefficient calculated by Eq. (1) are g = 8.7 (mJ/mol K2), b = 1.8 (mJ/mol K4), d = 1.5 x 10-2 (mJ/mol K6), and A = 31.1 (mJ/mol K-1). Using these values, the temperature dependence of each contribution to the

  specific heat is calculated. In Fig. 3(b) the results are represented by the solid lines. We find that the contribution of the lattice specific heat (\beta T^{3}\!+\!\delta T^{5}) to the total is significantly larger than the others, especially in the high-temperature range above 5 K, where it is over 80%.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of electronic specific heat C_{\rm el}, which is obtained by subtracting the contributions of lattice specific heat and Schottky-type specific heat (A/T^{2}) from the total specific heat (C). The C_{\rm el}/T obtained is constant within 8.7\pm1.9 (mJ/mol K^{2}) over the whole temperature range measured. Wide scattering in the data of the electronic specific heat may be due to the large contribution of the lattice terms to the total specific heat.

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the superconducting sample (No. 1215) in which C/T is plotted as a function of T^{2}. As a whole, the C/T versus T^{2} curve is similar to that obtained for the nonsuperconducting sample (No. 121N) except that a hump appeared around 4.5 K. In the inset of Fig. 5 in which d(C/T)/d(T^{2}) is plotted as a function of T^{2}, a dip is clearly evident around T^{2}\!=\!23 K^{2} and the corresponding temperature agrees with T_{c}\!=\!4.7 K. This indicates that the hump is the specific-heat anomaly due to the superconducting transition. The specific-heat anomaly with the hump is also observed in our other superconducting sample (No. 123S) with T_{c}\!=\!4.8 K. Our result of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} disagrees with the earlier works of Yamada _et al._, [14] Yu and Frank, [15] and Nycanli _et al._, [16] Yamada _et al._, [14] and Yu and Frank [15] have reported that no anomaly in the specific heat appears at T_{c} in the Bi_{21}Sr_{1.85}CuO_{6-\delta} and Bi_{2.05}Pb_{0.05}Sr_{1.5}CuO_{6+\delta} systems, respectively, although the Meissner signal is observed at T_{c} . On the other hand, Nyeanchi _et al._[16] have reported a significantly large jump in the specific heat at T_{c} in the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} system, whose value is one order larger than that observed here. These discrepancies will be discussed later in connection with the temperature dependence of the specific heat.

In order to obtain each contribution to the total specific heat, the temperature dependence of the specific heat was fitted using Eq. (1) except for the temperature range near T_{c} where the specific-heat anomaly appears. The values obtained were \gamma\!=\!6.0 (mJ/mol K^{2}), \beta\!=\!2.1 (mJ/mol K^{4}), \delta\!=\!1.1\!\times\!10^{-2} (mJ/mol K^{6}), and A\!=\!40.0 (mJ/mol K^{-1}). It is worth comparing the values obtained here with those reported previously by Yamada _et al._[14] and Yu and Frank, [15] because the temperature range measured is almost the same (from 1.5 to ca. 10 K) and the temperature dependence of C is well represented by Eq. (1) or by an equation of C\!=\!\gamma T + \beta T^{3}\!+\!A/T^{2}. Our value for A is less than half of their values, although values for \gamma, \beta, and \delta are almost the same.

  This suggests a small amount of magnetic impurity in our samples, which may have resulted in the appearance of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} . On the other hand, Nycanchi _et al._[16] have reported that the C measured from 0.1 to 5 K is represented well by the equation C = aT^{n} + \beta T^{3} + A/T^{2} with n = 0.75. However, because the temperature range measured and the temperature dependence of C in their study differ markedly from ours, no direct comparison can be made. At the present time, therefore, the reason for anomalous large jump in C at T_{c} reported by Nyeanchi _et al._[16] remains unclear.

The C_{\rm el} of the superconducting sample (No. 121S) was evaluated by subtracting the contributions of lattice and Schottky anomalies from the total specific heat, which is the same method used for the nonsuperconducting sample. Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el}/T of No. 121S. The data show scattering due to a large contribution of lattice specific heat as in the case of the nonsuperconducting sample. However, we see that the C_{\rm el}/T changes significantly around T_{c} ; above T_{c} , C_{\rm el}/T ( = \gamma) is constant within 6.0 \pm 1.4 (mJ/mol K^{2}), but at T_{c} a rapid increase in C_{\rm el} is observed. When the shape of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} is approximated as a step, the value of the specific-heat jump \Delta C is estimated to be 17.2 (mJ/mol K) and, correspondingly, \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} is 0.60. The value of \Delta C is clearly larger than the scattering of C_{\rm el} measured in the normal state. A similar result was obtained for our other superconducting sample (No. 123S) as shown in Fig. 6(b), in which the values for \Delta C and \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} are 15.6 (mJ/mol K) and 0.55, respectively. These results indicate that the anomaly in C_{\rm el} observed here is due to the superconducting transition of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{3}. Notably, the value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} obtained here is quite small, less than half of the BCS value (1.43).

The theory of d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki[10] can be used to help explain the small value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} . They investigated theoretically the relationship between C_{s}/\gamma T_{c0} and T/T_{c0}, where C_{s} , \gamma, and T_{c0} are the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state, the Sommerfeld constant, and the superconducting transition temperature in the absence of impurities, respectively. Their result shows that the magnitudes of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} and T_{c} decrease remarkably with increasing impurities. The calculated value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} is very small (0.95) even for a clean d-wave superconductor compared to the BCS value (1.43) and decreases to 0.5 for samples containing impurities with \Gamma/\Delta_{00} = 0.2, where \Gamma is given by the ratio [\Gamma = n_{i}/\pi N(0)] of the impurity concentration n_{i} and the density of states at the Fermi energy per spin, N(0) , and \Delta_{00} is the energy gap at T = 0 K for a clean d-wave superconductor. Our small value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} ( = 0.55 - 0.60) just lies on impurity concentrations of between \Gamma/\Delta_{00}= 0.1 and 0.2. Since the Schottky anomaly observed in the specific heat suggests the existence of magnetic impurities in our sample, our experimental results are consistent with the theoretical ones for the impurity effects on d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki.[10]

To compare our experimental result on the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el}/\gamma T in the superconducting state with the theoretical behavior proposed by Sun and Maki, C_{\rm el}/\gamma T as a function of the normalized temperature T/T_{c} was recalculated for various impurity contents using the relationship between C_{s}/\gamma T_{c0} and T/T_{c0} shown by Sun and Maki (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 10). In Fig. 7, the calculated results are shown with our experimental result and show that the temperature depen

Figure 7: Normalized temperature dependence of the ratio of the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state and \gamma T for various concentrations of impurities. The solid lines represent the results calculated using the theory of Sun and Maki (Ref. 10). The values of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} are 0.95, 0.77, 0.57, and 0.34 for \Gamma/\Delta_{00}= 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. The electronic specific heat for the Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{3} superconducting sample (No. 121S) is shown as open circles.

  dence of C_{\rm d}/\gamma T becomes weak with increasing impurity concentration. Our result near T_{c} agrees with the calculated one between \Gamma/\Delta_{00}= 0.1 and 0.2, although it deviates from the theoretical results in the low-temperature region due to the influence of the Schottky anomaly. The temperature dependence of C_{\rm d}/\gamma T in the superconducting state is also consistent with the impurity effects for d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki,[10] in addition to the result of the jump in C_{\rm d} at T_{c} . Thus the jump in C_{\rm d} at T_{c} and the temperature dependence of C_{\rm d} near T_{c} as well as the temperature dependence of C_{\rm d} at T\llT_{c},[5, 6] which has been reported previously, argue for high-T_{c} cuprates being d-wave superconductors.

Next, we discuss the relationship between T_{c} , \gamma, and doped carrier content. According to the results obtained by Yamada _et al._,[14] as the carrier content increases from the underdoped region to the overdoped one, T_{c} increases initially and then decreases; it shows the typical curve of T_{c} versus carrier in high-T_{c} cuprates, while \gamma increases smoothly with increasing carrier (see Figs. 6 and 8 in Ref. [14]). In our case, as shown in Figs. 4 and 6, the value of \gamma of the superconducting sample is smaller than that of the nonsuperconducting sample. Since our superconducting sample in the overdoped region was produced by the reduction of carriers from the nonsuperconducting sample, \gamma increases with increasing doped carrier in contrast with the decrease in T_{c} . Thus we find that our result of the relationship between T_{c} , \gamma, and carrier content is in good agreement with that obtained by Yamada _et al.[14]_ Therefore, in the nonsuperconducting overdoped region of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} , \gamma increases with increasing carrier content. This is inconsistent with the result[5] in the nonsuperconducting overdoped region of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, in which \gamma decreases with increasing carrier content. This suggests that the relationship between \gamma and carrier content is not given universally, at least in the overdoped region of high-T_{c} cuprates.

Finally, it should be emphasized that the specific-heat anomaly obtained here is due to the superconducting transition from the normal state, but not from the pseudogap state. If the superconducting transition occurs in the underdoped region where the pseudogap state is formed well above T_{c} , the behavior of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} might be different from the behavior predicted by the Sun-Maki theory[10] which applies to a d-wave superconductor without the pseudogap. It is widely accepted that understanding the pseudogap is important in relation to the mechanism of high-T_{c} cuprates. However, at present, the specific-heat anomaly at the superconducting transition from the pseudogap state is not sufficiently clear. We believe that the present result will give us a starting point to investigate superconductivity from the pseudogap state. Current research is focusing on the specific-heat measurement of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} in the underdoped region.

## IV Conclusion

We have investigated the temperature dependence of the specific heat of superconducting and nonsuperconducting samples of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} in the overdoped region. The temperature dependence of the specific heat of the nonsuperconducting sample is accurately presented as C= \gamma T+ \beta T^{3} + \beta T^{5}+ A/T^{2}, while in the superconducting sample, a specific-heat anomaly is observed at T_{c} , in addition to the temperature dependence of C seen for the nonsuperconducting sample. The magnitude of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} , \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} , is 0.55-0.60, which is less than half of the BCS value. The electronic specific heat in the superconducting state near T_{c} shows a weak temperature dependence compared with BCS behavior. The quite small value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} and the weak temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state are consistent with the effects of impurities predicted by the model of d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki. These findings demonstrate that superconducting Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} in the overdoped region is a d-wave superconductor.

The value of \gamma for the superconducting sample was smaller than that for the nonsuperconducting sample; that is, \gamma increased with increasing doped carrier, because the superconducting sample was prepared by the reduction of carrier content from the nonsuperconducting sample. The relationship between T_{c} , \gamma, and carrier concentration in the overdoped region of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} shows behavior that contrasts with the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system. This suggests that the relationship between T_{c} and carrier content is similar for many high-T_{c} cuprates, but that between \gamma and carrier content is not.

###### Abstract

The temperature dependence of the specific heat of Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO samples in the overdoped region has been measured between 1.5 and 8 K. Specific-heat anomalies were observed at T_{c} in two superconducting samples, while no anomalies were observed in a nonsuperconducting one. The values of \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} were quite small in comparison to the BCS value, and the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state near T_{c} exhibited a weak temperature dependence. These findings are consistent with the impurity effects predicted by the model of d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki. Furthermore, we found that the Sommerfeld constant \gamma increases with increasing doped carrier from the superconducting region to the normal metal region, in contrast to the case of La2_{-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}.

When clarifying the mechanism of high-T_{c} cuprates, the symmetry of Cooper paring must be determined. Several different experiments involving angle-resolved photoemission,[1; 2] the tricrystal superconducting ring,[3] NMR,[4] and the specific heat[5; 6] have revealed that high-T_{c} cuprates behave as d-wave superconductors. Theories of d-wave superconductors[7; 8; 9; 10; 11] predict that the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\rm d} is proportional to T^{2} at T{\ll}T_{c} . Furthermore, Maki and Won[12] have shown that as the impurity content increases, the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el} changes from the T^{2} type to the (aT{+}bT^{3}) type. This behavior is quite different from the exponential dependence of C_{\rm el} presented by BCS theory. In fact, Momono _et al.[5; 6]_ have observed that the temperature dependence of the C_{\rm el} of La2_{-x}Sr_{x}Cu1_{-y}Zn_{y}O_{4} is proportional to T^{2} at T{\ll}T_{c} for low concentrations of Zn, while for high concentrations of Zn, the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el} is described well by the sum of the aT and bT^{3} terms. Thus the features of the electronic specific heat at T{\ll}T_{c} have been theoretically and experimentally clarified.

Compared to the behavior of C_{\rm el} at T{\ll}T_{c} in d-wave superconductors, few studies have examined the behavior of C_{\rm el} near T_{c} . Sun and Maki[10] have shown theoretically that for the C_{\rm el} near T_{c} for d-wave superconductors, the value of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} , \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} , is significantly smaller than the BCS value (\Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} = 1.43) and decreases markedly with increasing impurity content. Here \Delta\,C is the jump in C_{\rm el} at T_{c} and \gamma is the Sommerfeld constant. The measurement of \Delta\,C is also important for the determination of the pairing symmetry and plays a significant role in the phase transition from the pseudogap state to the superconducting state. The existence of the pseudogap is well known in high-T_{c} cuprates,[2; 13] especially in the underdoped region, where the formation of the pseudogap starts at a temperature well above T_{c} , increases in magnitude with decreasing temperature, and then finally agrees with the superconducting gap at T_{c} .[2] Therefore, the finite superconducting gap is already open at T_{c} , which is clearly different from the normal superconducting transition. To investigate the specific-heat anomaly at the superconducting transition from the pseudogap state, we first need to clarify the behavior of the jump in C_{\rm el} at the superconducting transition from the normal state without the pseudogap for the d-wave superconductor.

To determine experimentally the value of \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} for high-T_{c} cuprates, it is important to use samples with low T_{c} (\sim 10 K), because in superconductors with a relatively high T_{c} of above 30 K, a contribution of the electronic term to the whole specific heat is so small that it is difficult to simultaneously determine \Delta\,C and \gamma. Among high-T_{c} cuprates, the Bi2Sr2CuO_{y} system is known to undergo the superconducting transition at low temperature (T_{c}\sim 10 K). So far, several groups[14; 15; 16] have reported the temperature dependence of the specific heat through the T_{c} of Bi2Sr2CuO_{y} systems. Yamada _et al.[14]_ and Yu and Frank[15] have observed no anomalies in the specific heat at T_{c} , while Nyeanchi _et al.[16]_ have observed a significantly large jump in the specific heat at T_{c} . Since some contradictions exist among their results, the value of \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} has not yet been experimentally defined.

In the present paper, we report the specific-heat anomalies observed at T_{c} in the overdoped region of Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO_{y} where the pseudogap is not formed above T_{c} . The values of \Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c} were significantly smaller and the temperature dependence of the C_{\rm el} below T_{c} was markedly weaker compared with those observed in the BCS superconductor. These results are consistent with the effect of impurities predicted in the model of d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki.[10] Using the specific-heat anomalies at T_{c} and the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el} in the superconducting state near T_{c} , we show that the superconducting Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO_{y} in the overdoped region is a d-wave superconductor. In addition, the relationship between T_{c} , \gamma, and carrier concentration in the overdoped region of Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO_{y} behaves differently from that of the La2_{-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system.[5]

## 2 Experiments

The Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr1.9CuO_{y} sample was prepared from Bi2O3, PbO2, SrCO3, and CuO powders of 99.99-99.99 % purity using a solid state reaction. The powders were mixed for 2 h and calcined at 815 degC for 8 h. The reacted material was ground and pressed into pellets 13 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick. The pellets were finally sintered to form the Bi18Pb03Sr19CuO3 single phase at 840 degC for 30 h in air. The formation of the single phase was confirmed by x-ray diffraction with Cu _K_a_ radiation. The resistivity measurement showed that the sintered sample was metallic, but not superconducting (nonsuperconducting sample). The superconducting sample was made from the nonsuperconducting sample by annealing at 450 degC for 700 h in an argon atmosphere. The superconductivity was determined by magnetic and electrical measurement. The magnetic susceptibility was measured between 1.5 and 15 K under a magnetic field of 0.5 G using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) susceptometer. The resistivity was measured between 5 and 300 K using the four-probe method. The specific heat was measured by the thermal relaxation method in the temperature range from 1.5 to 8 K. The quantity of the samples used in the specific-heat measurement was about 15 mg.

## III Results and Discussion

The formation of the single phase was confirmed by x-ray diffraction. The lattice constants (_a_ = 5.382 A, b = 5.326 A, c = 24.627 A) of the nonsuperconducting sample agreed with those previously reported.17

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization of Bi18Pb03Sr19CuO3. The open triangle and circle correspond to the data of the sample sintered in air (No. 121N sample) and that of the sample annealed in an argon atmosphere (No. 121S sample), respectively. The Meissner signal observed in the No. 121S sample was about 20% of the ideal value, which ensures the bulk nature of the superconductivity. From the onset of the Meissner signal, T_{c} was determined to be 4.7 K. Conversely, there is no indication of superconductivity for the No. 121N sample. This result demonstrates that the No. 121N sample is nonsuperconducting in the overdoped region, because the superconducting No. 121S sample was prepared by a reduction of carriers from the No. 121N sample.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the No. 121N and No. 121S samples. The resistivity of the No. 121N sample decreases with decreasing temperature. No rapid decrease in resistivity is observed in the temperature region above 4.2 K. On the other hand, the resistivity of the No. 121S sample decreases rapidly near the temperature corresponding to the onset of the Meissner signal, although the temperature dependence of the resistivity in the high-temperature range is almost the same as that of the No. 121N sample. The temperature dependences of resistivity at low temperature for both samples are consistent with the result of the Meissner signal shown in Fig. 1. The temperature dependence of resistivity for the No. 121N sample shows negative curvature, which is a common feature for samples in the overdoped region.18,19 In the present study, the temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits negative curvature, even for the No. 121S sample, although this dependence is weaker than that seen for the No. 121N sample. This indicates that the No. 121S sample remains in the overdoped region when the carrier is reduced from the No. 121N sample in the overdoped region. Thus both No. 121N and No. 121S samples are in the overdoped region.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the No. 121N sample in which _C/T_ is plotted as a function of T2. As temperature decreases, the specific heat decreases smoothly without any anomalies, but cannot be described as a straight line of _C/T_ = g + _bT_2 as shown in Fig. 3(a). The deviation from the straight line is observed in both the low- and high-temperature ranges, indicating that the specific heat of the No. 121N sample cannot be simply represented by only two terms of the electronic specific heat (_gT_3).

Assuming that the deviation in the low-temperature range is Schottky-type specific heat (_A/T_2) due to magnetic impurities and that the deviation in the high-temperature range is the contribution from anharmonic lattice vibration (_bT_5), the specific heat of the No. 121N sample is represented well by the following equation:

\[C = \gamma T + \beta T^{3} + \delta T^{5} + A/T^{2}.\]

The values of each coefficient calculated by Eq. (1) are g = 8.7 (mJ/mol K2), b = 1.8 (mJ/mol K4), d = 1.5 x 10-2 (mJ/mol K6), and A = 31.1 (mJ/mol K-1). Using these values, the temperature dependence of each contribution to the

  specific heat is calculated. In Fig. 3(b) the results are represented by the solid lines. We find that the contribution of the lattice specific heat (\beta T^{3}\!+\!\delta T^{5}) to the total is significantly larger than the others, especially in the high-temperature range above 5 K, where it is over 80%.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of electronic specific heat C_{\rm el}, which is obtained by subtracting the contributions of lattice specific heat and Schottky-type specific heat (A/T^{2}) from the total specific heat (C). The C_{\rm el}/T obtained is constant within 8.7\pm1.9 (mJ/mol K^{2}) over the whole temperature range measured. Wide scattering in the data of the electronic specific heat may be due to the large contribution of the lattice terms to the total specific heat.

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the superconducting sample (No. 1215) in which C/T is plotted as a function of T^{2}. As a whole, the C/T versus T^{2} curve is similar to that obtained for the nonsuperconducting sample (No. 121N) except that a hump appeared around 4.5 K. In the inset of Fig. 5 in which d(C/T)/d(T^{2}) is plotted as a function of T^{2}, a dip is clearly evident around T^{2}\!=\!23 K^{2} and the corresponding temperature agrees with T_{c}\!=\!4.7 K. This indicates that the hump is the specific-heat anomaly due to the superconducting transition. The specific-heat anomaly with the hump is also observed in our other superconducting sample (No. 123S) with T_{c}\!=\!4.8 K. Our result of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} disagrees with the earlier works of Yamada _et al._, [14] Yu and Frank, [15] and Nycanli _et al._, [16] Yamada _et al._, [14] and Yu and Frank [15] have reported that no anomaly in the specific heat appears at T_{c} in the Bi_{21}Sr_{1.85}CuO_{6-\delta} and Bi_{2.05}Pb_{0.05}Sr_{1.5}CuO_{6+\delta} systems, respectively, although the Meissner signal is observed at T_{c} . On the other hand, Nyeanchi _et al._[16] have reported a significantly large jump in the specific heat at T_{c} in the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} system, whose value is one order larger than that observed here. These discrepancies will be discussed later in connection with the temperature dependence of the specific heat.

In order to obtain each contribution to the total specific heat, the temperature dependence of the specific heat was fitted using Eq. (1) except for the temperature range near T_{c} where the specific-heat anomaly appears. The values obtained were \gamma\!=\!6.0 (mJ/mol K^{2}), \beta\!=\!2.1 (mJ/mol K^{4}), \delta\!=\!1.1\!\times\!10^{-2} (mJ/mol K^{6}), and A\!=\!40.0 (mJ/mol K^{-1}). It is worth comparing the values obtained here with those reported previously by Yamada _et al._[14] and Yu and Frank, [15] because the temperature range measured is almost the same (from 1.5 to ca. 10 K) and the temperature dependence of C is well represented by Eq. (1) or by an equation of C\!=\!\gamma T + \beta T^{3}\!+\!A/T^{2}. Our value for A is less than half of their values, although values for \gamma, \beta, and \delta are almost the same.

  This suggests a small amount of magnetic impurity in our samples, which may have resulted in the appearance of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} . On the other hand, Nycanchi _et al._[16] have reported that the C measured from 0.1 to 5 K is represented well by the equation C = aT^{n} + \beta T^{3} + A/T^{2} with n = 0.75. However, because the temperature range measured and the temperature dependence of C in their study differ markedly from ours, no direct comparison can be made. At the present time, therefore, the reason for anomalous large jump in C at T_{c} reported by Nyeanchi _et al._[16] remains unclear.

The C_{\rm el} of the superconducting sample (No. 121S) was evaluated by subtracting the contributions of lattice and Schottky anomalies from the total specific heat, which is the same method used for the nonsuperconducting sample. Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el}/T of No. 121S. The data show scattering due to a large contribution of lattice specific heat as in the case of the nonsuperconducting sample. However, we see that the C_{\rm el}/T changes significantly around T_{c} ; above T_{c} , C_{\rm el}/T ( = \gamma) is constant within 6.0 \pm 1.4 (mJ/mol K^{2}), but at T_{c} a rapid increase in C_{\rm el} is observed. When the shape of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} is approximated as a step, the value of the specific-heat jump \Delta C is estimated to be 17.2 (mJ/mol K) and, correspondingly, \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} is 0.60. The value of \Delta C is clearly larger than the scattering of C_{\rm el} measured in the normal state. A similar result was obtained for our other superconducting sample (No. 123S) as shown in Fig. 6(b), in which the values for \Delta C and \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} are 15.6 (mJ/mol K) and 0.55, respectively. These results indicate that the anomaly in C_{\rm el} observed here is due to the superconducting transition of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{3}. Notably, the value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} obtained here is quite small, less than half of the BCS value (1.43).

The theory of d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki[10] can be used to help explain the small value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} . They investigated theoretically the relationship between C_{s}/\gamma T_{c0} and T/T_{c0}, where C_{s} , \gamma, and T_{c0} are the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state, the Sommerfeld constant, and the superconducting transition temperature in the absence of impurities, respectively. Their result shows that the magnitudes of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} and T_{c} decrease remarkably with increasing impurities. The calculated value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} is very small (0.95) even for a clean d-wave superconductor compared to the BCS value (1.43) and decreases to 0.5 for samples containing impurities with \Gamma/\Delta_{00} = 0.2, where \Gamma is given by the ratio [\Gamma = n_{i}/\pi N(0)] of the impurity concentration n_{i} and the density of states at the Fermi energy per spin, N(0) , and \Delta_{00} is the energy gap at T = 0 K for a clean d-wave superconductor. Our small value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} ( = 0.55 - 0.60) just lies on impurity concentrations of between \Gamma/\Delta_{00}= 0.1 and 0.2. Since the Schottky anomaly observed in the specific heat suggests the existence of magnetic impurities in our sample, our experimental results are consistent with the theoretical ones for the impurity effects on d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki.[10]

To compare our experimental result on the temperature dependence of C_{\rm el}/\gamma T in the superconducting state with the theoretical behavior proposed by Sun and Maki, C_{\rm el}/\gamma T as a function of the normalized temperature T/T_{c} was recalculated for various impurity contents using the relationship between C_{s}/\gamma T_{c0} and T/T_{c0} shown by Sun and Maki (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 10). In Fig. 7, the calculated results are shown with our experimental result and show that the temperature depen

Figure 7: Normalized temperature dependence of the ratio of the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state and \gamma T for various concentrations of impurities. The solid lines represent the results calculated using the theory of Sun and Maki (Ref. 10). The values of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} are 0.95, 0.77, 0.57, and 0.34 for \Gamma/\Delta_{00}= 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. The electronic specific heat for the Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{3} superconducting sample (No. 121S) is shown as open circles.

  dence of C_{\rm d}/\gamma T becomes weak with increasing impurity concentration. Our result near T_{c} agrees with the calculated one between \Gamma/\Delta_{00}= 0.1 and 0.2, although it deviates from the theoretical results in the low-temperature region due to the influence of the Schottky anomaly. The temperature dependence of C_{\rm d}/\gamma T in the superconducting state is also consistent with the impurity effects for d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki,[10] in addition to the result of the jump in C_{\rm d} at T_{c} . Thus the jump in C_{\rm d} at T_{c} and the temperature dependence of C_{\rm d} near T_{c} as well as the temperature dependence of C_{\rm d} at T\llT_{c},[5, 6] which has been reported previously, argue for high-T_{c} cuprates being d-wave superconductors.

Next, we discuss the relationship between T_{c} , \gamma, and doped carrier content. According to the results obtained by Yamada _et al._,[14] as the carrier content increases from the underdoped region to the overdoped one, T_{c} increases initially and then decreases; it shows the typical curve of T_{c} versus carrier in high-T_{c} cuprates, while \gamma increases smoothly with increasing carrier (see Figs. 6 and 8 in Ref. [14]). In our case, as shown in Figs. 4 and 6, the value of \gamma of the superconducting sample is smaller than that of the nonsuperconducting sample. Since our superconducting sample in the overdoped region was produced by the reduction of carriers from the nonsuperconducting sample, \gamma increases with increasing doped carrier in contrast with the decrease in T_{c} . Thus we find that our result of the relationship between T_{c} , \gamma, and carrier content is in good agreement with that obtained by Yamada _et al.[14]_ Therefore, in the nonsuperconducting overdoped region of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} , \gamma increases with increasing carrier content. This is inconsistent with the result[5] in the nonsuperconducting overdoped region of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, in which \gamma decreases with increasing carrier content. This suggests that the relationship between \gamma and carrier content is not given universally, at least in the overdoped region of high-T_{c} cuprates.

Finally, it should be emphasized that the specific-heat anomaly obtained here is due to the superconducting transition from the normal state, but not from the pseudogap state. If the superconducting transition occurs in the underdoped region where the pseudogap state is formed well above T_{c} , the behavior of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} might be different from the behavior predicted by the Sun-Maki theory[10] which applies to a d-wave superconductor without the pseudogap. It is widely accepted that understanding the pseudogap is important in relation to the mechanism of high-T_{c} cuprates. However, at present, the specific-heat anomaly at the superconducting transition from the pseudogap state is not sufficiently clear. We believe that the present result will give us a starting point to investigate superconductivity from the pseudogap state. Current research is focusing on the specific-heat measurement of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} in the underdoped region.

## IV Conclusion

We have investigated the temperature dependence of the specific heat of superconducting and nonsuperconducting samples of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} in the overdoped region. The temperature dependence of the specific heat of the nonsuperconducting sample is accurately presented as C= \gamma T+ \beta T^{3} + \beta T^{5}+ A/T^{2}, while in the superconducting sample, a specific-heat anomaly is observed at T_{c} , in addition to the temperature dependence of C seen for the nonsuperconducting sample. The magnitude of the specific-heat anomaly at T_{c} , \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} , is 0.55-0.60, which is less than half of the BCS value. The electronic specific heat in the superconducting state near T_{c} shows a weak temperature dependence compared with BCS behavior. The quite small value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} and the weak temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state are consistent with the effects of impurities predicted by the model of d-wave superconductors proposed by Sun and Maki. These findings demonstrate that superconducting Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} in the overdoped region is a d-wave superconductor.

The value of \gamma for the superconducting sample was smaller than that for the nonsuperconducting sample; that is, \gamma increased with increasing doped carrier, because the superconducting sample was prepared by the reduction of carrier content from the nonsuperconducting sample. The relationship between T_{c} , \gamma, and carrier concentration in the overdoped region of Bi_{1.8}Pb_{0.3}Sr_{1.9}CuO_{y} shows behavior that contrasts with the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system. This suggests that the relationship between T_{c} and carrier content is similar for many high-T_{c} cuprates, but that between \gamma and carrier content is not.
