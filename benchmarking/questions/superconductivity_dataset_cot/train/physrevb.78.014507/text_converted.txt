## I Introduction

The recent discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO near 25 K,¹
along with the ability to essentially double T_(c) either by application
of hydrostatic pressure² or by substitution of rare earths,³ has given
rise to a new sense of optimism within the high-temperature
superconductivity community. First of all, these materials break the
tyranny of copper, offering high transition temperatures without
requiring the presence of copper oxide. Second it is not at all clear
(experimentally) what the mechanism for superconductivity in these
materials is, although there are a multitude of exotic and intriguing
theoretical predictions. Unfortunately, the growth of single crystals of
these compounds, specifically the superconducting variants, has proven
to be difficult. Single grains as large as 300 μm have been
characterized as part of polycrystalline pellets (synthesized at 3.3
GPa),⁴ and freestanding crystallites ∼100 μm across have been grown out
of high-temperature salt solutions (again at high pressures).⁵

A second key finding has been the even more recent discovery of
superconductivity below T_(c)=38 K in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂.⁶ Whereas
BaFe₂As₂, like LaFeAsO, is a tetragonal compound with a Fe plane capped
above and below by As,⁷ it does not contain oxygen. This means that
superconductivity in the Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ system not only breaks
the tyranny of copper, it also implies that the superconductivity of
these FeAs-based compounds is not intimately associated with oxide
physics. In addition to this conceptual simplification, there is a
profound experimental simplification as well: BaFe₂As₂ is an
intermetallic compound and can be grown in single-crystal form utilizing
conventional growth from a metal solvent or flux. In this paper we
present crystallographic, as well as anisotropic thermodynamic and
transport data on single crystals of the nonsuperconducting parent
compound BaFe₂As₂ as well as on superconducting Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂.

## II Experimental Methods

Single crystals of BaFe₂As₂ and Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ were grown out
of a Sn flux using conventional high-temperature solution growth
techniques.⁸ Elemental Ba, K, Fe, and As were added to Sn in the ratio
of [(Ba/K)Fe₂As₂]:Sn=1⋅48 and placed in an ∼2 ml MgO crucible. A second,
catch, crucible containing silica wool was placed on top of the growth
crucible and both were sealed in a silica ampoule under approximately
1/3 atmosphere of argon gas. It should be noted that the packing and
assembly of the growth ampoule was performed in a glovebox with a
nitrogen atmosphere. The sealed ampoule was placed in a programmable
furnace and heated to either 1000 or 850 ^(∘)C and cooled over 36 h to
500 ^(∘)C. Once the furnace reached 500 ^(∘)C the Sn was decanted from
the Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ crystals. Whereas the BaFe₂As₂ growth was
cooled from 1000 ^(∘)C, when the potassium-doped growths were taken to
1000 ^(∘)C there was a clear attack on the silica wool as well as on the
silica tube and a greatly reduced amount of K in the resulting crystals.
In order to avoid this loss of K, x>0 growths of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂
were only heated to 850 ^(∘)C. Even with this precaution in place, we
found it necessary to use excess K in the growth to compensate for
losses due to the combination of potassium vapor pressure and
reactivity. The Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ growth used an initial
stoichiometry of Ba_(0.6)K_(0.8)Fe₂As₂.

Figure 1 shows a picture of a single crystal of Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂
against a millimeter scale. Typical crystals

have dimensions of 1 - 2 x 1 - 2 x 0.05 - 0.1 mm³. Some crystals
manifest linear dimensions as large as 3-4 mm. The crystallographic c
axis is perpendicular to the plane of the platelike single crystals. All
of the crystals grown so far have been rather thin and are prone to
exfoliation.

Powder x-ray diffraction data was collected on a Rigaku Miniflex
diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation at room temperature.
Room-temperature single-crystal diffraction was performed on a Bruker
SMART CCD four circle diffractometer and analyzed by standard methods
using the shellxtl 6.1 software package. Temperature-dependent
single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a
standard four-circle diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation from a
rotating anode x-ray source, selected by a germanium (111)
monochromator. For the measurements, a platelike single crystal with
dimensions of 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.2 mm³ was selected and attached to a flat
copper sample holder on the cold finger of a closed-cycle display
refrigerator. The diffraction patterns were recorded while the
temperature was varied between 10 K and 300 K. The mosaicity of the
investigated BaFe₂As₂ single crystal was 0.04^(∘) FWHM in the rocking
curve of the (0 0 10) reflection. Elemental analysis of the samples was
performed using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in the
electron probe microanalyzer of a JEOL JXA-8200 Superprobe.

Magnetic-field- and temperature-dependent magnetization data were
collected using a Quantum Design (QD) Magnetic Properties Measurement
System and temperature-dependent specific heat as well as magnetic field
and temperature-dependent electrical transport data were collected using
a QD Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS). Electrical contact
was made to the samples using Epotek H20E silver epoxy to attach Pt
wires in a four-probe configuration. (It is worth noting that curing of
the epoxy at 120 ^(∘)C for up to 30 min does not seem to degrade the
samples.) Basal plane resistivity values were determined by estimating
the length and cross sections of the samples assuming that current
density was uniformly distributed throughout the cross section. Given
the layered nature and the thinness of the crystals, we believe that the
resistivity values should be accurate to better than ±50

## III Results

Given that the stoichiometry of these materials appears to play a key
role in their physics, elemental analysis was performed on both the
nominally pure BaFe₂As₂ sample as well as on the _K_-doped sample. WDS
measurements on the pure sample gave a Ba:Fe:As ratio of 1:2:2 with
approximately 1

The K content of the doped sample was also determined via WDS analysis.
Figure 2 shows an image of the sample measured as well as the location
of the spots tested. Table 1 presents the atomic percents of each
element estimated from the weight percents determined from the analysis.
As can be seen the sample was neither polished nor cleaved. Instead,
different terraces on the as grown surface were measured. This terracing
is a clear example of the layering so common to these crystals: each of
the visible layers can be easily cleaved or exfoliated from the rest of
the sample. The data in Table 1 are consistent with a 1:2:2 ratio of
(Ba+K):Fe:As.

plane of the plate. Droplets of Sn flux can be seen on the surface.

Elemental analysis was performed via WDS at each of the points marked by
a star. The average K substitution value was found to be 0.44 with a
0.07 standard deviation.

These data are also consistent with an ∼0.66

Powder x-ray diffraction patterns were taken on ground single crystals
from each batch. The data are shown in Fig. 3. For BaFe2As2, the lattice
parameters were found to be a =3.9436 A and c=13.115 A. Room-temperature
single-crystal diffraction data taken on a crystal of BaFe2As2 gave
similar results: a=3.9467 A and c=13.113 A. Whereas the a-lattice
parameter is similar to that already reported,7 the c-lattice parameter
is slightly but significantly larger. This may be associated with the
incorporation of Sn into the bulk, as discussed above. Unfortunately,
the current crystals did not allow for the collection of enough
reflections to allow for a refinement of such a small possible Sn
occupancy. The lattice parameters inferred for Ba0.55K0.45Fe2As2 from
the powder x-ray diffraction data were a=3.9186 A and c = 13.256 A,
comparable to the values found for the 40

$K\  of the 140 K transition reported for the polycrystalline samples of BaFe\({}_{2}$As₂.[7]
Given that these single crystals have been grown out of excess Sn,
appear to have a small, but detectable amount of Sn incorporated into
their bulk, and show a slightly expanded c axis, it is plausible that
the changes that we have found are another manifestation of the fact
that this transition is very sensitive to small changes in
stoichiometry, band filling, and lattice parameter. This being said, a
valid question is, what is the nature of the 85 K transition in these
crystals and is it similar to the structural phase transition that has
already been found for in polycrystalline samples?

To address this question, Figs. 7 and 8 summarize the
temperature-dependent single-crystal x-ray diffraction data collected on
BaFe₂As₂. Figure 7 shows the splitting of the (1 10) reflection as the
sample is cooled through _T_ 85 K. Whereas there is splitting in the (1
1 10) reflection in (_x_(60) scans below 85 K, there is no change in the
shape of the (0 0 10) reflection between 10 and 160 K. This is
consistent with the reported tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase
transition, from space group I4/_mmm_ to _Fmmm_, with a distortion along
the (110) direction. Figure 8 plots the temperature dependence of the
lattice parameters between 10 and 100 K. In addition to the splitting of
the tetragonal _a_-lattice parameter below 85 K, the _c_-lattice
parameter and the unit-cell volume change their temperature dependencies
below 85 K as well, becoming essentially temperature independent at
lower temperatures. The relative splitting of the lattice parameter in
the orthorhombic phase is approximately 70

Although the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic splitting is very clear when
comparing the 10 and 100 K scans (Fig. 7) in the intermediate
temperature range (85-60 K) reflections related to the orthorhombic
phase appear to coexist with reflections related to the tetragonal
phase. This could imply a first-order nature to this transition, but a
more trivial explanation could be that the x-ray beam illuminated parts
of the sample with slightly different transition temperatures.

BaFe₂As₂. Upper inset: C_(p)/T as a function of _T_² for low-temperature
data; lower inset: expanded view near the _T_ 85 K phase transition.

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity data for two separate
single crystals from the same batch of Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ are
presented in Fig. 9. Both crystals have T> 100 K resistivities that are
very similar in size and temperature dependence to that found in Fig. 4
for BaFe₂As₂. Both crystals also manifest superconductivity below ∼30 K.
Crystal A shows a break in slope near the 85 K transition temperature
found in BaFe₂As₂, whereas crystal B displays a featureless decrease in
resistivity down to the onset of superconductivity. Crystal A has a
multiple step transition with a higher onset temperature and a lower
zero resistance temperature. Crystal B has a sharp superconducting
transition that, as will be shown below, does not significantly broaden
in applied magnetic fields of up to 140 kOe. These results are
consistent with the evaluation of the amount of K in the sample shown in
Fig. 2; there can be a somewhat differing amount of K in different
layers or different crystals of these compounds.

Figure 10 presents the anisotropic M/H data for Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂.
The data for both directions of applied field are essentially
featureless down to T_(c)∼ 30 K. Below

(1 1 10) reflection and from the (0 0 10) reflection (not shown). The
open squares in the lower panel represent the lattice parameter
corresponding to the central reflection which coexists with the pair of
reflections related to the orthorhombic phase (seen clearly in the 70 K
data set in Fig. 7). For clarity, the a-lattice parameter in the
high-temperature tetragonal phase has been multiplied by a factor of
$\sqrt{2}$ so as to allow for comparison to the low-temperature
orthorhombic phase data. The middle panel presents the temperature
dependence of the c-lattice parameter and the upper panel presents the
calculated unit-cell volume. The error bars represent the relative
precision; the absolute error is method-related and significantly
larger.

position of the tetragonal (1 1 10) reflection for selected
temperatures. The lines represent the fitted curves to obtain the
reflection positions for the data shown in Fig. 8. The offset between
each data set is 100 counts/s.

_T_ = 30 K the data become strongly diamagnetic and will be discussed
below. For comparison, the anisotropic _M_/_H_ data presented in Fig. 5
for BaFe₂As₂ are shown as dashed lines. For T > 90 K the BaFe₂As₂ and
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ data are essentially identical, down to their
slight high-temperature anisotropy. The primary differences between the
BaFe₂As₂ and Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ data sets are: (i) the effect of
the 85 K phase transition in BaFe₂As₂ which causes the _H_ ∥ c data to
break away from the corresponding data for Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ and
(ii) the advent of superconductivity for T < 30 K.

The low-field _M_/_H_ data for Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ are shown in Fig.
11 for magnetic field applied along the c axis (perpendicular to the
thin platelike sample) and perpendicular to the c axis (along the
surface of the thin platelike sample). The temperature dependence of the
field-cooled-warming and zero-field-cooled-warming data for the two
field orientations is similar and an estimate of the superconducting
fraction from the ZFC data for the field along the surface of the plate
(the low demagnetization factor direction) is ∼ 50

The temperature-dependent specific-heat data for Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂
are presented in Fig. 12. The data for BaFe₂As₂ (Fig. 6) are shown for
comparison as a dotted line. The broad feature associated with the 85 K
structural transition in BaFe₂As₂ is reduced, although there appears to
be some remnant of it in the Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ data. The
low-temperature specific-heat data from Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ (upper

zero.

inset) can be fitted to the C_(p)= γT+ βT³ power law for 100 K2 >T²>20
K2 with γ=23 mJ/mol K2 and β =0.83 mJ/mol K4 from which a Θ_(D) value of
230 K can be inferred. The small structure near T²∼ 16 K may well be
associated with some residual Sn flux on the sample. Regardless of this,
it is worth noting that the linear, or electronic, specific-heat term is
clearly not going to zero as temperature approaches 0 K. Indeed the
estimated low-temperature electronic specific heat is about half that of
the undoped BaFe₂As₂ shown in Fig. 6.

The lower inset of Fig. 12 displays an expanded scale for T∼T_(c). The
data for T>30 K and the data for T<24 K are extended past T_(c) so as to
emphasize the slight, but detectable "jump" in specific heat of 0.7
J/mol K associated with the onset of superconductivity. In order to
estimate the ratio ΔC_(p^(′))γT_(c) the electronic specific heat in the
normal state of Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ is needed. Unfortunately, as
will be shown below, superconductivity is not suppressed significantly
by an applied magnetic field of 140 kOe. Using the low-temperature gamma
values for BaFe₂As₂ and Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ as well as T_(c)∼ 30 K
the ratio of ΔC_(p^(′))γT_(c) is found to be 0.63 and 1.01,
respectively. We can treat these data in an extreme limit by assuming
that about half of the sample (layers) was not superconducting. This
would explain the finite γ at low temperatures and would increase the
ΔC_(p^(′))γT_(c) value of ∼0.63 to a value of ∼1.2. Further measurements
will be needed to refine this value more fully. To within the accuracy
or our current measurements and estimates it is reasonable to evaluate
ΔC_(p^(′))γT_(c)∼ 1.

The anisotropy of the field dependence of the electrical resistivity and
suppression of superconductivity in Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ (crystal B)
are shown in Fig. 13. The normal-state resistivity is insensitive to
applied fields as large as 140 kOe and the applied field suppresses the
superconducting transition without any significant broadening of the
transition. Using an "onset" criterion for the determination of
T_(c)(H), H_(c2)(T) curves were determined for both directions of
applied field (Fig. 14). Similar suppressions and anisotropy were found
for crystal A.

The ratio of the H_(c2) values for the two characteristic directions can
be defined as γ=H_(c2)^( ⊥ c)/H_(c2)^( ∥ c) and is plotted in the inset
to Fig. 14. γ varies between 3.5 and 2.5 in the very limited range below
T_(c) we are able to measure (being limited by a 140 kOe maximum applied
field and the extremely high slope of H_(c2)^( ⊥ c)).

## IV Analysis and Discussion

Growth of single crystals of BaFe₂As₂ and Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ out of
excess Sn flux provides direct access to single crystals of the recently
discovered[6] family of intermetallic iron-arsenide superconductors.
Although the single crystals of BaFe₂As₂ manifest a transition near ∼85
K rather than the 140 K reported for polycrystalline samples,[7]
single-crystal diffraction data indicate that the transition is the same
type of tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition.

The changes in the resistivity as well as the Hall resistivity of the
BaFe₂As₂ crystals upon cooling through 85 K (Fig. 4) suggest a decrease
in the density of states at the Fermi surface associated with the
structural phase transition to the lower-temperature orthorhombic phase.
It is not immediately clear why our basal plane resistivity manifests an
approximately 50

The magnetic susceptibility of BaFe₂As₂ as well as
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ can be analyzed in terms of a Curie-Weiss law
with an additional temperature-independent term to account for the sum
of core diamagnetism, Pauli paramagnetism, and Landau diamagnetism:
χ=C/(T − θ)+χ₀. Figure 15 shows the temperature-dependent M/H data for
BaFe₂As₂ for H⊥c. The high- and low-temperature parts (above and below
T∼ 85 K) of this curve can be well fit by a Curie-Weiss form with
similar values of both χ₀ and $\mu_{\rm eff}$. The primary effect of the
structural phase transition appears to be

Figure 13: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity of Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ near T_(c) in constant applied
magnetic fields of up to 140 kOe for H⊥c (upper panel) and H∥c (lower
panel). Data (from higher transition temperature to lower) are for
applied magnetic fields of 0, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 140 kOe,
respectively. The lines drawn on the 140 kOe data in the lower panel
illustrate the onset criterion that has been used to determine T_(c) for
each field.

to cause a change in the sign of the paramagnetic θ from +20 K in the
high-temperature region to −5 K in the low-temperature region. This
could be consistent with a change in the nature of the in-plane magnetic
interactions; microscopic measurements will be needed to shed further
light on this. Given the similarity between the high-temperature M/H
data for BaFe₂As₂ and Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ shown in Fig. 10, it is
not surprising that the Curie-Weiss fit to the Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂
data is similar to that for the BaFe₂As₂. Within the accuracy of these
fits (given their limited temperature range) these data are consistent
with ∼1.2 μ_(B)/f.t. for all temperature ranges and compositions.

The H_(c2)(T) data shown in Fig. 14 clearly indicate that
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ will have a substantial H_(c2)(0) value.
Depending on the model or extrapolation chosen, H_(c2)(0) for H∥c can be
expected to be anywhere between 750 and 1100 kOe. This lower value only
slightly exceeds the Clogston paramagnetic limit.[9] If the anisotropy
seen close to T_(c) (Fig. 14) remains unchanged, H_(c2)(0) for H⊥c will
be even larger. These are very long extrapolations and these values only
serve to indicate that Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ will be a very high-field
superconductor.

## V Summary

Anisotropic thermodynamic and transport measurements, as well as
crystallographic measurements, have been performed on sizable single
crystals of BaFe₂As₂ and Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ grown out of Sn flux.
The crystals of both composition have small but detectable (∼1.0

The superconducting transition in Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ can be clearly
detected in electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements and
can also be observed in the specific-heat data. Based on the anomaly in
C_(p)(T) we can estimate ΔC_(p)/γT_(c)∼ 1. The upper superconducting
critical field is clearly anisotropic with γ=H_(c2)^( ⊥ ⊥)/H_(c2)^( ∥ c)
varying between 3.5 and 2.5 for the first two degrees below T_(c).
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂ will clearly have an exceptionally high
H_(c2)(0) with estimates of 750 kOe or higher being easily justifiable.
