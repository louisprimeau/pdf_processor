15 April A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer was used to study magnetic properties from 2.5 up to 300 K in fields up to 6 T using polycrystalline specimens of about 20 mg. Specific heat measurements on about 1 g of polycrystalline Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} were performed at temperatures ranging from 2.5 up to 100 K by means of an adiabatic step heating method. Additionally, specific heat measurements in the temperature range between 350 mK and 20 K were carried on La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} and Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} samples with a commercial Quantum Design PPMS ^{3}He relaxation calorimeter in fields up to 1 T. Electrical resistivity measurements were carried out in a ^{3}He bath top-loading cryostat with a maximum magnetic field of 12.5 T and for temperatures from 350 mK up to 300 K. Resistivity was measured with the electrical current flowing parallel to the applied magnetic field via a four-probe technique using an ac bridge (Lakeshore 370).

## III Results and Discussion

The XRD analyses indicate that RE_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} phases with La and Ce as rare earth elements are present as a major phase with a minor amount of impurity phases. The XRD pattern of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} together with the corresponding Rietveld refinement are shown in Fig. 1, revealing a=0.42358(1) nm, b=0.42900(1) nm, and c=2.45400(7) nm. Some small extra XRD peaks could be indexed on the basis of a La_{2}Pd_{3}Si_{3} phase. The content of impurities is estimated to be a few percent in each sample. In the case of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} these small impurity phases were identified as Ce_{2}Pd_{3}Si_{3} (Ce_{2}Rh_{1.35}Ge_{4.65} type) and CeOPd_{2}Si_{2} (ThCr_{2}Si_{2} type) in agreement with the Ce-Pd-Si phase diagram [3], where these two phases were reported as neighboring phases.

### La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}

Both resistivity and heat capacity measurements carried out on La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} evidence bulk superconductivity below 2 K. Shown in Fig. 2 is the temperature dependent electrical resistivity \rho of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} at zero field (main panel) and at various externally applied magnetic fields. Clearly visible is a superconducting transition being located slightly above 2 K. This transition temperature is in good coincidence with data reported in Refs. [6] and [7] derived from measurements of the electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility. Metallic behavior and the importance of _s-d_ scattering in La_{3}Pd_{3}Si_{4} is quantitatively revealed from the applicability of the Bloch-Wilson model [18], i.e.,

\[\rho(T) = A\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{D}}\right)^{5}\int_{0}^{\theta_{D}/T} \frac{z^{5}dz}{[\exp(z)-1][1-\exp(-z)]}\] \[\quad+B\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{D}}\right)^{3}\int_{\theta_{\rm min }/T}^{\theta_{D}/T}\frac{z^{3}dz}{[\exp(z)-1][1-\exp(-z)]}-\kappa\,T^{3}.\]

The Mott-Jones term \kappa\,T^{3} accounts for scattering of conduction electrons on a narrow d band (e.g., Pd-4d or La-5d in La_{3}Pd_{3}Si_{4}) near to the Fermi energy [19] and explains the negative curvature in \rho(T) at higher temperatures. A least-squares fit of this model to the experimental data (solid line, Fig. 2) reveals a Debye temperature \theta_{D}=155 K, and \kappa\approx 10^{-7}\mu\Omega cm K^{-3} as well as a minimum phonon energy k_{B}\theta_{\rm min}=\hbar\omega_{\rm min}, with \theta_{\rm min}=98 K. Here \omega_{\rm min} is the frequency corresponding to the minimum \vec{q} value to excite the _s-d_ transitions [18]. A=54\mu\Omega cm and B=8.6\mu\Omega cm are material dependent constants (compare Fig. 5, too).

The superconducting phase transition is relatively sharp, evidencing good sample quality. The application of magnetic fields (inset, Fig. 2) consecutively suppresses superconductivity, and magnetic fields of the order of 1 T are sufficient to entirely eliminate the superconducting state. This suppression is accompanied by a slight increase of the width of the phase transition. The Debye temperature as derived from resistivity data is significantly lower than that derived from our specific heat measurements (see below). This might be a result of

To proof whether superconductivity in La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is of bulk nature and does not refer to an impurity phase, heat capacity measurements C_{p}(T) have been carried out for temperatures down to 350 mK and for magnetic fields up to 0.4 T. Results are displayed in Fig. 3. Bulk superconductivity is obvious from the distinct anomaly of C_{p}/T around 2 K. An accurate determination of the superconducting transition temperature can be made from an idealized jump of the heat capacity anomaly (solid line, Fig. 3) by a balance of entropy, yielding T_{c}=1.98 K, in good agreement with the resistivity data. The ideal peak height of the SC anomaly would then be 27 mJ/mol K^{2}.

An estimation of the normal state Sommerfeld value \gamma_{n} within the temperature range between 2 and 5 K, reveals 26 mJ/mol K^{2}, and, additionally, \theta_{D}=280 K. A similar \gamma value is obtained if field measurements (e.g., \mu_{0}H=0.4 T) are considered, resulting in \gamma_{n}=28 mJ/mol K^{2}. The latter, however, is derived within a much smaller range of extrapolation.

From the jump of the specific heat \Delta C_{p}/T(T=T_{c})\approx 27 mJ/mol K^{2}, we calculate the parameter \Delta C_{p}/(\gamma_{n}T_{c})\approx 1.03, which is below the figure expected from BCS theory, \Delta C_{p}/(\gamma\,T_{c})\approx 1.43.

Deviations from a standard BCS behavior are also evident from the temperature dependent specific heat. Compared in Fig. 4(a) are the experimental heat capacity data of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} plotted in a normalized representation C_{p}/(\gamma_{n}T_{c}), together with the heat capacity of a fully gapped s-wave superconductor as tabulated by Muhlschlegel[20] [solid line, Fig. 4(a)] and a simple power law C_{p}\propto T^{3} [dashed-double-dotted line, Fig. 4(a)]. The latter would indicate point nodes in the superconducting gap. Obviously both models do not properly account for the experimental data, specifically in the low temperature range.

A further model calculation is based on a two gap scenario employing the so-called \alpha model developed by Padamsee _et al.[21]_ with only one adjustable parameter \alpha=\Delta(0)/(k_{B}T_{c}). Note, the value \alpha=1.764 corresponds to the weak coupling BCS limit. The heat capacity in the superconducting state is then a sum of individual contributions of both gaps \Delta_{i}(0), together with the ratio \gamma_{1}/\gamma_{2}, with the partial specific heat contributions \gamma_{1}+\gamma_{2}=\gamma_{n}. Such calculations have been successfully applied to MgB_{2},[22] to borocarbide superconductors,[23] or recently to the ternary iron-silicide Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5}.[24] Employing this model to La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} with \alpha_{1}=1.95, \alpha_{2}=1.1, and \gamma_{1}/\gamma_{2}=0.7/0.3 [dashed line, Fig. 4(a)] reveals convincing agreement with the experimental data in an extended temperature range. Such a two gap model would also be in line with the pronounced positive curvature found for the upper critical field of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} (see below). The temperature dependent difference between the experimental data and the three theoretical models are shown in Fig. 4(b), clearly demonstrating the superior agreement of the two gap scenario over a fully gapped s-wave model or the simple power law.

As shown in Fig. 3, both the transition temperature and the jump of the specific heat at T_{c} become suppressed with increasing externally applied magnetic fields. This field dependent lowering of T_{c} is outlined in Fig. 4(b), where both resistivity and heat capacity data are summarized. As it is obvious from this figure, T_{c}(\mu_{0}H) shows a superlinear dependence, reaching an upper critical field at zero temperature \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) of about 0.6 T. A typical BCS superconductor, however, would exhibit a sublinear temperature dependence \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T). In absence of low temperature measurements, Fujii[7, 6] estimated an upper

The solid line is the heat capacity of a fully gapped BCS superconductor, whereas the dashed line represents a model with two different superconducting gaps. For details see the text. The dashedâ€“double-dotted line is a power law C_{p}\propto T^{3}. (b) Temperature dependent difference \delta of experimental and theoretical heat capacity data C_{p}/(\gamma_{n}T_{c}) below T_{c}.

(c) Upper critical magnetic field \mu_{0}H_{c2} of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} as derived from resistivity (50% criterion) and specific heat data (thermodynamic mean value of the transition). The dashed line is a least-squares fit employing Eq. (1) and the solid line is a fit based on the WHH model (see text). The dashed-dotted line is the thermodynamic critical field.

  critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2}\approx 0.33 T from a simple extrapolation of susceptibility results.

The unusual temperature dependence of the upper critical field of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} can have different microscopic origins: (i) The existence of more than one Fermi-surface sheet with energy gaps of different magnitudes as reported, e.g., for binary MgB_{2}, or (ii) strong anisotropies of the superconducting order parameter residing on a single Fermi-surface sheet.

Positive curvatures of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) have been observed, e.g., for the nonmagnetic rare-earth nickel borocarbides RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R = Y, Lu) and were explained theoretically employing effective two-band models.[25, 26] Phenomenologically, \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) of borocarbides and MgB_{2} were accounted for in a wide temperature range using the simple expression[27]

\[\mu_{0}H_{c2}=\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(1-T/T_{c})^{1+\beta},\] (2)

where \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*} and \beta are fitting parameters. Similar to the borocarbide case and MgB_{2}, \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}, as displayed in Fig. 4(c), can be described on the basis of Eq. (2). A least-squares fit is shown in Fig. 4(c) as a dashed line revealing H_{c2}^{*}=0.6 and \beta=0.77. Exponents of a similar order were derived for borocarbides and MgB_{2}, too.

Werthamer _et al.[28]_ derived an expression (abbreviated as _WHH model_) for the upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2} in terms of orbital pair breaking, including the effect of Pauli spin paramagnetism and spin-orbit scattering. The WHH model is ruled by two parameters, namely \alpha_{M}, the Pauli paramagnetic limitation (= Maki parameter[29]), and \lambda_{\infty}, describing spin-orbit scattering. While the value of \alpha_{M} allows a rough discrimination between orbital pair breaking and Pauli limiting, \lambda_{\infty} becomes non-negligible for heavier atoms.

The Maki parameter \alpha_{M} can be estimated[28] from the Sommerfeld value \gamma and the residual resistivity \rho_{0} as \alpha_{M}=0.23. The reasonably low value of \alpha indicates that orbital pair breaking in La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is the essential mechanism, limiting the upper critical field. The overall temperature dependence of \mu_{0}H_{c2} as derived from the WHH model is displayed as a solid line in Fig. 4(b), revealing \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=0.21 T, which is more than two times smaller than the experimentally observed data.

The thermodynamic critical field is calculated from the free energy difference between the superconducting and normal state, given by the expression \Delta F(T)=F_{n}-F_{t}=\mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}(T)/2=\int_{T_{c}}^{T}\int_{T_{c}}^{T} \frac{(C-C_{n})}{T}dT^{\prime\prime}dT^{\prime}. The quantity C_{n}(T) is obtained from the zero field specific heat measurement, whereas C_{n}(T) is obtained from the data corresponding to the 0.4 T run. The values derived are displayed in Fig. 4(b) as a dashed-dotted line; an extrapolation to T\to 0 yields \mu_{0}H_{c}(0)\approx 0.04 T. This allows us to evaluate a value for the dimensionless Ginzburg Landau parameter \kappa_{\rm GL}=H_{c2}(0)/(\sqrt{2}H_{c})\simeq 9.8, where the experimentally determined H_{c2}(0)=0.55 T has been used. The coherence length \xi_{0} for T\to 0 can be obtained from \mu_{0}H_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\,\xi_{0}^{2}), yielding \xi_{0}\simeq 2.44\times 10^{-8} m. Combining the Ginzburg Landau parameter with the coherence length, the London penetration depth can be obtained as \lambda_{L}(T\to 0)\simeq 2.39\times 10^{-7} m.

An estimation of the electron-phonon interaction strength \lambda_{v,\rm ph} is possible in terms of the McMillan formula.[30] Applying this model, and taking the repulsive screened Coulomb part \mu^{*}\approx 0.13, yields \lambda_{v,\rm ph}\approx 0.52; this characterizes La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} as a SC in the weak coupling limit.

Similarly, an electron-phonon enhancement factor of about the same magnitude can be found if recent electronic structure calculations are considered,[31] where the calculated density of states at the Fermi energy corresponds to a bare band value \gamma_{b}=19.8 mJ/mol K^{2}. A comparison with the experimentally derived Sommerfeld value \gamma=29 mJ/mol K^{2} yields \lambda_{v,\rm ph}\approx 0.46, supporting the weak coupling regime.

Based on the value of l_{\rm tr}/\xi\approx 0.75 we classify La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} as a weakly coupled superconductor in the dirty limit; the value of \kappa_{\rm GL}\approx 10 refers to a type II superconductor.

### Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}

Intermetallic compounds based on Ce are known a long time for a variety of interesting ground states, primarily triggered by the Kondo effect as a result of distinct interactions between conduction electrons and the magnetic moment of the Ce ion. In the following, results derived from resistivity, heat capacity, and magnetization measurements will be used to obtain information on the ground state properties of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}.

Shown in Fig. 5 are temperature dependent resistivity measurements of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} and of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}; the latter compound serves as a nonmagnetic reference, representing the contribution to the electrical resistivity owing to the electron-phonon interaction. While \rho(T) of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} exhibits superconductivity below 2 K and a simple metallic behavior in the normal state region (see the previous section), \rho(T) of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} shows a much more complex temperature dependence as typical for Kondo lattice systems. The most dominant feature is a maximum in \rho(T) around 8.5 K with \rho(T) dropping above and below this temperature. Well above 100 K, a local minimum develops in \rho(T). A comparison of the experimental data of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} and La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} allows

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature dependent resistivity \rho of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} and Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} plotted on a logarithmic temperature scale. The magnetic contribution \rho_{\rm mag}(T) of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is also shown in this plot, where the dashed line should emphasize Kondo interaction; \rho_{\rm mag}\approx\rho(\rm Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4})-\rho(\rm La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}). The solid line is a least-squares fit as explained in Fig. 2.

  us to derive the magnetic part \rho_{\rm mag} if one assumes that the phonon contribution of both compounds is equal. \rho_{\rm mag}(T) of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is included in Fig. 5, too. The logarithmic temperature dependence of \rho_{\rm mag} at elevated temperatures evidences Kondo interaction in the presence of crystalline electric field splitting. The drop of \rho(T) at low temperatures results from the development of a coherent state owing to the Kondo lattice properties of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}. In general, such a coherent state would be concomitant with Fermi-liquid features, and a T^{2} behavior of \rho_{\rm mag}(T) should become obvious. The present experimental data, however, reveal a distinctly different power law.

A closer inspection of the low temperature resistivity data is shown in Fig. 6, where measurements at various magnetic fields are added. The low temperature maximum in \rho(T) is weakly field dependent and shifts from about 8.5 K at zero magnetic field to about 10.5 K at an externally applied field of 8 T. Such a field dependence of the electrical resistivity is typical for cerium and ytterbium based Kondo lattices. At the lowest temperatures of our study, Fermi-liquid features are absent in \rho(T). Rather, the zero field measurement can be accounted for by a simple power law \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}, where the exponent n=1 reveals best agreement; in the case of the 12 T run, n=1.15. These exponents are indicative of a non-Fermi-liquid behavior, arising, most likely, from the proximity of a magnetic instability of the Ce ions.

A magnetic state of the Ce ions in Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}, can be concluded from magnetic susceptibility measurements \chi(T) as shown in Fig. 7. Applying a modified Curie-Weiss law to the experimental data, i.e.,

\[\chi=\chi_{0}+\frac{C}{T-\theta_{p}},\] (3)

yields information concerning a temperature independent Pauli contribution \chi_{0}, the effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} (deduced from the Curie constant C), and the paramagnetic Curie temperature \theta_{p}. Results of a least-squares fit (T>50 K) according to Eq. (3) are shown as a solid line in Fig. 7, revealing an effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff}=2.51\mu_{B} close to that of the Ce-4f^{1} electronic configuration [\mu_{\rm eff}({\rm Ce^{3+}})=2.54\mu_{\rm B}] and a paramagnetic Curie temperature \theta_{p}=-29 K. The latter refers to antiferromagnetic interactions among the Ce ions. \chi(T) at low temperatures does not show any characteristic anomaly being typical for long range magnetic order. This is in line with isothermal magnetization data taken at T=2 K (inset, Fig. 7). A smooth, slightly curvilinear M(H) dependence is observed with relatively small magnetization values at 6 T. A description of these data can be done calculating the field dependent magnetization of an effective spin 1/2 system at T=2 K, employing a Lande factor g_{\rm eff}=0.775. Fairly good agreement is obtained in this way, except for the low field range, where the disagreement between the model and the experimental data appears to be in line with the Curie-like bending of the magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures. CEF effects are the primary cause for the appearance of only small magnetization values, well below g_{j}j=2.14\mu_{B}, associated with the total angular momentum of the free Ce^{3+} ion. A comparison with magnetization data of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Ge_{4} at T=2 K [35] shows for the latter a clear indication for a metamagnetic phase transition around 4 T, thus referring to an antiferromagnetic ground state.

To further prove the ground state of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}, heat capacity measurements C_{p} have been performed down to 400 mK. Results are displayed in Fig. 8 as C_{p}/T vs T, together with those of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}. The most prominent feature is an almost logarithmic contribution in the range of a few Kelvin, followed by a smooth saturation of C_{p}/T towards zero with very large values of about 2.7 J/mol K^{2}, corresponding to \gamma=0.9 J/mol K^{2} per cerium ion. Considering renormalization group calculations by Oliveira and Wilkins,[32] the Kondo temperature T_{K} follows from T_{K}=0.68\cdot R/\gamma=6.2 K if a doublet is considered as ground state.

Figure 7: (Color online) Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility \chi of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} plotted as 1/\chi vs T. The solid line is a fit employing a modified Curie-Weiss law. The inset displays the isothermal magnetization (T=2 K) of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}; the solid line is the magnetization of an effective spin 1/2 system with a Lande factor g_{\rm eff}=0.775.

  Assuming that the phonon contribution to the heat capacity of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} can be represented by the specific heat of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}, the magnetic entropy S_{\rm mag} can be derived by integrating C_{\rm mag}/\,T. Results of this evaluation are plotted in Fig. 8 as a dashed line, referring to the right axis. An entropy of 3\cdot R\ln 2 is reached around 18 K. The slow rate of the recovery of magnetic entropy in Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is a consequence of the Kondo effect present in this compound. S_{\rm mag}(T) also allows us to estimate the Kondo temperature independently from T_{K}=T(S_{\rm mag}\approx 0.45\cdot R\ln 2)\approx 4.4 K [33], in very good agreement with the estimation obtained from the Sommerfeld value. Kondo-type interaction is also supposed to be responsible for the suppression of long range magnetic order, absent in Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} at least down to 400 mK.

The further increase of S_{\rm mag} at higher temperatures indicates that the excited crystalline electric field levels are not well separated from the ground state; hence some hybridization between CEF levels might appear. This is seen from some deformation of the maximum of the magnetic contribution to the electrical resistivity, too.

In order to test whether or not Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is at or near the quantum critical point, the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) model of Moriya and Takimoto [14] can be taken into account:

\[C_{m} = 9N_{0}\int_{0}^{x_{0}}dx\,x^{2}\left\{\left[u^{2}-2u\frac{dy}{ dt}+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^{2}\right]\right.\] (4) \[\times\left[-\frac{1}{u}-\frac{1}{2u^{2}}+\psi^{\prime}(u)\right]\] \[\left.-t\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}\left[\ln u-\frac{1}{2u}-\psi(u) \right]\right\},\]

15 April A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer was used to study magnetic properties from 2.5 up to 300 K in fields up to 6 T using polycrystalline specimens of about 20 mg. Specific heat measurements on about 1 g of polycrystalline Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} were performed at temperatures ranging from 2.5 up to 100 K by means of an adiabatic step heating method. Additionally, specific heat measurements in the temperature range between 350 mK and 20 K were carried on La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} and Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} samples with a commercial Quantum Design PPMS ^{3}He relaxation calorimeter in fields up to 1 T. Electrical resistivity measurements were carried out in a ^{3}He bath top-loading cryostat with a maximum magnetic field of 12.5 T and for temperatures from 350 mK up to 300 K. Resistivity was measured with the electrical current flowing parallel to the applied magnetic field via a four-probe technique using an ac bridge (Lakeshore 370).

## III Results and Discussion

The XRD analyses indicate that RE_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} phases with La and Ce as rare earth elements are present as a major phase with a minor amount of impurity phases. The XRD pattern of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} together with the corresponding Rietveld refinement are shown in Fig. 1, revealing a=0.42358(1) nm, b=0.42900(1) nm, and c=2.45400(7) nm. Some small extra XRD peaks could be indexed on the basis of a La_{2}Pd_{3}Si_{3} phase. The content of impurities is estimated to be a few percent in each sample. In the case of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} these small impurity phases were identified as Ce_{2}Pd_{3}Si_{3} (Ce_{2}Rh_{1.35}Ge_{4.65} type) and CeOPd_{2}Si_{2} (ThCr_{2}Si_{2} type) in agreement with the Ce-Pd-Si phase diagram [3], where these two phases were reported as neighboring phases.

### La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}

Both resistivity and heat capacity measurements carried out on La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} evidence bulk superconductivity below 2 K. Shown in Fig. 2 is the temperature dependent electrical resistivity \rho of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} at zero field (main panel) and at various externally applied magnetic fields. Clearly visible is a superconducting transition being located slightly above 2 K. This transition temperature is in good coincidence with data reported in Refs. [6] and [7] derived from measurements of the electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility. Metallic behavior and the importance of _s-d_ scattering in La_{3}Pd_{3}Si_{4} is quantitatively revealed from the applicability of the Bloch-Wilson model [18], i.e.,

\[\rho(T) = A\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{D}}\right)^{5}\int_{0}^{\theta_{D}/T} \frac{z^{5}dz}{[\exp(z)-1][1-\exp(-z)]}\] \[\quad+B\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{D}}\right)^{3}\int_{\theta_{\rm min }/T}^{\theta_{D}/T}\frac{z^{3}dz}{[\exp(z)-1][1-\exp(-z)]}-\kappa\,T^{3}.\]

The Mott-Jones term \kappa\,T^{3} accounts for scattering of conduction electrons on a narrow d band (e.g., Pd-4d or La-5d in La_{3}Pd_{3}Si_{4}) near to the Fermi energy [19] and explains the negative curvature in \rho(T) at higher temperatures. A least-squares fit of this model to the experimental data (solid line, Fig. 2) reveals a Debye temperature \theta_{D}=155 K, and \kappa\approx 10^{-7}\mu\Omega cm K^{-3} as well as a minimum phonon energy k_{B}\theta_{\rm min}=\hbar\omega_{\rm min}, with \theta_{\rm min}=98 K. Here \omega_{\rm min} is the frequency corresponding to the minimum \vec{q} value to excite the _s-d_ transitions [18]. A=54\mu\Omega cm and B=8.6\mu\Omega cm are material dependent constants (compare Fig. 5, too).

The superconducting phase transition is relatively sharp, evidencing good sample quality. The application of magnetic fields (inset, Fig. 2) consecutively suppresses superconductivity, and magnetic fields of the order of 1 T are sufficient to entirely eliminate the superconducting state. This suppression is accompanied by a slight increase of the width of the phase transition. The Debye temperature as derived from resistivity data is significantly lower than that derived from our specific heat measurements (see below). This might be a result of

  non-negligible electron-electron scattering superimposed to electron-phonon scattering.

To proof whether superconductivity in La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is of bulk nature and does not refer to an impurity phase, heat capacity measurements C_{p}(T) have been carried out for temperatures down to 350 mK and for magnetic fields up to 0.4 T. Results are displayed in Fig. 3. Bulk superconductivity is obvious from the distinct anomaly of C_{p}/T around 2 K. An accurate determination of the superconducting transition temperature can be made from an idealized jump of the heat capacity anomaly (solid line, Fig. 3) by a balance of entropy, yielding T_{c}=1.98 K, in good agreement with the resistivity data. The ideal peak height of the SC anomaly would then be 27 mJ/mol K^{2}.

An estimation of the normal state Sommerfeld value \gamma_{n} within the temperature range between 2 and 5 K, reveals 26 mJ/mol K^{2}, and, additionally, \theta_{D}=280 K. A similar \gamma value is obtained if field measurements (e.g., \mu_{0}H=0.4 T) are considered, resulting in \gamma_{n}=28 mJ/mol K^{2}. The latter, however, is derived within a much smaller range of extrapolation.

From the jump of the specific heat \Delta C_{p}/T(T=T_{c})\approx 27 mJ/mol K^{2}, we calculate the parameter \Delta C_{p}/(\gamma_{n}T_{c})\approx 1.03, which is below the figure expected from BCS theory, \Delta C_{p}/(\gamma\,T_{c})\approx 1.43.

Deviations from a standard BCS behavior are also evident from the temperature dependent specific heat. Compared in Fig. 4(a) are the experimental heat capacity data of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} plotted in a normalized representation C_{p}/(\gamma_{n}T_{c}), together with the heat capacity of a fully gapped s-wave superconductor as tabulated by Muhlschlegel[20] [solid line, Fig. 4(a)] and a simple power law C_{p}\propto T^{3} [dashed-double-dotted line, Fig. 4(a)]. The latter would indicate point nodes in the superconducting gap. Obviously both models do not properly account for the experimental data, specifically in the low temperature range.

A further model calculation is based on a two gap scenario employing the so-called \alpha model developed by Padamsee _et al.[21]_ with only one adjustable parameter \alpha=\Delta(0)/(k_{B}T_{c}). Note, the value \alpha=1.764 corresponds to the weak coupling BCS limit. The heat capacity in the superconducting state is then a sum of individual contributions of both gaps \Delta_{i}(0), together with the ratio \gamma_{1}/\gamma_{2}, with the partial specific heat contributions \gamma_{1}+\gamma_{2}=\gamma_{n}. Such calculations have been successfully applied to MgB_{2},[22] to borocarbide superconductors,[23] or recently to the ternary iron-silicide Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5}.[24] Employing this model to La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} with \alpha_{1}=1.95, \alpha_{2}=1.1, and \gamma_{1}/\gamma_{2}=0.7/0.3 [dashed line, Fig. 4(a)] reveals convincing agreement with the experimental data in an extended temperature range. Such a two gap model would also be in line with the pronounced positive curvature found for the upper critical field of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} (see below). The temperature dependent difference between the experimental data and the three theoretical models are shown in Fig. 4(b), clearly demonstrating the superior agreement of the two gap scenario over a fully gapped s-wave model or the simple power law.

As shown in Fig. 3, both the transition temperature and the jump of the specific heat at T_{c} become suppressed with increasing externally applied magnetic fields. This field dependent lowering of T_{c} is outlined in Fig. 4(b), where both resistivity and heat capacity data are summarized. As it is obvious from this figure, T_{c}(\mu_{0}H) shows a superlinear dependence, reaching an upper critical field at zero temperature \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) of about 0.6 T. A typical BCS superconductor, however, would exhibit a sublinear temperature dependence \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T). In absence of low temperature measurements, Fujii[7, 6] estimated an upper

The solid line is the heat capacity of a fully gapped BCS superconductor, whereas the dashed line represents a model with two different superconducting gaps. For details see the text. The dashedâ€“double-dotted line is a power law C_{p}\propto T^{3}. (b) Temperature dependent difference \delta of experimental and theoretical heat capacity data C_{p}/(\gamma_{n}T_{c}) below T_{c}. The colors refer to (a). (c) Upper critical magnetic field \mu_{0}H_{c2} of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} as derived from resistivity (50% criterion) and specific heat data (thermodynamic mean value of the transition). The dashed line is a least-squares fit employing Eq. (1) and the solid line is a fit based on the WHH model (see text). The dashed-dotted line is the thermodynamic critical field.

  critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2}\approx 0.33 T from a simple extrapolation of susceptibility results.

The unusual temperature dependence of the upper critical field of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} can have different microscopic origins: (i) The existence of more than one Fermi-surface sheet with energy gaps of different magnitudes as reported, e.g., for binary MgB_{2}, or (ii) strong anisotropies of the superconducting order parameter residing on a single Fermi-surface sheet.

Positive curvatures of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) have been observed, e.g., for the nonmagnetic rare-earth nickel borocarbides RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R = Y, Lu) and were explained theoretically employing effective two-band models.[25, 26] Phenomenologically, \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) of borocarbides and MgB_{2} were accounted for in a wide temperature range using the simple expression[27]

\[\mu_{0}H_{c2}=\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(1-T/T_{c})^{1+\beta},\] (2)

where \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*} and \beta are fitting parameters. Similar to the borocarbide case and MgB_{2}, \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}, as displayed in Fig. 4(c), can be described on the basis of Eq. (2). A least-squares fit is shown in Fig. 4(c) as a dashed line revealing H_{c2}^{*}=0.6 and \beta=0.77. Exponents of a similar order were derived for borocarbides and MgB_{2}, too.

Werthamer _et al.[28]_ derived an expression (abbreviated as _WHH model_) for the upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2} in terms of orbital pair breaking, including the effect of Pauli spin paramagnetism and spin-orbit scattering. The WHH model is ruled by two parameters, namely \alpha_{M}, the Pauli paramagnetic limitation (= Maki parameter[29]), and \lambda_{\infty}, describing spin-orbit scattering. While the value of \alpha_{M} allows a rough discrimination between orbital pair breaking and Pauli limiting, \lambda_{\infty} becomes non-negligible for heavier atoms.

The Maki parameter \alpha_{M} can be estimated[28] from the Sommerfeld value \gamma and the residual resistivity \rho_{0} as \alpha_{M}=0.23. The reasonably low value of \alpha indicates that orbital pair breaking in La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is the essential mechanism, limiting the upper critical field. The overall temperature dependence of \mu_{0}H_{c2} as derived from the WHH model is displayed as a solid line in Fig. 4(b), revealing \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=0.21 T, which is more than two times smaller than the experimentally observed data.

The thermodynamic critical field is calculated from the free energy difference between the superconducting and normal state, given by the expression \Delta F(T)=F_{n}-F_{t}=\mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}(T)/2=\int_{T_{c}}^{T}\int_{T_{c}}^{T} \frac{(C-C_{n})}{T}dT^{\prime\prime}dT^{\prime}. The quantity C_{n}(T) is obtained from the zero field specific heat measurement, whereas C_{n}(T) is obtained from the data corresponding to the 0.4 T run. The values derived are displayed in Fig. 4(b) as a dashed-dotted line; an extrapolation to T\to 0 yields \mu_{0}H_{c}(0)\approx 0.04 T. This allows us to evaluate a value for the dimensionless Ginzburg Landau parameter \kappa_{\rm GL}=H_{c2}(0)/(\sqrt{2}H_{c})\simeq 9.8, where the experimentally determined H_{c2}(0)=0.55 T has been used. The coherence length \xi_{0} for T\to 0 can be obtained from \mu_{0}H_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\,\xi_{0}^{2}), yielding \xi_{0}\simeq 2.44\times 10^{-8} m. Combining the Ginzburg Landau parameter with the coherence length, the London penetration depth can be obtained as \lambda_{L}(T\to 0)\simeq 2.39\times 10^{-7} m.

An estimation of the electron-phonon interaction strength \lambda_{v,\rm ph} is possible in terms of the McMillan formula.[30] Applying this model, and taking the repulsive screened Coulomb part \mu^{*}\approx 0.13, yields \lambda_{v,\rm ph}\approx 0.52; this characterizes La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} as a SC in the weak coupling limit.

Similarly, an electron-phonon enhancement factor of about the same magnitude can be found if recent electronic structure calculations are considered,[31] where the calculated density of states at the Fermi energy corresponds to a bare band value \gamma_{b}=19.8 mJ/mol K^{2}. A comparison with the experimentally derived Sommerfeld value \gamma=29 mJ/mol K^{2} yields \lambda_{v,\rm ph}\approx 0.46, supporting the weak coupling regime.

Based on the value of l_{\rm tr}/\xi\approx 0.75 we classify La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} as a weakly coupled superconductor in the dirty limit; the value of \kappa_{\rm GL}\approx 10 refers to a type II superconductor.

### Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}

Intermetallic compounds based on Ce are known a long time for a variety of interesting ground states, primarily triggered by the Kondo effect as a result of distinct interactions between conduction electrons and the magnetic moment of the Ce ion. In the following, results derived from resistivity, heat capacity, and magnetization measurements will be used to obtain information on the ground state properties of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}.

Shown in Fig. 5 are temperature dependent resistivity measurements of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} and of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}; the latter compound serves as a nonmagnetic reference, representing the contribution to the electrical resistivity owing to the electron-phonon interaction. While \rho(T) of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} exhibits superconductivity below 2 K and a simple metallic behavior in the normal state region (see the previous section), \rho(T) of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} shows a much more complex temperature dependence as typical for Kondo lattice systems. The most dominant feature is a maximum in \rho(T) around 8.5 K with \rho(T) dropping above and below this temperature. Well above 100 K, a local minimum develops in \rho(T). A comparison of the experimental data of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} and La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} allows

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature dependent resistivity \rho of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} and Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} plotted on a logarithmic temperature scale. The magnetic contribution \rho_{\rm mag}(T) of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is also shown in this plot, where the dashed line should emphasize Kondo interaction; \rho_{\rm mag}\approx\rho(\rm Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4})-\rho(\rm La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}). The solid line is a least-squares fit as explained in Fig. 2.

  us to derive the magnetic part \rho_{\rm mag} if one assumes that the phonon contribution of both compounds is equal. \rho_{\rm mag}(T) of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is included in Fig. 5, too. The logarithmic temperature dependence of \rho_{\rm mag} at elevated temperatures evidences Kondo interaction in the presence of crystalline electric field splitting. The drop of \rho(T) at low temperatures results from the development of a coherent state owing to the Kondo lattice properties of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}. In general, such a coherent state would be concomitant with Fermi-liquid features, and a T^{2} behavior of \rho_{\rm mag}(T) should become obvious. The present experimental data, however, reveal a distinctly different power law.

A closer inspection of the low temperature resistivity data is shown in Fig. 6, where measurements at various magnetic fields are added. The low temperature maximum in \rho(T) is weakly field dependent and shifts from about 8.5 K at zero magnetic field to about 10.5 K at an externally applied field of 8 T. Such a field dependence of the electrical resistivity is typical for cerium and ytterbium based Kondo lattices. At the lowest temperatures of our study, Fermi-liquid features are absent in \rho(T). Rather, the zero field measurement can be accounted for by a simple power law \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}, where the exponent n=1 reveals best agreement; in the case of the 12 T run, n=1.15. These exponents are indicative of a non-Fermi-liquid behavior, arising, most likely, from the proximity of a magnetic instability of the Ce ions.

A magnetic state of the Ce ions in Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}, can be concluded from magnetic susceptibility measurements \chi(T) as shown in Fig. 7. Applying a modified Curie-Weiss law to the experimental data, i.e.,

\[\chi=\chi_{0}+\frac{C}{T-\theta_{p}},\] (3)

yields information concerning a temperature independent Pauli contribution \chi_{0}, the effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} (deduced from the Curie constant C), and the paramagnetic Curie temperature \theta_{p}. Results of a least-squares fit (T>50 K) according to Eq. (3) are shown as a solid line in Fig. 7, revealing an effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff}=2.51\mu_{B} close to that of the Ce-4f^{1} electronic configuration [\mu_{\rm eff}({\rm Ce^{3+}})=2.54\mu_{\rm B}] and a paramagnetic Curie temperature \theta_{p}=-29 K. The latter refers to antiferromagnetic interactions among the Ce ions. \chi(T) at low temperatures does not show any characteristic anomaly being typical for long range magnetic order. This is in line with isothermal magnetization data taken at T=2 K (inset, Fig. 7). A smooth, slightly curvilinear M(H) dependence is observed with relatively small magnetization values at 6 T. A description of these data can be done calculating the field dependent magnetization of an effective spin 1/2 system at T=2 K, employing a Lande factor g_{\rm eff}=0.775. Fairly good agreement is obtained in this way, except for the low field range, where the disagreement between the model and the experimental data appears to be in line with the Curie-like bending of the magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures. CEF effects are the primary cause for the appearance of only small magnetization values, well below g_{j}j=2.14\mu_{B}, associated with the total angular momentum of the free Ce^{3+} ion. A comparison with magnetization data of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Ge_{4} at T=2 K [35] shows for the latter a clear indication for a metamagnetic phase transition around 4 T, thus referring to an antiferromagnetic ground state.

To further prove the ground state of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}, heat capacity measurements C_{p} have been performed down to 400 mK. Results are displayed in Fig. 8 as C_{p}/T vs T, together with those of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}. The most prominent feature is an almost logarithmic contribution in the range of a few Kelvin, followed by a smooth saturation of C_{p}/T towards zero with very large values of about 2.7 J/mol K^{2}, corresponding to \gamma=0.9 J/mol K^{2} per cerium ion. Considering renormalization group calculations by Oliveira and Wilkins,[32] the Kondo temperature T_{K} follows from T_{K}=0.68\cdot R/\gamma=6.2 K if a doublet is considered as ground state.

Figure 7: (Color online) Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility \chi of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} plotted as 1/\chi vs T. The solid line is a fit employing a modified Curie-Weiss law. The inset displays the isothermal magnetization (T=2 K) of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}; the solid line is the magnetization of an effective spin 1/2 system with a Lande factor g_{\rm eff}=0.775.

  Assuming that the phonon contribution to the heat capacity of Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} can be represented by the specific heat of La_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4}, the magnetic entropy S_{\rm mag} can be derived by integrating C_{\rm mag}/\,T. Results of this evaluation are plotted in Fig. 8 as a dashed line, referring to the right axis. An entropy of 3\cdot R\ln 2 is reached around 18 K. The slow rate of the recovery of magnetic entropy in Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is a consequence of the Kondo effect present in this compound. S_{\rm mag}(T) also allows us to estimate the Kondo temperature independently from T_{K}=T(S_{\rm mag}\approx 0.45\cdot R\ln 2)\approx 4.4 K [33], in very good agreement with the estimation obtained from the Sommerfeld value. Kondo-type interaction is also supposed to be responsible for the suppression of long range magnetic order, absent in Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} at least down to 400 mK.

The further increase of S_{\rm mag} at higher temperatures indicates that the excited crystalline electric field levels are not well separated from the ground state; hence some hybridization between CEF levels might appear. This is seen from some deformation of the maximum of the magnetic contribution to the electrical resistivity, too.

In order to test whether or not Ce_{3}Pd_{4}Si_{4} is at or near the quantum critical point, the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) model of Moriya and Takimoto [14] can be taken into account:

\[C_{m} = 9N_{0}\int_{0}^{x_{0}}dx\,x^{2}\left\{\left[u^{2}-2u\frac{dy}{ dt}+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^{2}\right]\right.\] (4) \[\times\left[-\frac{1}{u}-\frac{1}{2u^{2}}+\psi^{\prime}(u)\right]\] \[\left.-t\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}\left[\ln u-\frac{1}{2u}-\psi(u) \right]\right\},\]
