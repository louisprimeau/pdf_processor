###### Abstract

We report the phase diagram of the doping series U₂Pt_(x)Rh_(1 − x)C₂,
studied through measurements of resistivity, specific heat, and magnetic
susceptibility. The Neel temperature of U₂RhC₂ of ∼22 K is suppressed
with increasing Pt content, reaching zero temperature close to x = 0.7,
where we observed signatures of increased quantum fluctuations. In
addition, evidence is presented that the antiferromagnetic state
undergoes a spin-reorientation transition upon application of an applied
magnetic field. This transition shows nonmonotonic behavior as a
function of x, peaking at around x = 0.3. Superconductivity is observed
for x ≥ 0.9, with $T_{\rm c}$ increasing with increasing x. The
reduction in $T_{\rm c}$ and increase in residual resistivity with
decreasing Pt content is inconsistent with the extension of the
Abrikosov-Gor’kov theory to unconventional superconductivity.

## 1 Introduction

The study of superconductivity and magnetism in uranium based
heavy-fermion materials has provided a rich array of physics that has
challenged and guided our understanding for several decades. Notable
examples are the superconductivity in UBe₁₃[1], as well as the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, multiple superconducting phases, and
evidence for triplet pairing seen in UPt₃[2]. Recently, the study of
unconventional superconductivity has focused on the role of quantum
fluctuations associated with the suppression of a second order phase
transition to zero temperature, such as in URhGe under an applied
magnetic field [3, 4]. U₂PtC₂ is a so-called "nearly-heavy-fermion"
system because of its moderately enhanced electron effective mass of
order 100 times that of a free electron [5]. It becomes superconducting
below the transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=1.47$ K, and does not
display long range magnetic order [5, 6, 7, 8]. The mechanism for
superconductivity in U₂PtC₂ is an open question. Recent nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) measurements of U₂PtC₂ have shown evidence for spin
triplet pairing and unconventional superconductivity [9]. Isostructural
U₂RhC₂ displays no superconductivity but orders antiferromagnetically at
a Neel temperature $T_{\rm N}\sim 22$ K, and shows evidence for possible
"complex magnetic behavior" at lower temperatures [8].

Given the nature of the parent compounds, the doping series
U₂Pt_(x)Rh_(1 − x)C₂ must show some evolution between a magnetically
ordered and superconducting ground state. Here we report thermodynamic
and transport measurements of U₂Pt_(x)Rh_(1 − x)C₂ and find that with
increasing platinum content $T_{\rm N}$ is suppressed to zero
temperature close to x = 0.7, where we observe evidence for quantum
critical fluctuations. However, superconductivity is not observed until
x = 0.9, where signatures of these fluctuations are almost entirely
absent. $T_{\rm c}$ is maximal in U₂PtC₂. Study of the magnetic field
dependence of the AFM state has revealed evidence of a
spin-reorientation transition. We discuss the possible implications of
our results with respect to competing magnetic interactions and
superconductivity.

## 2 Sample preparation

Polycrystalline U₂Pt_(x)Rh_(1 − x)C₂ samples were made by arc melting
and subsequent annealing. Depleted-U, Pt, Rh, and C were weighed out
according to the ratio of U:Pt:Rh:C of 2 : 1.1x : 1.1(1 − x) : 2.2. This
ratio was found to produce a lower UC impurity content than the other
ratios attempted of 2 : x : (1 − x) : 2 or 2 : 2x : 2(1 − x) : 2.4.
During the arc melting, the resulting button was flipped and melted
several times. The button was then wrapped in Ta foil and sealed in a
quartz tube under vacuum before being annealed for 2 months at 1050
degC. Annealing of the product was necessary to further reduce the
impurity content. Growths of single crystals were attempted using Bi,
Zn, Al, Ga, Sn, Sb, and U fluxes, but were not successful. Powder x-ray
diffraction of the polycrystalline samples confirmed that U₂PtC₂ and
U₂RhC₂ possess the Na₂HgO₂ structure type in which all the U sites are
equivalent, as first discussed for the isostructural case of U₂IrC₂[10].
The lattice parameters as a function of x are shown in Fig. 1.

The powder x-ray diffraction patterns for U₂PtC₂, U₂Pt_(0.7)Rh_(0.3)C₂,
and U₂RhC₂ are shown in Figs. 2(a)-2(c), respectively. Detectable
impurity phases in powder x-ray patterns of the various doped samples
were the paramagnetic materials UC, UC₂, Rh, or Pt. These were all at a
concentration of less than 10

## III Phase Diagram

The zero field phase diagram of U₂Pt_(x)Rh_(1 − x)C₂ shown in Fig. 4 was
established from measurements of the resistivity ρ, specific heat C, and
magnetic susceptibility χ, shown in Fig. 5 as a function of temperature
T. The C/T data shown in Fig. 5(a) are shifted by 1000(1 − x) mJ/mol
f.u. K² for clarity. The electrical resistivity of the samples was
measured using a four-probe low frequency ac resistance bridge with
spot-welded contacts of platinum wires. Specific heat measurements were
performed using the time-relaxation method. Both of these measurements
were performed within the Quantum Design physical property measurement
system (PPMS). Magnetic susceptibility was measured using a
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in the
Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS).

The AFM transition is observed in U₂RhC₂ as an anomaly in the specific
heat and a peak in the magnetic susceptibility, coincident in
temperature, at 21.6 K. The temperature of the

transition slightly increases in x = 0.1, and then is suppressed and
broadened with increasing Pt content. As the Neel temperature is
suppressed to zero temperature with increasing x, there is an upturn in
C/T at low temperatures, suggestive of quantum fluctuations. The rate of
the low temperature increase in C/T is greatest in the x = 0.7 sample,
and at this doping the magnetic susceptibility also increases rapidly at
low temperatures. Furthermore, x = 0.7 is the lowest doping in which an
AFM transition is not observed above 0.38 K. Superconductivity is
observed, above the lowest measured temperature of 0.38 K, only in
samples in which x ≥ 0.9, with $T_{\rm c}$ increasing with increasing Pt
content. At x = 0.3 a first order anomaly was observed in the specific
heat at 30 K. This anomaly was reproducible between several crystals at
this doping, but no corresponding feature was observed in the magnetic
susceptibility or resistivity, and this type of anomaly was not observed
at any other doping. The origin of the anomaly is not known.

An additional anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility is observed at
around 16 K in some samples with x ≥ 0.7. This is particularly prominent
in the x = 1 measurement at 0.1 T, although it is not present in the
high field data. No corresponding feature is seen in the resistivity or
specific heat measurements. These susceptibility features are likely to
be an extrinsic impurity contribution. UPt₂C_(0.1) and UPt₂C_(0.2) were
synthesized in order to investigate the possible contribution of the
UPt₂C_(y) (y ≤ 2) impurity seen in EDX measurements. Measurements of the
magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity, not shown here, showed a
small anomaly in magnetic susceptibility at ∼15 K, with no corresponding
feature in the specific heat. Therefore it is possible that this feature
is responsible for the observed anomaly in the U₂Pt_(x)Rh_(1 − x)C₂
data. In addition, the presence of a small concentration of UPt, which
shows a peak in magnetic susceptibility at ∼17 K, cannot be excluded
[11, 12]. However, we cannot rule out that the feature may be intrinsic,
reminiscent of UPt₃[2].

## IV Magnetic Field Study

In order to further investigate the magnetism in U₂Pt_(x)Rh_(1 − x)C₂,
thermodynamic and transport measurements

were also taken under an applied magnetic field H. Isotherms of
magnetization M as a function of applied field are shown in Fig. 6 for
U₂RhC₂.

These data show a metamagnetic transition from the AFM state at a
characteristic field that increases with increasing temperature. This is
likely to be a spin-reorientation transition, such as a spin-flop or
spin-flip transition. The transition is clearly first order, as
evidenced by the hysteresis observed in M(H) between increasing and
decreasing field sweeps. The saturation value of the magnetic moment at
2.1 K estimated from these data is ∼0.3μ_(B)/U. This small value is
suggestive of itinerant antiferromagnetism. The inset to Fig. 6 shows
the measured magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature. The
data above 75 K were fitted with a modified Curie-Weiss law because of a
large temperature independent contribution. This is given by
χ = C_(c)/(T − Θ) + χ₀, where C_(c) = 2.8 × 10⁻⁴ emu/g K is the Curie
constant, Θ = 44 K is the Weiss constant, and χ₀ = 3.7 × 10⁻⁶ emu/g is
the temperature independent susceptibility contribution. The effective
moment estimated from the Curie constant is 2.8μ_(B)/U. This means the
Rhodes-Wolfarth ratio of the effective to saturated moment for U₂RhC₂ is
∼9, which again implies that the magnetism is itinerant [13].

The magnetic contribution to the specific heat $C_{\rm mag}$ was
isolated from C by subtracting the phonon contribution to the specific
heat of the paramagnetic isostructural analog U₂OsC₂. The data for
$C_{\rm mag}/T$ are shown in Fig. 7. This figure shows the Neel
temperature in zero field as a sharp peak in $C_{\rm mag}/T$ at 21.6 K.
This peak broadens with increasing field, and the peak shifts to lower
temperature. At 1 T there is an anomaly in $C_{\rm mag}/T$ near 10 K, in
addition to the AFM transition, which we identify as associated with the
spin-reorientation transition. The temperature of this feature increases
with increasing field, eventually coinciding with the broadened higher
temperature peak. The inset to Fig. 7 shows the magnetic contribution to
the entropy as function of temperature, which reaches ∼0.4R ln(2) at
$T_{\rm N}$. The small entropy is also suggestive of itinerant
magnetism, and is comparable to other U based antiferromagnets thought
to be itinerant, such as UCT₂Si₂[14] and UPd₂Al₃[15]. The magnetic
anisotropy required to produce a spin-reorientation transition in an
itinerant system could be the result of dipole-dipole interactions or
spin-orbit coupling. Such scenarios have been suggested in UCT₂Si₂[14]
and (TMTSF)₂AsF₆[16]. In zero field the electron specific heat
coefficient γ = 160 mJ/mol f.u. K². Many uranium based materials, such
as U₂Zn₁₇[17], show a significant reduction of γ upon entering the
magnetically ordered state, and therefore it is likely that the density
of states in U₂RhC₂ in the paramagnetic state is considerably larger
than in U₂PtC₂.

The AFM and spin-reorientation transitions can be seen in ρ(T) at
various magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the current, shown in
Fig. 8. The Neel temperature appears as a kink in the zero field ρ(T)
curve, as indicated by the dashed arrow, and appears as a dip in dρ/dT
shown in the inset to Fig. 8 for 0 and 1 T. This is reminiscent of the
resistivity feature in Cr at $T_{\rm N}$, where the antiferromagnetism
is believed to be itinerant and the kink arises from an energy gap
forming on regions of the Fermi surface, leading to a loss of charge
carriers and increased resistivity [18]. However, in Cr the
magnetoresistance is positive, arising from the additional scattering
associated with cyclotron orbits of the electrons around the Fermi
surface [18]. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 8, the magnetoresistance in
U₂RhC₂ is negative both above and below $T_{\rm N}$. UNiAl and UNiGa
both show anomalies in the resistivity at T_(N), and display a strong
negative magnetoresistance that saturates at high field, in close
similarity to the data in Fig. 8. The negative magnetoresistance in
UNiAl and UNiGa is attributed to field-induced superzone reconstructions
of the Fermi surface [19, 20]. A similar mechanism may contribute to the
large negative magnetoresistance

line shows the fit to a modified Curie-Weiss law above 75 K.

in U₂RhC₂. In addition, however, the magnetoresistance may have a
significant contribution from spin-disorder scattering in the system,
and the suppression of the spin fluctuations with magnetic field, as
seen, for example, in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As [21].

The spin-reorientation transition is seen at 1 T in Fig. 8 as a peak in
dρ/dT coincident in temperature with the feature in $C_{\rm mag}/T$ at
around 10 K shown in Fig. 7. This transition is marked with a solid
arrow in Fig. 8. At each doping, the field at which the
spin-reorientation transition occurs at 2.5 K was established from the
maximum of the derivative of the field dependent transverse
magnetoresistance plotted in Fig. 9(a). This transition field is shown
in Fig. 9(b) as a function of doping. This field is in reasonable
agreement with the maximum of the slope of the magnetization shown for
several dopings in Fig. 9(c) at 2.1 K.

It is interesting to note that in U₂RhC₂ at 2.5 K the spin-reorientation
field is only 0.5 T. This is a remarkably small field compared to the
Neel temperature of 22 K, and it is perhaps suggestive of ferromagnetic
correlations within the system. The positive Weiss constant in the
modified Curie-Weiss fit to the high temperature magnetic
susceptibility, discussed above, may also suggest the presence of
ferromagnetic correlations. More definitive evidence for these
correlations would require further investigation, however, for example,
by neutron scattering or NMR measurements.

## V Superconductivity

Specific heat measurements indicate that superconductivity in U₂PtC₂
emerges from a renormalized, but otherwise conventional, Fermi liquid
state. Figure 5 shows that $T_{\rm c}$ is maximal in the parent compound
U₂PtC₂, and is suppressed as the Pt content is reduced. In contrast, the
strength of the quantum critical fluctuations, as measured by the
magnitude of the upturn in C/T, is maximal close to x = 0.7, and is
completely suppressed as Pt content increases towards x = 1. This
suggests that perhaps the antiferromagnetic quantum fluctuations do not
enhance the superconducting pairing. Indeed, recent NMR measurements in
U₂PtC₂ have shown evidence for unconventional superconductivity and,
more specifically, spin-triplet pairing [9]. Hence, the nature of the
superconducting state requires closer investigation.

The $T_{\rm c}$ of unconventional superconductors that are believed to
possess a spin-triplet pairing state is very sensitive to nonmagnetic
impurities [22, 23]. Hence, the reduced $T_{\rm c}$ in doped samples may
arise from the pair breaking arising from additional disorder, rather
than a reduction of pairing strength. In this regard, it is surprising
that $T_{\rm c}$ is not already completely suppressed at x = 0.9. The
residual resistivity of U₂PtC₂ is ∼5 μΩ cm. The mean free path l can be
estimated from the electronic specific heat coefficient per unit volume
$\gamma_{\rm c}=k_{B}^{2}m^{*}k_{F}/3\hbar^{2}$, the penetration depth
λ = m^(*)/μ₀ne², the residual resistivity ρ₀ = m^(*)/ne²τ, and the Fermi
wave vector k_(F) = (3π²n)^(1/3), where k_(B) is the Boltzmann constant,
m^(*) is the effective electron mass, μ₀ is the permeability of free
space, and τ is the electron scattering time [24]. In U₂PtC₂ we estimate
l ∼ 700 A. The intrinsic coherence length ξ₀ is estimated to be ∼70 A,
from measurements of the upper critical magnetic field H_(c2), and the
equation H_(c2)(0) = Φ₀/(2πξ₀²), where Φ₀ is the flux quantum. Hence,
l ≫ ξ and U₂PtC₂ is in the clean limit. However, the residual
resistivity in x = 0.9 is ρ₀ ∼ 42μΩ cm. Assuming that the effective mass
and electron density are not significantly altered by the introduction
of 10

In the extension of Abrikosov-Gor’kov theory of pair breaking scattering
to unconventional superconductivity, in the limit of ξ ≈ l the
superconductivity is predicted to be completely suppressed [25, 26, 27].
However, $T_{\rm c}$ is only reduced from 1.45 K in U₂Pt₂ to 1.09 K in
x = 0.9. In addition, little variation of $T_{\rm c}$ was seen in our
measurements of U₂Pt₂, and in previous measurements of U₂PtC₂, with a
residual resistivity of ∼10 μΩ cm, $T_{\rm c}$ was 1.5 K [7]. Such
insensitivity to impurities is difficult to reconcile with a scenario of
non-s-wave superconductivity. However, several established
unconventional superconductors, such as organic [22], cuprate [28],
pnictide [29], and heavy-fermion superconductors [30, 31], deviate from
the Abrikosov-Gor’kov theory, with explanations ranging from spatial
variation of the gap function [32], the effect of a combination of
magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities [33], or interactions between
paramagnetic impurities [34]. Hence, a definitive statement about the
nature of the superconducting state will require further investigation,
and, in particular, would benefit from the growth of single crystals and
detailed studies of the gap symmetry.

## VI Conclusion

We have determined the phase diagram of the doping series
U₂Pt_(x)Rh_(1 − x)C₂, demonstrating the suppression of the
antiferromagnetic phase transition in U₂RhC₂ to zero temperature close
to x = 0.7, where we observe evidence of quantum fluctuations. The
antiferromagnetic state undergoes a spin-reorientation transition in an
applied magnetic field. The spin-reorientation field is nonmonotonic as
a function of doping, with a maximum around x = 0.3. Superconductivity
is observed for x ≥ 0.9 and $T_{\rm c}$ is maximal in U₂PtC₂. The
suppression of $T_{\rm c}$ with the increased residual resistivity of
the x = 0.9 sample is inconsistent with the extension of
Abrikosov-Gor’kov theory to unconventional superconductors.
