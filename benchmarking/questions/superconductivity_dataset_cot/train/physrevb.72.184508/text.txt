###### Abstract

High-pressure, angular-dispersive, x-ray diffraction measurements have been performed on "115" superconductors Ce_M_In\({}_{\rm 5}\) and Pu_M_Ga\({}_{\rm 5}\) for \(M\) = Co and Rh. The principal results are of the pressure-dependence of the ratio of the tetragonal lattice parameters, _c/a_, in each system, which are presented for the purpose of understanding the role that this parameter plays in controlling the value of the superconducting temperature _T_c. In none of the systems investigated does _c/a_ scale linearly with the value of _T_c under pressure, suggesting that it is not the main parameter to control _T_c. Values of bulk modulus determined from these measurements are also presented.

2005 2005  radioactivity of the transuranic material. In collaboration with other laboratories, we have performed high-\(P\) XRD experiments on transuranic elements--see, for example, Refs. 16 and 17. The unique methods developed for performing DAC loadings of transuranic materials (reported in these papers) have been employed in this study.

## II II. Experiment

Powder samples of Ce\(M\)In\({}_{5}\) and Pu\(M\)Ga\({}_{5}\) (\(M\) = Co, Rh) were prepared from starting samples in single-crystal Ce\(M\)In\({}_{5}\) samples were prepared at Los Alamos National Laboratory using the self-flux technique.[7] Single-crystal Pu\(M\)Ga\({}_{5}\) samples were prepared at the Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU), Karlsruhe using a similar (self-flux) method. Powder quantities of ~10 \(\mu\)g, for each compound, were loaded into DACs. For all studies, except that on PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), Syassen-Holzapfel type cells (maximum x-ray scattering angle 2\(\theta_{\rm max}\) = 14\({}^{\circ}\)) were employed. For the PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) study, a Le-Toullec type (membrane) cell (2\(\theta_{\rm max}\)  \(\approx\) 21\({}^{\circ}\)) was used. In all cells, diamond flats were of 300 \(\mu\)m diameter, and inconel gaskets of 150 \(\mu\)m (diameter) hole-size and (indented) thickness 50 \(\mu\)m were used. To avoid the risk of contamination of any exterior part of the DAC by the Pu-containing powder sample, the Pu\(M\)Ga\({}_{5}\) powders were combined with a small amount of epoxy resin to form solid ("granular") pieces, which were loaded into the DACs. Silicon oil (hereafter referred to as "oil") was used as the pressure-transmitting medium (PTM) for all compounds. However, in the case of CeRhIn\({}_{5}\), a second loading was performed using liquid nitrogen (N\({}_{2}\)) as PTM. Pressure was calibrated by the ruby fluorescence method (for each DAC, a single, ruby ball of diameter \(<\)20 \(\mu\)m was used). Throughout each high-\(P\) run, the hole of the gasket was monitored to ensure no "gasket failure" (i.e., a sudden distortion from the circular form of the gasket hole) occurred.

All ADXRD experiments were carried out on the ID30 (undulator) beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), except for the PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) study, which used a rotating anode x-ray generator (Bruker) installed at ITU, Karlsruhe. X-ray wavelength and spot size (at the sample position) were 0.20215 A and 40\(\times\)40 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\), in the synchrotron measurements, and 0.7094 A (MoK\({}_{\alpha_{1}}\)) and 100 \(\times\) 100 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\), for the in-house study. Diffraction images, at ID30, were recorded with a MAR345 image plate detector (3450\(\times\) 3450 pixels of dimensions 100\(\times\) 100 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\)) and, in-house, with a Bruker SMART Apex CCD (1024 \(\times\) 1024 pixels of dimensions 61\(\times\) 61 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\)). DACs were rotated through a sample angle \(\Delta\Omega\) = \(\pm\) 4\({}^{\circ}\) while collecting each diffraction image. Examples of diffraction images recorded for Ce and Pu compounds are shown in Fig. 2. We observe that whereas the Debye Scherrer rings are of homogenous intensity in the case of Ce compounds, in the case of Pu-115 samples the rings are severely "spotty." [In PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) study, due to the longer x-ray wavelength as compared to the synchrotron studies, only ten (_P_4/_mmm_) reflections were accessible.] The "spotiness" is due to grain sizes being larger than those for the Ce-115's, given the approximate equivalence of all sample volumes. We attribute the limiting (large) size to a platelike form of the Pu\(M\)Ga\({}_{5}\) grains (under a high-resolution, optical microscope, we observed that single crystal pieces of Pu\(M\)Ga\({}_{5}\) initially break up, when ground, into platelike crystallites).

The sample to image-plate distance and image-plate non-orthogonality correction were calibrated using powder diffraction data from a Si powder, along with the ESRF software package fitted.[18] This software was also used for

Figure 2: Examples of (area detector) diffraction patterns for Ce (left image) and Pu (right image) 115 compounds. The Ce data are from the CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) run using N\({}_{2}\) (PTM), and the Pu data are from PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) (PTM: oil). Both data sets are representative of the typical data from each family (i.e., smooth rings for Ce-115’s and spotty rings for Pu-115’s), however, the use of a longer x-ray wavelength in PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) study implied that a smaller (total) number of rings was collected.

Figure 1: Experimentally [by high-\(P\) resistivity (Refs. 4 and 12)] determined trends in \(T_{c}(P)\) for CeCoIn\({}_{5}\), CeRhIn\({}_{5}\), PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) (only the smooth “guide-to-the-eye” curves (dotted lines) taken through the data points in Refs. 4 and 12 and not the points themselves are shown). The additional \(y\) scales on the right-hand side (RHS) of each panel give the “anticipated” \(c/a\) ratio, expected if \(T_{c}\) scaled (linearly) with \(c/a\) under pressure. The temperature scales [left-hand side (LHS)] are such that the total range of \(c/a\) is approximately the same for each panel (\(\approx\)0.025).

  integration of diffraction images (intensity summation around each ring) for all samples investigated, providing a data format suitable for structural refinements. These refinements were carried out by profile matching (otherwise known as Le Bail fitting [19]), using the fullprof package.[20] (Note that the spotty diffraction patterns for Pu-115 made Rietveld refinement impossible.) Figure 3 shows examples of the typical fits to diffraction patterns obtained. A notable difference between the patterns for the Ce and Pu compounds is that the intensity of the first Bragg reflection, the (001), is negligible in the case of the Ce-115's. The quality of the fits obtained to the Ce-115 data were, in general, better than those of the Pu for reasons discussed above, concerning powder quality. Bragg (reliability) factors were, in general, ~5% for the Pu work, and for the Ce work, lower still.

The values of the ambient-_P_, unit-cell volume \(V\)0 were, for the Ce-115 compounds, obtained from diffraction patterns from samples at ambient \(P\). However, due to safety issues relating to the risk of (Pu) contamination, it was not possible to do the same for the Pu-115 powders; the samples had to remain "truly encapsulated" (i.e., gasket holes well sealed by diamond anvils) which implied nonambient \(P\) starting conditions [=0.7(1) GPa and 2.5(1) GPa for PuCoGa5 and PuRhGa5, respectively]. The values of \(V\)0 were then "extrapolated" from the _V_(_P_) data at low _P_(<10 GPa) by fitting Birch-Murnaghan curves,[22] with \(V\)0 as a fitting parameter and _B_'0 fixed to a value of 4.

In the analysis of the data for Pu_M_Ga5, only, given the spotty rings, an additional lattice parameter refinement of the \(c\) axis (only) was made using a single diffraction spot in the (001) ring. The 2 _th_ position of the spot as a function of P was determined by Voigt function fitting to its intensity profile (extracted using the CAKE integration option of fit2d). This refinement method is similar to that used in a recent, high-_P_ single-crystal diffraction study to recalibrate the ruby pressure scale.[21]

## III Results

### Bulk compressibilities

The volume compressibility curves for Ce_M_In5 and Pu_M_Ga5 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. For CeCoIn5 [Fig. 4(a)] only one run (open circles) was performed in our studies, using oil as PTM, and the second data-set (open diamonds) is from an ESRF (ID30 beam-line) study by Measson _et al._,[15] which also used oil as PTM and reached 4.2 GPa. The data overlap demonstrates excellent agreement between the two experiments. For CeRhIn5 [Fig. 4(b)] two runs were performed, one using oil (closed circles) and the other using N2 (open circles) as PTM. As usual in experiments employing N2 as PTM, the starting P was relatively high (~2 GPa).

For PuCoGa5 [Fig. 5(a)] an anomaly ("bump") is observed in the volume in the range 10-14 GPa. This is associated to the pressure-induced freezing of the PTM (oil)--see Refs. [23] and [24] for examples of high-_P_ studies where similar effects have been observed. We attribute the preferential presence of this (freezing) anomaly in the experiment on PuCoGa5, as compared to the Ce-115 studies employing the same PTM, to the larger (PuCoGa5) grain sizes and also their platelike form. The presence of the freezing anomaly renders the PuCoGa5 data above 10 GPa to be (quantitatively) unreliable. Given the equivalence of PTM and the form and sizes

Figure 4: Normalized unit-cell volume (_V_/_V_0) as a function of pressure for Ce_M_In5: (a) \(M\) = Co and (b) \(M\) = Rh. In (a) open points (circles and diamonds) distinguish two runs [ours and one performed by Measson _et al._ (Ref. [15]), respectively] which used the same type of PTM (oil). In (b) open points are for a run with N2 as PTM, and closed points are with oil. The solid lines are fits to a Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, with the corresponding \(B\)0 and _B_′0 values given [errors on these values refer to the least significant digit(s)]. Errors on the pressure variable and relative volumes are smaller than the plotting points.

Figure 3: Examples of diffraction patterns (after integration of area detector data) and fits for Ce (left panel) and Pu (right panel) 115 compounds, at various pressure values. The fits (solid lines through data points) are by profile matching. Reflection positions (vertical bars) and difference curves are also shown; the (001) position, for each pattern, is that of lowest 2 _th_ vertical bar. The weak reflection labeled by an asterisk (Ce-115 patterns) is due to excess In flux. The Ce-115 data is from CeRhIn5 with N2 as PTM, and the Pu-115 data is from PuCoGa5 (PTM: oil).

  of the powder grains in both Pu-115 studies, we assume the PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) data [Fig. 5(b)] above 10 GPa to be also unreliable.

The solid lines in Figs. 4 and 5 are fits to a Birch-Murnaghan (BM) form for the equation of state (EOS);[22] the values of \(B_{0}\) and \(B_{0}^{\prime}\) for each compound, obtained from each fit, are given in the figures. The value of \(B_{0}\) obtained for CeCoIn\({}_{5}\) is in good agreement with the value of 78.2(18) GPa reported by Kumar _et al.[6]_ However, for CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) we obtain a \(B_{0}\) value larger than that of 78.4(20) GPa reported by the same authors.[14] The fit for CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) [Fig. 4(a)] takes into account all the points from the N\({}_{2}\) run and (only) the first four points from the oil run. The reason for this is that N\({}_{2}\), in general, provides better hydrostatic conditions than oil. The superior PTM, as well as the reduced scatter in our data compared to those presented in Ref. [14], render our determination of \(B_{0}\) for CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) to be more reliable. The fits for both Pu-115 compounds [Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)] are to the data in the range \(P\!<\!10\) GPa only, given the unreliability of the data above 10 GPa. This explains the deviation, for \(P\)\(>\!10\) GPa, of the data points from the fitted curves in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). The value of \(B_{0}\) obtained for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) is in good agreement with the value of 87 GPa determined in recent density functional electronic structure calculations for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\).[25]

Notwithstanding the relatively low values for the maximum pressure \(P_{\rm max}\) of the data being fitted [\(P_{\rm max}\!<\!0.2B_{0}\) in all cases], the fitted values of \(B_{0}^{\prime}\), being \(\sim\)4 [Figs. 4 and 5(a)], are reasonable (see, for example, Ref. [26] for typical \(B_{0}^{\prime}\) values for actinide intermetallics). For PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) [Fig. 5(b)] the value of \(B_{0}^{\prime}\) has been fixed to the value obtained for PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) [Fig. 5(a)].

### Anomaly in \(c\) lattice parameter in PuMGa\({}_{5}\) associated with freezing of PTM

An inspection of the individual lattice parameters \(a\) and \(c\) in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) as a function of \(P\) reveals that the anomaly in the compressibility curve [Fig. 5(a)] is due to an anomalous behavior in the \(c\) lattice parameter, as shown in Fig. 6(a). In the range 10\(<\!P\!<\!14\) GPa, one observes [Fig. 6(a)] that as the PTM freezes, the \(c\) lattice parameter relaxes. That the anomaly is less pronounced in \(V/V_{0}\) [Fig. 5(a)] is because \(V\) depends more strongly on the \(a\) parameter (\(V\!\propto\!a^{2}\)) than the \(c\)(\(V\!\propto\!c\)), and the former lattice parameter behaves normally as the PTM freezes. A similarly anomalous behavior in the \(c\) parameter (for \(P\!\approx\!10\) GPa) is found in our study on PuRhGa\({}_{5}\).

Whereas the lattice parameters in Fig. 6(a) have been obtained by profile matching of the full diffraction pattern, in Fig. 6(b) the \(P\) dependence of the \(c\) lattice parameter determined from the position of a single diffraction spot in the (001) ring is shown. The insets of Fig. 6(b) show, respectively, the segment of the image plate diffractogram where the spot is located and the (integrated) intensity profile (of the spot) along \(2\theta\). Other diffraction spots comprising the (001) ring were identified, however, only the spot used remained at a fixed position on the image plate throughout the \(P\) range of the experiment. With increasing \(P\), the intensity profile of the spot along \(2\,\theta\) remains a single peak [with a Voigt profile, as in the lower inset of Fig. 6(b)], whereas along the azimuthal direction (i.e., perpendicular to \(2\,\theta\)) the profile, which is initially a single peak, becomes a double peak as the pressure becomes nonhydrostatic (i.e., \(P\)\(>\!10\) GPa). The anomaly in the \(c\) lattice parameter deduced from this analysis is more pronounced than that observed when analyzing the full diffraction pattern [Fig. 6(a)], indicating that the degree of \(c\) parameter relaxation (under the freezing of the PTM) varies between different grains.

### Trends in \(c/a\)

Figure 7(a) shows the trend in \(c/a\) we have determined from our measurements on CeRhIn\({}_{5}\), and in Fig. 7(b) our results are compared to those of Kumar _et al.[14]_ by means of

Figure 6: Normalized lattice parameters \(a_{\rm rel}\) and \(c_{\rm rel}\) in PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) as a function of pressure (the values have been normalized to unity at the starting pressure of 0.7 GPa), showing an anomaly in \(c\) in the range 10–14 GPa due to PTM freezing. The values were obtained by (a) an analysis of the entire diffraction pattern and (b) (\(c\) lattice parameter only) an analysis of a single diffraction spot. The upper inset in (b) shows the relevant “spot” [from the (001) ring] at 0.7 GPa. Here the arrow points in the direction of increasing \(2\theta\); the spot is located just below this arrow. The lower inset shows the profile of the spot along the \(2\,\theta\) direction, fitted to a Voigt function. Errors on lattice parameters in (a) and (b) are smaller than the plotting points.

Figure 5: Normalized unit-cell volume (\(V/V_{0}\)) as a function of pressure for PuMGa\({}_{5}\): (a) \(M\!=\!\)Co and (b) \(M\!=\!\)Rh. In both (a) and (b), the solid lines are Birch-Murnaghan fits made to the data in the range \(P\!<\!10\) GPa. Values of \(B_{0}\) and \(B_{0}^{\prime}\) [with errors to the least significant digit(s)] corresponding to each fit are given [in (b) \(B_{0}^{\prime}\) was fixed]. Errors on the pressure variable and relative volume are smaller than the plotting points.

  replotting the curve (solid line) made through our data points. (Note that this curve, as with our data fitting curves in subsequent figures, is simply a polynomial, "guide-to-the-eye" fit.) We obtain excellent agreement between the _c/a_(_P_) trends obtained using oil and N\({}_{2}\) [Fig. 7(a)], respectively, as PTM. In the \(P\) range 0 to 6 GPa, where the previous study concludes a double peak variation [dashed curve, Fig. 7(b)], we observe _c/a_ to monotonically increase with each pressure increment. The scatter of our data about a smooth curve taken through the points is considerably less than in the case of the Kumar _et al._ study.

Figure 8(a) shows the trend in _c/a_ we have determined for CeCoIn\({}_{5}\). As in Fig. 7, the lower panel [Fig. 8(b)] compares our results (solid line) with the results from the study of Kumar _et al._[6] As in Fig. 4, we plot our data on the same axes as the results of Measson _et al._[15] and observe that the agreement is excellent between the two experiments (_P_\(<\) 4.2 GPa). In Fig. 8(b) we observe "some" qualitative agreement with the Kumar _et al._ study in that, in the range 0\(<\)_P_\(<\) 15 GPa, _c/a_(_P_) is a single-peak function, with peak position between 2.5 and 5 GPa. As in the case of CeRhIn\({}_{5}\), however, our data points are less scattered than for the Kumar _et al._ study.

Figure 9 presents the results for Pu_M_Ga\({}_{5}\). Considering first the case of \(M\) = Co, we observe two distinct trends in _c/a_: a fall with increasing \(P\) up to 10 GPa, followed by a rise with increasing _P_\(>\) 14 GPa. The points in the region 10 \(<\) _P_\(<\) 14 GPa vary strongly with each \(P\) step, which is due to the relaxation effect in the \(c\) parameter [note that we have used lattice parameters determined from the analysis of the full diffraction patterns, Fig. 6(a)]. Given that this effect is an artifact associated with freezing of the PTM, we have not taken into account these points in the curve (solid line) we make through the data points. For PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), we observe _c/a_ to fall with increasing \(P\) (from the starting \(P\) of 2.5 GPa) up to \(P\) \(\approx\) 8 GPa, and then begin to rise. As with the case of PuCoGa\({}_{5}\), the curve (solid line) does not take account of the data between 10 and 14 GPa (maximum \(P\) reached in the experiment) due to the anomalous \(c\) parameter in this \(P\) range.

## IV Discussion

The achievement of hydrostatic pressure has been a goal in all our studies. However, for the case of Pu-115, safety

In (a) the results from a study by Méasson _et al._ (Ref. 15) are also shown (open diamonds; _P_\(<\) 4.2 GPa). The solid line (guide-to-the-eye) curve through our data in (a) is reproduced in (b) (the sizes of _y_-scale ranges are identical in the two panels). The dashed line in (b) is the trend Kumar _et al._ conclude from their data.

Figure 7: _c/a_ as a function of pressure in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\): (a) from this study (circles) and (b) from the Kumar _et al._ study (Ref. 14) (squares). In each panel, closed and open points distinguish data from runs using different PTMs; for our data, closed are for oil and open for N\({}_{2}\). The solid line (guide-to-the-eye) curve through our data in (a) is reproduced in (b) [where it appears “flatter” due to the (4\(\times\)) larger _y_-scale range of the lower panel]. The dashed line curve in (b) is the trend Kumar _et al._ conclude from their data.

Figure 9: _c/a_ as a function of pressure in Pu_M_Ga\({}_{5}\) (_M_ = Co.Rh). The solid line (guide-to-the-eye) curves neglect the points in the range 10 GPa\(<\) _P_\(<\) 14 GPa, for the reason explained in the text.

  issues relating to loading transuranic samples in powder form (unfortunately, high-quality polycrystalline samples were not available) limited our studies to the use of an oil-based PTM. The combination of the freezing of the silicone oil and the large crystallite grain size for Pu-115 (revealed by spotty diffraction images--see Fig. 2) has resulted in our determinations of \(c/a(P)\) being unreliable in the range 10 GPa < \(P\) < 14 GPa. Indeed, the upturn in \(c/a\) for \(P\) > 14 GPa in PuCoGa5 (Fig. 9) may not occur in a situation in which no freezing of the PTM (and resulting relaxation of the \(c\) lattice parameter) occurs. Thus, we may say that our determinations of \(c/a(P)\) for Pu-115 are only (strictly) reliable below 10 GPa.

Our experiments on Ce-115 have not suffered due to the freezing of silicone oil, and we attribute this to a "finer" powder grain size (concomitant with smooth diffraction rings--see Fig. 2) as compared to the Pu-115 powders. In particular, an experiment made on CeRhIn5 using N2 as PTM has shown an identical trend in \(c/a(P)\) as the experiment employing oil [Fig. 7(a)] Comparisons with previous studies on Ce-115 (Kumar _et al._[6, 14] and Measson _et al._[15]) imply the necessity of hydrostatic pressure to achieve the required sensitivity in the determination of \(c/a\) (see Fig. 1), i.e., a sensitivity of less than 1 part in 100 in the relative change in \(c/a\) under \(P\). We may add that in spite of the problems incurred with Pu-115, we still appear to achieve a sensitivity in the determination of \(c/a\) below 10 GPa higher than in the experiments on CeRhIn5 performed by Kumar _et al._[14] [Fig. 7(b)].

Figure 10 gives a comparison of our \(c/a(P)\) trends [only the curves from Figs. 7(a), 8(a), and 9, and not the data points] with the trends which would be expected if \(T_{c}(P)\) scaled linearly with \(c/a\) under high-_P_, i.e., the "anticipated \(c/a\)" (Fig. 1). We plot the results for \(P\) < 10 GPa only, for two reasons. First, for the two Ce-115 compounds, superconductivity does not exist above 10 GPa. Secondly, for the Pu-115's, as stated above, our determination of \(c/a(P)\) is only (strictly) reliable below 10 GPa. None of our measured trends shown in Fig. 10 are found to agree with expectation. We present also in Fig. 10 the \(c/a(P)\) trends determined by the work of Kumar _et al._[6, 14] As with our trends, these previously determined trends do not agree with expectation either.

The small changes in \(c/a\) occurring under high-_P_ in any individual system from our experiments suggest that \(c/a\) is not the main driving parameter for controlling the value of \(T_{c}\) under high \(P\) in these systems (Fig. 10). The remarkable correlation between \(T_{c}\) and \(c/a\) at ambient \(P\) across each 115 family [reported in Ref. 4 for Ce_M\({}_{*}M_{*1}^{\prime}\)_I\({}_{\rm{n}5}\) (_M_,_M_\({}^{\prime}\) =Co,Rh,Ir) and Pu_M_,_M_\({}_{*1}^{\prime}\)_I\({}_{\rm{Ga}5}\) (_M_,_M_\({}^{\prime}\) =Co,Rh)], thus, does not appear to be related to the \(T_{c}(P)\) behavior exhibited in these systems in as simple a way as initially postulated. What is clear is that across the solid solutions, changing the relative concentrations of transition metals \(M\) and _M_\({}^{\prime}\) has two effects: (i) it modifies (slightly) the crystal structure, changing the values of lattice parameters \(a\) and \(c\), and their ratio \(c/a\) and (ii) it alters the value of \(T_{c}\). The former effect is certainly related to a change in radius of the \(M\) atom down the \(d\) group (Co to Ir). The change in \(T_{c}\), however, may also be a consequence of a change in the \(d\) bandwidth [between the 3\(d\) (Co), 4\(d\) (Rh), and 5\(d\) (Ir) bands], in addition to the small changes (~3 and ~1 parts in 100 for the Ce and Pu families, respectively, see Fig. 3 from Ref. 4) in \(c/a\). Recent work on PuCoGa5,[27] for example, has investigated the effect of doping the Co site with a 4 element from a different group of the periodic table (i.e., PuCo,Fe1-,Ga5 and PuCo,Ni1-,Ga5), and observes that both families (in particular PuCo,Fe1-,Ga5) exhibit gradients \(dT_{c}/d(c/a)\), that differ from that for PuCo,Rh1-,Ga5. The effect that pressure has on the hybridization between the Ce (Pu) atoms and the \(M\) and In (Ga) atoms (of the form6\({}^{\prime}\)_fd_ and _fp_, respectively), as well as on other structural parameters [for example,[28] the parameter (\(2zc-a\))/\(a\)], may also relate to why the \(T_{c}(c/a)\) correlation and \(T_{c}(P)\) behavior in Ce (Pu) 115's may not be so simply connected as initially postulated.[4]

## V Conclusions

We have presented results from high-_P_ ADXRD studies on CeCoIn5 and CeRhIn5 (both up to 15 GPa), PuCoGa5 (up to 37 GPa), and PuRhGa5 (up to 14 GPa). The bulk compressibility parameters (_B_0 and \(B\)0') are summarized in Table 1, together with the most reliable measurements of lattice parameters (at ambient _P_) found in the literature. Our value of \(B\)0 for PuCoGa5 is in good agreement with theory,[25] which predicts \(B\)0=87 GPa. (We are unaware of any calculations of \(B\)0 in the literature for CeCoIn5, CeRhIn5, or PuRhGa5.)

In all compounds investigated, the experimentally determined changes in the \(c/a\) ratio do not agree with an expectation that this ratio acts as the main tuning parameter for controlling the value of \(T_{c}\) under pressure. For CeRhIn5, our

Figure 10: Summary of results: experimentally determined trends (solid lines) in \(c/a\) as a function of pressure for all the compounds investigated in this study compared to the _anticipated_ trends from Fig. 1 (dotted lines). For the Ce-115 compounds, the trends in \(c/a(P)\) derived experimentally by Kumar _et al._ (Refs. 14 and 6) are also shown (dashed lines).

  values of \(c/a(P)\) are considerably less scattered than in a study by Kumar _et al._,[14] demonstrating that \(c/a\) increases monotonically with increasing \(P\) from 0 to 6 GPa, rather than exhibiting the double-peak behavior expected. For CeCoIn\({}_{5}\), \(c/a(P)\) is a single-peak function, as expected, but neither the position of the maximum nor the peak amplitude agree with expectation. For both PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\) we observe \(c/a\) to fall with increasing \(P\) up to \(P\) = 8 GPa, rather than to rise to a maximum.[4]

In the case of Pu\(M\)Ga\({}_{5}\), the determination of both \(c/a(P)\) and the bulk-compressibility parameters have been limited to the pressure range \(P\) < 10 GPa due to effects associated with the freezing of oil (PTM). Future work (on Pu\(M\)Ga\({}_{5}\)) employing a better PTM, e.g., such as N\({}_{2}\), should, for safety issues involved in performing DAC loadings of transuranium materials, study samples in single-crystal rather than powder form (high-quality polycrystalline Pu-115 samples are not available). Indeed, the use of single crystals in high-\(P\) XRD is proving pertinent to improved compressibility data due to improved precision in (relative) lattice parameter (as a function of \(P\)) determination as compared to a powder method.[21]

Table 1: Experimentally determined values of lattice parameters \(a_{0}\) and \(c_{0}\) [these are ambient pressure values (Refs. [7], [8], and [10]) and bulk moduli \(B_{0}\) and its pressure derivative \(B_{0}^{\prime}\) (from Birch-Murnaghan equation of state fits to the diffraction data from this study) for certain Ce and Pu-115 compounds. For the Ce-115’s, we show also, in italics, the values of \(B_{0}\) and \(B_{0}^{\prime}\) determined in the experiments of Kumar _et al._ (Refs. [6] and [14]) For PuRhGa\({}_{5}\), our value of \(B_{0}^{\prime}\) has been fixed due to limited diffraction data at low pressure (\(P\) < 10 GPa) collected for this sample. References for the lattice parameter data are as follows: Ref. [7] (CeCoIn\({}_{5}\)), Ref. [8] (CeRhIn\({}_{5}\)), and Ref. [10] (PuCoGa\({}_{5}\) and PuRhGa\({}_{5}\)). Errors on all values refer to least significant digit(s).
