###### Abstract

The appearance of static magnetism, nanoscopically coexisting with
superconductivity, is shown to be a general feature of optimally
electron-doped LFe_(1 − x)Ru_(x)AsO_(1 − y)F_(y) superconductors (L
represents a lanthanide ion) upon isovalent substitution of Fe by Ru.
The magnetic ordering temperature T_(N) and the magnitude of the
internal field display a domelike dependence on x, peaked around x =
1/4, with higher T_(N) values for those materials characterized by a
larger z cell coordinate of As. Remarkably, the latter are also those
with the highest superconducting transition temperatures (T_(c)) for x =
0. The reduction of T_(c)(x) is found to be significant in the x region
of the phase diagram where the static magnetism develops. Upon
increasing the Ru content superconductivity eventually disappears, but
only at x≃ 0.6.

## I Introduction

The proximity of the magnetic and superconducting ground states is a
common aspect of several strongly correlated electron systems, ranging
from the heavy fermions to the organic materials and to the
high-temperature superconductors.[1] Also in the iron-based
materials,[2] superconductivity emerges close to the disruption of a
static magnetic order.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Many studies on the transition
from the magnetic to the superconducting ground state have been carried
out in these materials, either by varying the electron doping or by
applying a high hydrostatic pressure.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15] In several compounds of the LFeAsO_(1 − y)F_(y) family (referred
to as L1111), with L a lanthanide ion, evidence for a nanoscopic
coexistence of the superconducting and magnetic states has emerged,[5,
6, 7, 8] as in other Fe-based compounds.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15] The
stability of these two ground states can be investigated by perturbing
the system with, for example, a chemical substitution. In this respect
the effect of the Ru-for-Fe isovalent diamagnetic substitution is
particularly interesting. In the y = 0 L1111 case this substitution
leads to a progressive dilution of the magnetic lattice[16, 17, 18] and,
eventually, to the disappearance of the magnetic order for x→x_(c)≃ 0.6,
which is considered to be the percolation threshold for the J₁-J₂
localized spin system.[18]

In the optimally F-doped L1111 superconductor, Ru substitution leads to
the progressive reduction of the superconducting transition temperature
T_(c),[19, 20] and to its complete suppression at a Ru concentration
close to x_(c).[21] In optimally F-doped Sm1111, besides diluting the Fe
magnetic lattice, Ru has another remarkable effect: it induces a frozen
short-range (SR) magnetic order which coexists nanoscopically with
superconductivity, albeit with reduced T_(c) values.[21]

In this work we show that the appearance of static SR magnetic order,
nanoscopically coexisting with superconductivity, is a common feature of
Ru-doped LFe_(1 − x)Ru_(x)AsO_(1 − y)F_(y) (hereafter L11Ru11) with L =
Sm, Nd, or La, and with a F content close to optimal doping. The
magnetic dome is peaked around the Ru concentration x = 1/4 and its
extension increases upon decreasing the size of the L ion (since the
latter is correlated with the cell coordinate of As, $z_{\rm As}$,
hereafter different L ions will also be identified by their z values).
On the other hand, the superconducting transition temperature T_(c)
drops at low Ru content, more abruptly for L = Sm and Nd and only
marginally for La, at the same Ru content that marks the appearance of
the static SR magnetic order at T_(N).

## II Experimental details

To investigate the influence of Ru substitution on the magnetic and
superconducting properties of LFe_(1 − x)Ru_(x)AsO_(1 − y)F_(y), zero-
(ZF) and longitudinal-field (LF) muon-spin spectroscopy (μSR)
experiments were performed in powder samples with L = La, Nd, prepared
as reported in Ref. [20]. The μSR experiments were performed at the Paul
Scherrer Institute on the GPS and DOLLY spectrometers. ZF experiments
can detect the presence of spontaneous magnetic ordering, in the case of
short-range order also.[7, 22] LF experiments, instead, reveal the
static or dynamic nature of the magnetic state.[22] All the samples were
optimally electron doped with a nominal F content y = 0.15 and 0.11 for
L = Sm and for L = La, Nd respectively. Here we compare the L = La and
Nd cases with our published Sm data.[21] The three families display
T_(c) = 28, 47, and 52 K for x = 0, respectively.

## III Results

### Detection of static magnetic order

For each one of the L families under investigation, a few representative
time-dependent ZF μSR asymmetries curves are shown in the left panels of
Fig. 1, together with the best fit to the sum of a longitudinal and a
transverse component as

$$\frac{A_{ZF}(t)}{a_{ZF}}=\sum_{i=1,2}(w_{L_{i}}e^{-\lambda_{i}t}+w_{T}e^{-\sigma_{ i}^{2}t^{2}/2}),$$
(1)

where ∑_(i)(w_(L_(i)) + w_(T)) = 1, a_(ZF) is the total muon signal
amplitude, calibrated at high temperature in the paramagnetic phase,
w_(L) and w_(T) are the weights of the transverse and longitudinal
terms, respectively, and λ and σ are the corresponding decay rates. The
transverse term is an overdamped precession, due to the static mean
internal field $\overline{B}$ which is comparable to the square root of
the second moment, Δ B = σ/γ (with γ/2π = 135.5 MHz/T the muon
gyromagnetic ratio). Indeed, LF measurements show that for all the L
families an external field of the order of Δ B is sufficient to quench
the transverse relaxation, revealing the static character of the
magnetic state. The subscript i = 1, 2, when applicable, accounts for
the two known muon stopping sites in L1111 compounds,[23, 24, 25] one
from within the FeAs layers and the other close to O²⁻ ions. The two
longitudinal components w_(L_(i)) are well resolved only for L= Sm, as
for the nonmagnetic Sm1111 case.[26]

The magnitude of the internal magnetic fields B_(i) at the muon site
[≃Δ B_(i) shown in Fig. 1(e)] is the sum of the fields generated by the
static moments surrounding the muon site, which depend on the
distribution of Fe and Ru atoms at the neighboring sites. Notice that
the fast decay of the transverse component starts well above the L (Sm
or Nd) ordering temperature; hence it must be related to the static Fe
moments. At T → 0 K the mean value of the internal fields for L= Sm is
about 40 mT, while it decreases to ∼20 mT for L= La and Nd. These are
the typical values measured in F-doped L1111 compounds close to the
crossover between the magnetic and superconducting phases, of L= Sm and
Ce^(5, 27) and La.[10, 24]

For polycrystals, the volume fraction in which muons experience a net
internal field can be calculated as
$V_{\rm mag}=3\sum_{i}w_{T_{i}}/2=3(1-\sum_{i}w_{L_{i}})/2$.[5, 27] The
ordering temperatures T_(N) plotted in Fig. 2(b) are determined from the
condition $V_{\rm mag}(T_{N})=0.5$. Figure 1(d) shows that
$V_{\rm mag}=1$ at low temperature for all the three L11Ru11 compounds.
It is important to notice that the estimated dipolar field distribution

of width Δ B₁ implies a distribution of distances 0.1 ≲ r ≲ 2 nm between
the muon and the closest frozen Fe moment.[5]

### The three-dimensional phase diagram

Our main result is displayed in Fig. 2. The top panel shows the behavior
of the superconducting transition temperature T_(c) for the three
L11Ru11 families, as determined by dc superconducting quantum
interference device magnetization measurements (see Refs. [20] and
[21]). The bottom panel reports the corresponding magnetic ordering
temperatures, from μSR. A remarkable feature is the rather pronounced
suppression of T_(c) for L= Sm and Nd at x ≃ 0.10 and 0.20,
respectively. As already shown[21] for L= Sm this concentration
coincides with the onset of static SR magnetic order (see Fig. 2, bottom
panel). A very similar behavior is observed also in case of L= Nd at
x ≃ 0.2. T_(c) vanishes for _all_ the families around x → 0.6, which
corresponds to the magnetic percolation threshold x_(c) for the magnetic
lattice in the undoped La1111.[18]

In addition it is interesting to note that, despite the low density of
L= Nd points, both the La and Sm data give evidence that the maximum of
T_(N) is peaked around x = 0.25. In the bottom panel of Fig. 2 this
indication is very sharp for L= La. For L= Sm, although asymmetric,
T_(N) has again a maximum around x = 0.25.

### Nanoscopic coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity

We found that $V_{\rm mag}$ is close to unity below T_(N) for all the
magnetic samples with nonzero T_(N). This implies that in the absence of
an applied field all ZF-implanted muons detect the presence of an
ordered magnetic moment, i.e., internal fields develop throughout the
whole sample (although some muons detect these fields from just outside
a magnetic region, not farther than a few nanometers). Since dc
magnetometry measurements detect a sizable superconducting fraction,[20,
21] following the same arguments used in Refs. [21] and [27], it is
conceivable that in all these families magnetic and superconducting
regions form an interspersed texture, owing to the nanoscopic electronic
inhomogeneities induced by the Ru distribution.

However, superconductivity may survive in such finely dispersed regions
only as long as its coherence length ξ is comparable to the average
separation r (a few nanometers) among magnetic domains. In order to
roughly estimate the coherence length ξ_(x) as a function of Ru content
x, the upper critical field H_(c2)(T, x) ∝ ξ_(x)⁻² was derived[28] for
L= La. The data for L= Sm are taken from Ref. [19]. The value of H_(c2)
for T → 0 was estimated from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg
relation[29]

H_(c2) ≃ 0.7T_(c)(H = 0)|dH_(c2)/dT|_(T, (x, H = 0)).
(2)

Although this expression tends to overestimate[30]H_(c2)(0, x), it can
still provide the relative variation of the upper critical field with Ru
substitution. The results are shown in Fig. 3 for L= La (solid circles)
and Sm (solid triangles). One can then derive ξ_(x) and find that
ξ_(0.25)/ξ₀ is 1.3 and 2.4 for La and Sm, respectively. Hence, from the
absolute values of ξ₀ reported in Ref. [28], one estimates an absolute
value ξ_(0.25) ≈ 3 nm for both L ions, namely, the same order of
magnitude as the mean distance r among magnetic domains. Thus, the
observation of bulk superconductivity does not conflict with muons
detecting $V_{\rm mag}=1$ [Fig. 1(d)].

The nanoscopic coexistence of the two phases in L11Ru11 is reminiscent
of that observed at the crossover between magnetic and superconducting
order in F-doped Sm1111 (Refs. [5] and [6]) and Ce1111 (Ref. [27]), but
notably not in La1111. In the latter the two order parameters are
mutually exclusive at ambient pressure[4] and are observed to coexist in
mesoscopically separated regions under both external[10] and
chemical[31] pressures. Here, the detection of nanoscopic coexistence
not only in Sm11Ru11 and Nd11Ru11, but also in La11Ru111, suggests that
the substitution for Fe of the isovalent nonmagnetic Ru induces a static
SR magnetic order.

## IV Discussion

Our results show that the static SR magnetic order induced by the
isovalent and nonmagnetic Ru substitution around x = 1/4 is a common
aspect of LFe_(1 − x)Ru_(x)AsO_(1 − x)F_(x) optimally F-doped
superconductors. A possible mechanism which explains the observed
suppression of T_(c) and the appearance of a static SR magnetic order is
the electron localization arising from Ru impurity scattering. This
localizing effect is well known to suppress the superconducting
transition temperature.[32] In addition, due to the loss of the kinetic
energy of the electrons, which becomes significant as the temperature
decreases, electron localization may induce local magnetic moments on
the Fe ions which eventually freeze below T_(N).

The above idea is supported by the x dependence of the residual
resistivity $\rho_{\rm res}$, which for all L= La, Nd (Ref. [20]), and
Sm (Ref. [19]) compounds displays a behavior analogous to that of
T_(N)(x), as shown in Fig. 4. This domelike trend indicates a
competition between the electron localization and the increase in
kinetic energy caused by the more extended Ru d orbitals. Interestingly,
at least for Sm and Nd, the maximum of the residual resistivity is close
to x = 1/4 where T_(N)(x) is peaked. Moreover, a direct comparison with
Fig. 2 indicates that the magnetic state can develop only for those
samples

scale) and H_(c2)(T → 0) (closed symbols, right scale) vs Ru content x

the eye.

with $\rho_{\rm res}\gtrsim\rho_{c}=1.5$ mΩ cm (emphasized by the dotted
line), which is quite reasonable as a crossover value for Anderson
localization.[33]

In a slightly different scenario, one can consider that the perturbation
generated by Ru impurities yields a staggered polarization of the
magnetic moments present on the surrounding Fe sites. This hypothesis is
based on the experimental evidence for the existence of a sizable,
rapidly fluctuating, magnetic moment at the Fe site in different
optimally doped Fe-based superconductors.[34; 35] Thus one could expect
that when these moments freeze, a static SR order appears, characterized
by antiferromagnetic correlations. This SR order is analogous to that
observed in the underdoped L= Sm,Ce (Refs. [5; 27]) and L= La (Ref.
[10]) compounds close to the crossover between magnetic and
superconducting phases. In fact, the μSR spectra shown in Fig. 1 at
x ≃ 1/4 are very similar to those measured at that crossover.
Specifically, no oscillations are observed in the time spectra and the
depolarization rates of the transverse fractions measured here for
T → 0, when L= Sm or La, are similar to those of the F-doped L1111
compounds close to the crossover between magnetic and superconducting
phases, namely, σ₁ is about 60 μs⁻¹ (Ref. [9]) and 20 μs⁻¹ (Ref. [14]),
respectively.

We notice that the appearance of static magnetism (around x = 0.1, L=
Sm, and x = 0.2, L= Nd; arrows in the top and bottom panels of Fig. 2)
is concomitant with a marked change of the derivative dT_(c)(x)/dx.
Figure 3 shows that the critical field H_(c2)(x) generally follows the
same trend as T_(c)(x) for both Sm and La, with the notable exception of
the x ≃ 0.25 compositions, where T_(c) is more drastically depressed in
both families. The effect is more sizable when the SR magnetic order is
stronger (L = Sm, Fig. 2). The comparison of Sm and La at x = 0.1
indicates that the onset of magnetic order in Sm11Ru11 disperses T_(c)
well below the value of the corresponding La11Ru11, where the static SR
magnetic order is absent. This behavior indicates that the _static_
magnetism and superconductivity in 1111 compounds do strongly compete.
In other words, T_(c) seems to be reduced by the renormalization of the
spectrum of the spin fluctuations, induced by the onset of the static SR
order, suggesting that superconductivity is driven by a spin fluctuation
mechanism. This observation appears to be in agreement with recent
point-contact Andreev-reflection measurements[36] performed on the same
set of Sm11Ru11 samples, which indicate a progressive decrease of the
boson energy when static magnetism appears.

The static magnetic order is more extended and accompanied by larger
internal fields ΔB₁ in those compounds where the superconducting T_(c)
for the Ru free x = 0 composition is higher. Indeed, both ΔB₁ and T_(c)
increase from La to Sm, together with the z cell coordinate of As.[37;
38] the oblique axis in Fig. 2, which is only slightly Ru dependent.[19;
39] This trend is in agreement with the Landau free-energy derivation,
based on density functional calculations in the local density
approximation, showing that the magnetic ground state in L1111 compounds
gets progressively more stable as z increases.[40] The same calculations
suggest that the $z_{\rm As}$ coordinate may effectively tune the
approach to a quantum tricritical point where an enhancement of the
superconducting pairing may occur.

On the other hand, it should be pointed out that the strong competition
between the superconductivity and the static SR magnetic order can be
understood even when the pairing mechanism is not related to the spin
fluctuations. Actually, the s_(±) symmetry expected in the case of a
spin fluctuation mechanism can hardly explain the very small initial
T_(c) suppression rate |dT_(c)/dx|_(x = 0) observed in these
systems,[41; 42; 43] unless the intraband impurity scattering is much
larger than the interband one.[44; 45; 46] On this point, it is worth
mentioning that theories which predict a possible role of the orbital
fluctuations[47; 48; 49] predict an s₊₊ symmetry of the order parameter,
which can explain the small values of |dT_(c)/dx|_(x → 0) observed here.

## V Conclusion

In conclusion, the phase diagram of Ru-doped LFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(y) with an
optimum value of y was outlined for different L ions. It was shown that
the appearance of static magnetism induced by the nonmagnetic isovalent
Ru substitution around x = 1/4 is a common aspect of
LFe_(1 − x)Ru_(x)AsO_(1 − y)F_(y) optimally F-doped superconductors. The
onset of the magnetism is concomitant with a sizable weakening of the
superconducting state in the x region where the residual resistivity
shows a peak, namely, where the effects of the electron localization are
most significant. The stronger the static magnetism induced by Ru
substitution, the more significant is the degradation of the
superconducting state, which is definitely suppressed only for
x → x_(c) ≃ 0.6. In addition, it was shown that the magnitude of the
transition temperature T_(N) and the x extension of the magnetic phase
appear to progressively vanish as one moves in the x-$z_{\rm As}$ plane
towards lower $z_{\rm As}$ values while x is kept at ∼1/4. These results
were discussed in the framework of different superconducting pairing
mechanisms.
