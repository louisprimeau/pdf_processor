###### Abstract

The structure of the layered transition-metal borides AB_{2} (A= Os, Ru) is built up by alternating T and B layers with the B layers forming a puckered honeycomb. Here we report superconducting properties of RuB_{2} with a T_{c}\approx 1.5 K using measurements of the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature T, magnetization M versus magnetic field H, resistivity versus T, and heat capacity versus T at various H. We observe a reduced heat capacity anomaly at T_{c} given by \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}\approx 1.1 suggesting multigap superconductivity. Strong support for this is obtained by the successful fitting of the electronic specific heat data to a two-gap model with gap values \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.88 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.13. Additionally, M versus H measurements reveal a behavior consistent with type-I superconductivity. This is confirmed by comparing the experimental critical field \approx122 Oe obtained from extrapolation to T=0 of the H-T phase diagram, with an estimate of the T=0 thermodynamic critical field \approx114 Oe. Additionally, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter was estimated to be \kappa\approx 0.1-0.66. These results strongly suggest multigap type-I superconductivity in RuB_{2}. We also calculate the band structure and obtain the Fermi surface for RuB_{2}. The Fermi surface consists of one quasi-two-dimensional sheet and two concentric ellipsoidal sheets very similar to OsB_{2}. An additional small fourth sheet is also found for RuB_{2}. RuB_{2} could thus be an example of a multigap type-I superconductor.

## 1 Introduction

The discovery of multigap superconductivity in MgB_{2}[1, 2] has led to a revival of interest and activity in the search for similar behavior in other superconductors. There are now several accepted candidate multigap superconductors such as NbSe_{2}[3], RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R= Lu and Y) [4], Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}[5, 6], Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[7], and more recently FeSe [8, 9]. Multigap superconductors are associated with several anomalous superconducting properties, for example, a reduced heat capacity jump at the superconducting critical temperature \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}, a non-BCS temperature dependence of the upper critical field, and a non-BCS penetration depth versus temperature. These anomalous properties are mostly connected with Fermi surface sheets with very different characters. This is exemplified most clearly in the case of MgB_{2}[10, 11, 12, 13].

Recently OsB_{2}, which has a layered structure with puckered honeycomb boron planes alternating with osmium planes stacked along the c axis of an orthorhombic cell, has been studied for its superhardness as well as for its superconducting properties. Several anomalous superconducting properties like upward curvature in the H_{c}(T) curve, reduced heat capacity anomaly at T_{c}, non-BCS temperature dependence of the penetration depth, small Ginzburg-Landau parameters \kappa\sim 1-2, and a first-order superconducting transition in a magnetic field have been observed for OsB_{2}[14, 15]. These properties were interpreted as signatures of two-gap superconductivity. A fit by a two-gap model to the T dependent penetration depth data gave the values \Delta_{1}\approx 1.25k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}\approx 1.9k_{B}T_{c} for the two gaps, respectively [15]. The Fermi surface of OsB_{2} consists of a quasi-two-dimensional sheet and two concentric ellipsoidal sheets [16]. The two gaps were argued to open on the two ellipsoidal Fermi surface sheets which are very similar in character and size [15], unlike the two gaps in MgB_{2} which open on two Fermi sheets which are very different in character [13].

However, an alternate view has recently been put forward for these anomalous properties of OsB_{2} with proposal of extreme type-I superconductivity (very small \kappa) and a single but highly anisotropic gap [17].

RuB_{2} is isostructural to OsB_{2} and is also reported to become superconducting below T_{c}\approx 1.5 K [18]. Although its normal state properties have been studied in detail [14], the superconducting properties have not been explored. Given the anomalous superconducting properties of OsB_{2}, it would be interesting to make a detailed study of the superconducting properties of RuB_{2} to look for similar anomalous properties. In this work we report the superconducting properties of polycrystalline samples of RuB_{2}. We confirm that RuB_{2} exhibits bulk superconductivity below a critical temperature T_{c}=1.5 K. The magnetization versus magnetic field data suggest type-I superconductivity. We estimate an electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{ep}=0.39-0.45 suggesting moderate coupling superconductivity in RuB_{2}. The extrapolated T=0 critical field H_{c}(0)\approx 122 Oe is small and consistent with type-I superconductivity. The normalized heat capacity jump at T_{c} was estimated to be \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}\approx 1.1, which is much smaller than the value 1.43 expected for a single-gap s-wave BCS superconductor and suggests multigap superconductivity. This is confirmed by obtaining an excellent fit of the electronic specific heat data below T_{c} to a phenomenological two-gap model. The fit gave the gap values \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.88 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.13 for the two gaps. The jump in the heat capacity at T_{c} becomes larger in applied magnetic fields again suggesting type-I behavior. These suggestions are confirmed by estimates of the Ginzburg Landau parameter \kappa=0.1-0.6, which is smaller than the value 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707, the border between type-I and type-II superconductivity. Thus RuB_{2} could be a rare example of a multigap type-I superconductor. Additionally, we calculate the band structure and obtain the Fermi surface of RuB_{2}. The band structure confirms metallic behavior with majority contribution to the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy (\epsilon_{F}) coming from Ru 4d and B 2p orbitals. We calculate the total DOS for both spin directions \epsilon_{F}=1.17 states/eV f.u., where "f.u." stands for "formula unit." This value is similar to the value reported for OsB_{2}[14]. The Fermi surface consists of four sheets. There is one quasi-two-dimensional corrugated tubular sheet and two concentric ellipsoidal sheets, very similar to OsB_{2}[14]. An additional small fourth sheet is found which was not obtained for OsB_{2}.

## II Experimental and theoretical methods

Polycrystalline samples of RuB_{2} were synthesized by arc-melting stoichiometric ratios of Ru (5N, Alfa Aesar) and B (6N, Alfa Aesar) 5-10 times to promote homogeneity [14]. Powder x-ray diffraction confirmed that the synthesized material is single phase and a refinement of the powder pattern gave lattice parameters which match well with the reported values [14]. The dc magnetic susceptibility \chi versus temperature data in the temperature T range T=0.280 K to 2 K and magnetization M versus field H data at T=310 mK were measured using a He3 insert in a SQUID magnetometer from Cryogenics Limited, UK. The heat capacity C data from 85 mK to 3 K was measured using the dilution refrigerator (DR) option of a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (QD-PPMS). The electrical transport from 300 mK to 300 K was measured using the He3 insert in a QD-PPMS. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were done using the quantum-expresso code [19]. Electronic exchange and correlation are described using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using Perdew-Bruke-Ernzerhof functional [20]. In the DFT calculation, spin-orbit coupling was not included. However, we have used scalar relativistic potential which takes scalar relativistic effects into account.

## III Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivity \rho versus temperature T data for RuB_{2} measured with an excitation current of 5 mA in zero applied magnetic field are shown in Fig. 1 between T=0.5 K and 315 K. The T=315 K value of resistivity is \rho(315 K) \approx 22.5\mu\Omega cm and the residual resistivity is \rho(1.6 K) \approx 1.1\mu\Omega cm giving a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) \approx 21. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the \rho(T) data below T=5.25 K to highlight the sharp drop to zero resistance below T_{c}=1.5 K signaling the onset of superconductivity in RuB_{2}.

## IV Magnetic properties

Figure 2 shows the results of magnetic measurements on RuB_{2}. Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) volume magnetic susceptibility \chi_{v} normalized by 1/4\pi. The data were measured in a field of 10 Oe between 0.28 K and 1.8 K. The sharp drop in \chi_{v} to diamagnetic values below \approx 1.55 K confirms the onset of the superconducting state. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows the d\chi_{v}/dT vs T data and the peak position is taken as the superconducting critical temperature T_{c}=1.5 K. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak in d\chi_{v}/dT gives an estimate of the superconducting transition width and is \approx50 mK. The \chi_{v} data have not been corrected for the demagnetization factor N. Thus the observed value is 4\pi\,\chi_{v}=\frac{1}{1-N} and therefore larger than -1 expected for 100\% superconducting volume fraction. Assuming 100\% superconducting volume fraction we estimate N\approx 0.32 from the data shown in Fig. 2(a). However, often in polycrystalline samples the superconducting fraction is smaller than 100\% and to estimate the actual superconducting fraction one needs the value of N. For idealized shapes of samples, N has been calculated. For example, N=1/3 for a sphere and 1 for an ellipsoid of revolution. Our sample is an irregular shaped piece broken from an arc-melted button and looks like a squashed ellipsoid with dimensions a\approx b=1.61 mm \neq c=1.35 mm. We therefore approximate our irregular shaped sample with a prolate ellipsoid with c/a\approx 0.83. For such an object, N\approx 0.38[21]. Using this value of N we find a superconducting volume fraction of \approx 90\%.

Figure 2(b) shows the volume magnetization M_{v} normalized by 1/4\pi versus magnetic field H for RuB_{2} measured at a temperature T=310 mK, well inside the superconducting state. The shape of the 4\pi\,M_{v} vs H data are very different from those expected for typical type-II superconductors but are similar to that expected for a type-I superconductor with demagnetization factors. To account for demagnetization effects the magnetization can be plotted versus an effective magnetic field H_{\rm eff}=H-NM. This has been done using the N\approx 0.38 estimated above and the resulting M(H_{\rm eff}) data are shown in Fig. 2(b), inset. These data look like the behavior expected for a type-I superconductor. The slight negative slope of the data at the transition most likely occurs from a slightly overestimated N.

Figure 1: Electrical resistivity \rho vs temperature T for RuB_{2} measured in zero magnetic field between T=0.4 and 310 K. The inset shows the data below T=5.5 K to highlight the abrupt drop at T_{c}=1.5 K signaling the transition to the superconducting state.

  

## V Heat Capacity

Figure 3(a) shows the specific heat C versus T data for RuB_{2} measured between T=85 mK and 3 K in magnetic fields H=0 Oe and H=250 Oe. A sharp anomaly near T_{c}=1.5 K in the H=0 data confirms bulk superconductivity in RuB_{2}. The data at H=250 Oe doesn't show any signature of superconductivity and will be used as the normal state data. We will later show that this field is indeed much higher than the estimated critical field. The C(T) data at H=250 Oe were fit by the expression C=\gamma_{n}T+\beta T^{3} where \gamma_{n} is the normal state Sommerfeld coefficient and the second term is the contribution from the lattice. The fit shown as the solid curve through the H=250 Oe data in Fig. 3(a) gave the values \gamma_{n}=1.65(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta=0.014(2) mJ/mol K^{4}.

(b) The electronic specific heat divided by temperature C_{d}/T vs T for RuB_{2}. An equal entropy construction is shown to give a T_{c}=1.46 K and \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}=1.1, where \gamma=\gamma_{n}-\gamma_{\rm res}. (c) A two-gap model fit (solid curve) to the C_{d} data and expectation for a single BCS gap (dash-dot curve) (see text for details).

Figure 2: (a) Temperature T dependence of the zero field cooled (ZFC) dimensionless volume susceptibility \chi_{v} in terms of the superconducting volume fraction 4\pi\,\chi_{v} of RuB_{2} measured in a magnetic field H=10 Oe. At low T, the 4\pi\,\chi_{v} values are more negative than -1 due to demagnetization effects. The inset shows the d\chi/dT vs T data to highlight the superconducting transition at T_{c}=1.5 K. (b) The volume magnetization M_{n} normalized by 1/4\pi vs applied magnetic field H measured at T=310 mK. The inset shows the 4\pi\,M_{V} vs effective magnetic field H_{\rm eff}=H-NM corrected for the demagnetization effects. These data show behavior typical of type-I superconductivity.

 This value of \beta gives a Debye temperature of \theta_{D}=720(30) K which is similar to the value found previously [15]. The lattice contribution \beta T^{3} to the total specific heat C(T) can be subtracted to get the electronic contribution C_{el}(T). The C_{el}(T) so obtained is shown in Fig. 3(b). The sharp anomaly at T_{c} as well as the exponential fall at the lowest temperatures expected for s-wave superconductors is clearly visible. We also note that C_{el} tends to a finite value as T\to 0 suggesting some nonsuperconducting fraction in the sample. The data below \approx 0.3 K were fit by the expression C_{el}/T=\gamma_{\text{res}}+(A/T)\text{exp}(-\Delta/T), where \gamma_{\text{res}} is the residual Sommerfeld coefficient from the nonsuperconducting fraction of the sample and the second term is a phenomenological exponential decay expected for a gapped system. The fit shown as the solid curve through the data below T\approx 0.3 K in Fig. 3(b) gives the value \gamma_{\text{res}}=0.36 mJ/mol K^{2}. With the total \gamma_{n}=1.65 mJ/mol K^{2} and the residual nonsuperconducting \gamma_{\text{res}}=0.36 mJ/mol K^{2}, the superconducting contribution becomes \gamma_{s}=1.29 mJ/mol K^{2}. This suggests that \approx22% of the sample volume is nonsuperconducting.

We can now analyze the specific heat jump height at T_{c}. The jump \Delta C at T_{c} is normalized as \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}, where \gamma is the Sommerfeld coefficient of the superconducting part. The superconducting transition can be broadened and the jump height suppressed in real materials due to a distribution of T_{c} arising from sample inhomogeneities or disorder. To get a better estimate of \Delta C and T_{c} we use an entropy-conserving construction. In such a construction the C_{el} data just below the maximum of the anomaly is fit by a polynomial and extrapolated to higher temperatures. The entropy is then evaluated and equated to the normal state entropy \gamma_{n}T_{c}. Such a construction gave the jump height \Delta C/T_{c}=3.07-1.65=1.42 mJ/mol K^{2} and T_{c}=1.46 K as shown in Fig. 3(b). The T_{c} found by this entropy-conserving construction is quite close to the onset temperature 1.5 K indicating the sharp transition and suggesting a very good sample quality with very little disorder and inhomogeneities. Using the above \Delta C/T_{c}=1.42 mJ/mol K^{2} and the superconducting contribution \gamma_{s}=1.29 mJ/mol K^{2} we estimate \Delta C/\gamma_{s}T_{c}=1.44/1.29\approx 1.12. This value is much smaller than the value 1.43 expected for a single-gap s-wave superconductor. The reduced value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} is similar to observations for MgB_{2}[10] and OsB_{2}[14; 15] and suggests multigap superconductivity.

To confirm this possibility we have attempted to fit our C_{el}(T) data below T_{c} to a phenomenological two-gap model as has been reported for example for MgB_{2}[22]. The T=0 value of the two superconducting gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2}, the critical temperature T_{c}, and the fractional contribution of the first band x were the three fit parameters. An excellent fit, shown in Fig. 3(c) as the solid curve through the C_{el}/T data below T_{c}, was obtained with the fit parameters \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.88, \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.13, T_{c}\approx 1.47 K, and x=0.58. If we compare the values of the two gaps we estimate above to the single band BCS value \Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=1.76 we see that our values agree with the theorem that for a two-gap superconductor one of the gaps will always be larger than the BCS value while the second gap will always be smaller [23]. For comparison, we also show in Fig. 3(c) the simulated data for a superconductor with a single BCS gap with T_{c}=1.47 K which clearly doesn't match the data. Thus the heat capacity data in Fig. 3 strongly indicate that RuB_{2} could be a two-gap superconductor.

Figure 4(a) shows the specific heat C versus T data for RuB_{2} measured between T=85 mK and 3.5 K at various applied magnetic fields H. All data were measured by cooling in zero field to the lowest temperature and then measuring while warming up in the desired magnetic field. As expected, the SC transition is pushed to lower temperatures in increasing fields and is not observed down to the lowest temperature for fields H\geqslant 150 Oe. The specific heat divided by temperature C/T versus T at various magnetic fields is plotted in Fig. 4(b). From Fig. 4(b) we observe that the magnitude of the peak at T_{c} initially increases in a magnetic field. In a magnetic field the transition for a type-I superconductor becomes first order. Thus one should in principle observe a diverging anomaly at T_{c}. In real materials, however, the anomaly is broadened due to sample inhomogeneity and as a consequence the anomaly looks like a jump larger than that in zero field. Thus the observed behavior in Fig. 4(b) also points to type-I superconductivity in RuB_{2}. This is similar to what was observed for OsB_{2}[15] and for other type-I superconductors like ScGa_{3} and LaGa_{3}[24; 25] and YbSb_{2}[26]. This is consistent with the magnetization data of Fig. 2(b), inset, which also suggest type-I superconductivity.

The above value of \gamma can be used to estimate the density of states at the Fermi energy (\epsilon_{F}) for both spin directions N(\epsilon_{F}) by using the expression \gamma=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}k_{B}^{2}N(\epsilon_{F}). Using \gamma=1.65 mJ/mol K^{2} we obtain N(\epsilon_{F})\approx 1.40 states/eV f.u. We

  will compare this value with estimations from band structure calculations later.

## VI Superconducting parameters

The C(T,H) data presented above were used to extract the critical temperature at various magnetic fields. The critical field H_{c} versus T data thus obtained is shown in Fig. 5. The data were fit by the phenomenological expression H_{c}(T)=H_{c}(0)[1-(\frac{T}{T_{c}})^{2}] with H_{c}(0) and T_{c} as fitting parameters, where H_{c}(0) is the zero temperature critical field. The fit, shown as the solid curve through the data in Fig. 5, extrapolated to T=0 gave the values H_{c}(0)=122 Oe and T_{c}=1.48 K. The satisfactory fit to the above expression suggests BCS superconductivity in RuB_{2}.

An estimate for the T dependent thermodynamic critical field H_{tc}(T) can be made from the electronic heat capacity data C_{el}(T) using the expression [\mu_{0}H_{tc}(T)]^{2}/2=F_{en}-F_{es}=-\gamma(T^{2}+T_{c}^{2})/2+\int_{T^{c}}^ {T_{c}}C_{el}(T)dT+T\int_{0}^{T}\frac{C_{el}(T)}{T}dT, where F_{en} and F_{es} are the electronic free energy in the normal and superconducting state, respectively [27]. In particular, the T=0 thermodynamic critical field H_{tc}(0) can be estimated by inserting T=0 in the above expression giving (\mu_{0}H_{tc}(0))^{2}/2=-\gamma\,T_{c}^{2}/2+\int_{0}^{T}C_{el}(T)dT. Using \gamma_{s}=1.3 mJ mol K^{2} and T_{c}=1.46 K obtained from an equal entropy construction above, we estimate the T=0 thermodynamic critical field H_{tc}(0)\approx 114 Oe. This is slightly smaller but close to the estimate 122 Oe made from the H-T phase diagram and suggests type-I superconductivity in RuB_{2}. This is supported by estimates of the Ginzburg Landau parameter below. For comparison with the experimental H-T diagram obtained from C(T,H) data, the H_{tc}(T) estimated by using the above expression are also shown in Fig. 5.

The electron-phonon coupling \lambda_{\rm ep} can be estimated using McMillan's formula [28], which relates the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} to \lambda_{\rm ep}, the Debye temperature \theta_{D}, and the Coulumb pseudopotential \mu^{*}. This formula can be inverted to get \lambda_{\rm ep} in terms of the other parameters,

\[\lambda_{\rm ep}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\text{ln}\big{(}\frac{\theta_{D}}{1.4S_{T} }\big{)}}{(1-0.62\mu^{*})\text{ln}\big{(}\frac{\theta_{D}}{1.4S_{T}}\big{)}-1. 04}.\]

Using, \theta_{D}=700 K obtained from heat capacity measurements above and using T_{c}=1.5 K, we get \lambda_{\rm ep}=0.37 and 0.45 for \mu^{*}=0.1 and 0.15, respectively. These values are slightly smaller than values obtained for OsB_{2}[14] consistent with a slightly smaller T_{c} compared to OsB_{2}. These values of \lambda_{\rm ep} are consistent with previous theoretical values [29] and suggest moderate-coupling superconductivity in RuB_{2}. The corresponding value for MgB_{2} is \lambda_{\rm ep}\approx 1[30].

We now estimate the T=0 values of the penetration depth \lambda(0) and coherence length \xi(0). RuB_{2} has two formulas units per unit cell. This means that there are four electrons in one unit cell volume V=53.84 A^{3}. Therefore, the electron density is n=4/V=7.4\times 10^{-2} A^{-3}. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, we can use the above value of n to estimate the Fermi wave vector k_{F}=(3n\pi^{2})^{1/3}=1.3 A^{-1}. The London penetration depth is given by \lambda(0)=(m^{*}/\mu_{0}ne^{2})^{1/2}, where we take the effective mass m^{*} as the free electron mass m_{e}. Putting in values gives us \lambda(0)\approx 47 nm. The BCS coherence length can be estimated using the expression \xi=\frac{0.18\xi^{2}k_{F}}{k_{B}T,m^{*}}\approx 0.45\mum. The Ginzburg Landau (GL) parameter can now be estimated as \kappa=0.96\lambda(0)/\xi\approx 0.1 which is much smaller than the value 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707 separating type-I and type-II superconductivity. The above value of \kappa suggests that RuB_{2} is an extreme type-I superconductor. This is consistent with the low H_{c} and the M(H_{\rm eff}) data presented above. The mean free path l can be estimated using the expression l=v_{F}\tau, where the Fermi velocity is v_{F}=\hbar k_{F}/m^{*} and the scattering time is given by the expression for the Drude conductivity \tau=m^{*}/ne^{2}\rho. Using m^{*}=m_{e} and the residual resistivity value \rho(1.6 K)=1.1\mu\Omega cm, we estimate l\approx 72 nm. From the above estimates of \xi and l we conclude that \xi\gg l, making RuB_{2} a dirty limit superconductor. For a dirty limit superconductor we can make another estimate of the GL parameter as \kappa=0.75\lambda(0)/l\approx 0.66<0.707, again consistent with type-I behavior. We add that the estimation of the mean free path l is often affected by grain boundary scatterings, which can cause an underestimation of l. Thus the evaluated \kappa\approx 0.66 is an upper limit making our inference of type-I superconductivity even stronger.

## VII Band structure and Fermi surface

RuB_{2} crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system, space group Pmmn (no. 59). Each unit cell contains two formula units (two Ru atoms and four B atoms). The ionic and lattice relaxation were performed to optimize the crystal structure by using variable cell relaxation. We have used an energy cutoff of 55 Ry for the plane wave basis. The Brillouin zone integration is conducted with a 11\times 18\times 13 Monkhorst-pack grid for the K-point sampling. In the optimized crystal structure, the forces on all the atoms are less than 10^{-4} Ry/au. The calculated lattice parameters of the optimized RuB_{2} compound along

Figure 5: Critical field H_{c} vs T data extracted from the heat capacity C vs temperature T at various H. The solid curve through the data is a fit to the phenomenological BCS expression. The thermodynamic critical field H_{tc}(T) obtained from the C(T) data is also plotted for comparison. The solid curve through the H_{tc}(T) data is a guide to the eye (see text for details).

  with the experimental values are tabulated in Table 1. The calculated lattice parameters are within 1% of the experimental values [14].

The electronic band structure of RuB_{2} is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that several energy bands are crossing the Fermi level E_{F} confirming that RuB_{2} is a metal. Figure 7 shows the total and partial density of states (DOS) in units of states/eV showing the contribution of individual elements and orbitals to the DOS at various energies measured from the Fermi energy E_{F}. From Fig. 7 it can be seen that the 5d orbital of Ru and the 2p orbital of B make the main contributions to the density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The total DOS at \epsilon_{F} is found to be N(\epsilon_{F})=1.15 states/eV f.u. for both spin directions. This value is slightly smaller than the value N(\epsilon_{F})=1.40 states/eV f.u. estimated from the experimental value of \gamma. An estimate for the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{ep} can be made using the following relation: N(\epsilon_{F}) from heat capacity =[N(\epsilon_{F}) from band structure] (1+\lambda_{ep}).

A comparison of the above experimental and theoretical values of N(\epsilon_{F}) gives \lambda_{ep}\approx 0.22 which is close to but slightly smaller than the values obtained above using McMillan's formula.

We have also obtained the Fermi surface for RuB_{2}. The merged Fermi surface within the first Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 8. The Fermi surface consists of four FS sheets: one quasi-two-dimensional tubular sheet and two concentric ellipsoidal sheets very similar to OsB_{2}[16]. An additional small fourth sheet nested inside the tubular sheet is also found for RuB_{2}.

## VIII Summary and discussion

Using electrical resistivity \rho(T), magnetic susceptibility \chi(T), magnetization M(H), and specific heat C(T,H) data we have confirmed bulk superconductivity in RuB_{2} with a superconducting critical temperature T_{c}=1.5 K. The T=0 critical field is estimated to be H_{c}(0)=122 Oe. The magnitude of the anomaly in specific heat at T_{c} in zero field is observed to be \Delta C/\gamma_{s}T_{c}\approx 1.1, which is much smaller than the value 1.43 expected for a single-gap BCS superconductor. This observation is similar to what has previously been observed for MgB_{2} and OsB_{2}, and suggests multigap superconductivity in RuB_{2}. This is confirmed by the excellent fitting of the electronic specific heat below T_{c} to a two-gap model with the value of the two gaps estimated as \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.88 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.13. The value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} in a magnetic field becomes larger than its zero field value strongly indicating type-I behavior. This is also similar to what was observed earlier for OsB_{2} and also for other candidate type-I superconductors like ScGa_{3} and LaGa_{3}[24] and YbSb_{2}[26]. The M(H_{\rm eff}) behavior are also consistent with type-I superconductivity. This is confirmed by

These results strongly suggest that RuB_{2} is a rare alloy type-I superconductor and may be the first multigap type-I superconductor. We note that both YbSb_{2} (\kappa\approx 0.05 and \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}< BCS) [26] and boron-doped SiC (\kappa\approx 0.35 and \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}< BCS) [31] have been reported as type-I superconductors and have specific heat anomalies smaller than expected for single band BCS superconductivity. However, both reported materials were multiphase samples and, in YbSb_{2}, an additional superconducting phase with a lower T_{c} than the bulk T_{c} was also observed, making it complicated to estimate intrinsic superconducting parameters. Thus RuB_{2} seems to be the best candidate for two-gap type-I superconductivity so far.

However, a scenario (anisotropic type-I superconductivity) like the one recently suggested for OsB_{2}[17] could also be at play in RuB_{2} and future work like imaging of magnetic flux entering the material may be useful to confirm the type of superconductivity in RuB_{2}.

###### Abstract

The structure of the layered transition-metal borides AB_{2} (A= Os, Ru) is built up by alternating T and B layers with the B layers forming a puckered honeycomb. Here we report superconducting properties of RuB_{2} with a T_{c}\approx 1.5 K using measurements of the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature T, magnetization M versus magnetic field H, resistivity versus T, and heat capacity versus T at various H. We observe a reduced heat capacity anomaly at T_{c} given by \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}\approx 1.1 suggesting multigap superconductivity. Strong support for this is obtained by the successful fitting of the electronic specific heat data to a two-gap model with gap values \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.88 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.13. Additionally, M versus H measurements reveal a behavior consistent with type-I superconductivity. This is confirmed by comparing the experimental critical field \approx122 Oe obtained from extrapolation to T=0 of the H-T phase diagram, with an estimate of the T=0 thermodynamic critical field \approx114 Oe. Additionally, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter was estimated to be \kappa\approx 0.1-0.66. These results strongly suggest multigap type-I superconductivity in RuB_{2}. We also calculate the band structure and obtain the Fermi surface for RuB_{2}. The Fermi surface consists of one quasi-two-dimensional sheet and two concentric ellipsoidal sheets very similar to OsB_{2}. An additional small fourth sheet is also found for RuB_{2}. RuB_{2} could thus be an example of a multigap type-I superconductor.

## 1 Introduction

The discovery of multigap superconductivity in MgB_{2}[1, 2] has led to a revival of interest and activity in the search for similar behavior in other superconductors. There are now several accepted candidate multigap superconductors such as NbSe_{2}[3], RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R= Lu and Y) [4], Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}[5, 6], Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[7], and more recently FeSe [8, 9]. Multigap superconductors are associated with several anomalous superconducting properties, for example, a reduced heat capacity jump at the superconducting critical temperature \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}, a non-BCS temperature dependence of the upper critical field, and a non-BCS penetration depth versus temperature. These anomalous properties are mostly connected with Fermi surface sheets with very different characters. This is exemplified most clearly in the case of MgB_{2}[10, 11, 12, 13].

Recently OsB_{2}, which has a layered structure with puckered honeycomb boron planes alternating with osmium planes stacked along the c axis of an orthorhombic cell, has been studied for its superhardness as well as for its superconducting properties. Several anomalous superconducting properties like upward curvature in the H_{c}(T) curve, reduced heat capacity anomaly at T_{c}, non-BCS temperature dependence of the penetration depth, small Ginzburg-Landau parameters \kappa\sim 1-2, and a first-order superconducting transition in a magnetic field have been observed for OsB_{2}[14, 15]. These properties were interpreted as signatures of two-gap superconductivity. A fit by a two-gap model to the T dependent penetration depth data gave the values \Delta_{1}\approx 1.25k_{B}T_{c} and \Delta_{2}\approx 1.9k_{B}T_{c} for the two gaps, respectively [15]. The Fermi surface of OsB_{2} consists of a quasi-two-dimensional sheet and two concentric ellipsoidal sheets [16]. The two gaps were argued to open on the two ellipsoidal Fermi surface sheets which are very similar in character and size [15], unlike the two gaps in MgB_{2} which open on two Fermi sheets which are very different in character [13].

However, an alternate view has recently been put forward for these anomalous properties of OsB_{2} with proposal of extreme type-I superconductivity (very small \kappa) and a single but highly anisotropic gap [17].

RuB_{2} is isostructural to OsB_{2} and is also reported to become superconducting below T_{c}\approx 1.5 K [18]. Although its normal state properties have been studied in detail [14], the superconducting properties have not been explored. Given the anomalous superconducting properties of OsB_{2}, it would be interesting to make a detailed study of the superconducting properties of RuB_{2} to look for similar anomalous properties. In this work we report the superconducting properties of polycrystalline samples of RuB_{2}. We confirm that RuB_{2} exhibits bulk superconductivity below a critical temperature T_{c}=1.5 K. The magnetization versus magnetic field data suggest type-I superconductivity. We estimate an electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{ep}=0.39-0.45 suggesting moderate coupling superconductivity in RuB_{2}. The extrapolated T=0 critical field H_{c}(0)\approx 122 Oe is small and consistent with type-I superconductivity. The normalized heat capacity jump at T_{c} was estimated to be \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}\approx 1.1, which is much smaller than the value 1.43 expected for a single-gap s-wave BCS superconductor and suggests multigap superconductivity. This is confirmed by obtaining an excellent fit of the electronic specific heat data below T_{c} to a phenomenological two-gap model. The fit gave the gap values \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.88 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.13 for the two gaps. The jump in the heat capacity at T_{c} becomes larger in applied magnetic fields again suggesting type-I behavior. These suggestions are confirmed by estimates of the Ginzburg Landau parameter \kappa=0.1-0.6, which is smaller than the value 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707, the border between type-I and type-II superconductivity. Thus RuB_{2} could be a rare example of a multigap type-I superconductor. Additionally, we calculate the band structure and obtain the Fermi surface of RuB_{2}. The band structure confirms metallic behavior with majority contribution to the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy (\epsilon_{F}) coming from Ru 4d and B 2p orbitals. We calculate the total DOS for both spin directions \epsilon_{F}=1.17 states/eV f.u., where "f.u." stands for "formula unit." This value is similar to the value reported for OsB_{2}[14]. The Fermi surface consists of four sheets. There is one quasi-two-dimensional corrugated tubular sheet and two concentric ellipsoidal sheets, very similar to OsB_{2}[14]. An additional small fourth sheet is found which was not obtained for OsB_{2}.

## II Experimental and theoretical methods

Polycrystalline samples of RuB_{2} were synthesized by arc-melting stoichiometric ratios of Ru (5N, Alfa Aesar) and B (6N, Alfa Aesar) 5-10 times to promote homogeneity [14]. Powder x-ray diffraction confirmed that the synthesized material is single phase and a refinement of the powder pattern gave lattice parameters which match well with the reported values [14]. The dc magnetic susceptibility \chi versus temperature data in the temperature T range T=0.280 K to 2 K and magnetization M versus field H data at T=310 mK were measured using a He3 insert in a SQUID magnetometer from Cryogenics Limited, UK. The heat capacity C data from 85 mK to 3 K was measured using the dilution refrigerator (DR) option of a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (QD-PPMS). The electrical transport from 300 mK to 300 K was measured using the He3 insert in a QD-PPMS. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were done using the quantum-expresso code [19]. Electronic exchange and correlation are described using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using Perdew-Bruke-Ernzerhof functional [20]. In the DFT calculation, spin-orbit coupling was not included. However, we have used scalar relativistic potential which takes scalar relativistic effects into account.

## III Electrical resistivity

The electrical resistivity \rho versus temperature T data for RuB_{2} measured with an excitation current of 5 mA in zero applied magnetic field are shown in Fig. 1 between T=0.5 K and 315 K. The T=315 K value of resistivity is \rho(315 K) \approx 22.5\mu\Omega cm and the residual resistivity is \rho(1.6 K) \approx 1.1\mu\Omega cm giving a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) \approx 21. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the \rho(T) data below T=5.25 K to highlight the sharp drop to zero resistance below T_{c}=1.5 K signaling the onset of superconductivity in RuB_{2}.

## IV Magnetic properties

Figure 2 shows the results of magnetic measurements on RuB_{2}. Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) volume magnetic susceptibility \chi_{v} normalized by 1/4\pi. The data were measured in a field of 10 Oe between 0.28 K and 1.8 K. The sharp drop in \chi_{v} to diamagnetic values below \approx 1.55 K confirms the onset of the superconducting state. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows the d\chi_{v}/dT vs T data and the peak position is taken as the superconducting critical temperature T_{c}=1.5 K. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak in d\chi_{v}/dT gives an estimate of the superconducting transition width and is \approx50 mK. The \chi_{v} data have not been corrected for the demagnetization factor N. Thus the observed value is 4\pi\,\chi_{v}=\frac{1}{1-N} and therefore larger than -1 expected for 100\% superconducting volume fraction. Assuming 100\% superconducting volume fraction we estimate N\approx 0.32 from the data shown in Fig. 2(a). However, often in polycrystalline samples the superconducting fraction is smaller than 100\% and to estimate the actual superconducting fraction one needs the value of N. For idealized shapes of samples, N has been calculated. For example, N=1/3 for a sphere and 1 for an ellipsoid of revolution. Our sample is an irregular shaped piece broken from an arc-melted button and looks like a squashed ellipsoid with dimensions a\approx b=1.61 mm \neq c=1.35 mm. We therefore approximate our irregular shaped sample with a prolate ellipsoid with c/a\approx 0.83. For such an object, N\approx 0.38[21]. Using this value of N we find a superconducting volume fraction of \approx 90\%.

Figure 2(b) shows the volume magnetization M_{v} normalized by 1/4\pi versus magnetic field H for RuB_{2} measured at a temperature T=310 mK, well inside the superconducting state. The shape of the 4\pi\,M_{v} vs H data are very different from those expected for typical type-II superconductors but are similar to that expected for a type-I superconductor with demagnetization factors. To account for demagnetization effects the magnetization can be plotted versus an effective magnetic field H_{\rm eff}=H-NM. This has been done using the N\approx 0.38 estimated above and the resulting M(H_{\rm eff}) data are shown in Fig. 2(b), inset. These data look like the behavior expected for a type-I superconductor. The slight negative slope of the data at the transition most likely occurs from a slightly overestimated N.

Figure 1: Electrical resistivity \rho vs temperature T for RuB_{2} measured in zero magnetic field between T=0.4 and 310 K. The inset shows the data below T=5.5 K to highlight the abrupt drop at T_{c}=1.5 K signaling the transition to the superconducting state.

  

## V Heat Capacity

Figure 3(a) shows the specific heat C versus T data for RuB_{2} measured between T=85 mK and 3 K in magnetic fields H=0 Oe and H=250 Oe. A sharp anomaly near T_{c}=1.5 K in the H=0 data confirms bulk superconductivity in RuB_{2}. The data at H=250 Oe doesn't show any signature of superconductivity and will be used as the normal state data. We will later show that this field is indeed much higher than the estimated critical field. The C(T) data at H=250 Oe were fit by the expression C=\gamma_{n}T+\beta T^{3} where \gamma_{n} is the normal state Sommerfeld coefficient and the second term is the contribution from the lattice. The fit shown as the solid curve through the H=250 Oe data in Fig. 3(a) gave the values \gamma_{n}=1.65(2) mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta=0.014(2) mJ/mol K^{4}.

Figure 3: (a) Specific heat C vs T for RuB_{2} measured in magnetic fields H=0 and 250 Oe. The solid curve through the 250 Oe data is a fit by the expression C=\gamma T+\beta T^{3}. (b) The electronic specific heat divided by temperature C_{d}/T vs T for RuB_{2}. An equal entropy construction is shown to give a T_{c}=1.46 K and \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}=1.1, where \gamma=\gamma_{n}-\gamma_{\rm res}. (c) A two-gap model fit (solid curve) to the C_{d} data and expectation for a single BCS gap (dash-dot curve) (see text for details).

Figure 2: (a) Temperature T dependence of the zero field cooled (ZFC) dimensionless volume susceptibility \chi_{v} in terms of the superconducting volume fraction 4\pi\,\chi_{v} of RuB_{2} measured in a magnetic field H=10 Oe. At low T, the 4\pi\,\chi_{v} values are more negative than -1 due to demagnetization effects. The inset shows the d\chi/dT vs T data to highlight the superconducting transition at T_{c}=1.5 K. (b) The volume magnetization M_{n} normalized by 1/4\pi vs applied magnetic field H measured at T=310 mK. The inset shows the 4\pi\,M_{V} vs effective magnetic field H_{\rm eff}=H-NM corrected for the demagnetization effects. These data show behavior typical of type-I superconductivity.

 This value of \beta gives a Debye temperature of \theta_{D}=720(30) K which is similar to the value found previously [15]. The lattice contribution \beta T^{3} to the total specific heat C(T) can be subtracted to get the electronic contribution C_{el}(T). The C_{el}(T) so obtained is shown in Fig. 3(b). The sharp anomaly at T_{c} as well as the exponential fall at the lowest temperatures expected for s-wave superconductors is clearly visible. We also note that C_{el} tends to a finite value as T\to 0 suggesting some nonsuperconducting fraction in the sample. The data below \approx 0.3 K were fit by the expression C_{el}/T=\gamma_{\text{res}}+(A/T)\text{exp}(-\Delta/T), where \gamma_{\text{res}} is the residual Sommerfeld coefficient from the nonsuperconducting fraction of the sample and the second term is a phenomenological exponential decay expected for a gapped system. The fit shown as the solid curve through the data below T\approx 0.3 K in Fig. 3(b) gives the value \gamma_{\text{res}}=0.36 mJ/mol K^{2}. With the total \gamma_{n}=1.65 mJ/mol K^{2} and the residual nonsuperconducting \gamma_{\text{res}}=0.36 mJ/mol K^{2}, the superconducting contribution becomes \gamma_{s}=1.29 mJ/mol K^{2}. This suggests that \approx22% of the sample volume is nonsuperconducting.

We can now analyze the specific heat jump height at T_{c}. The jump \Delta C at T_{c} is normalized as \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}, where \gamma is the Sommerfeld coefficient of the superconducting part. The superconducting transition can be broadened and the jump height suppressed in real materials due to a distribution of T_{c} arising from sample inhomogeneities or disorder. To get a better estimate of \Delta C and T_{c} we use an entropy-conserving construction. In such a construction the C_{el} data just below the maximum of the anomaly is fit by a polynomial and extrapolated to higher temperatures. The entropy is then evaluated and equated to the normal state entropy \gamma_{n}T_{c}. Such a construction gave the jump height \Delta C/T_{c}=3.07-1.65=1.42 mJ/mol K^{2} and T_{c}=1.46 K as shown in Fig. 3(b). The T_{c} found by this entropy-conserving construction is quite close to the onset temperature 1.5 K indicating the sharp transition and suggesting a very good sample quality with very little disorder and inhomogeneities. Using the above \Delta C/T_{c}=1.42 mJ/mol K^{2} and the superconducting contribution \gamma_{s}=1.29 mJ/mol K^{2} we estimate \Delta C/\gamma_{s}T_{c}=1.44/1.29\approx 1.12. This value is much smaller than the value 1.43 expected for a single-gap s-wave superconductor. The reduced value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} is similar to observations for MgB_{2}[10] and OsB_{2}[14; 15] and suggests multigap superconductivity.

To confirm this possibility we have attempted to fit our C_{el}(T) data below T_{c} to a phenomenological two-gap model as has been reported for example for MgB_{2}[22]. The T=0 value of the two superconducting gaps \Delta_{1} and \Delta_{2}, the critical temperature T_{c}, and the fractional contribution of the first band x were the three fit parameters. An excellent fit, shown in Fig. 3(c) as the solid curve through the C_{el}/T data below T_{c}, was obtained with the fit parameters \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.88, \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.13, T_{c}\approx 1.47 K, and x=0.58. If we compare the values of the two gaps we estimate above to the single band BCS value \Delta/k_{B}T_{c}=1.76 we see that our values agree with the theorem that for a two-gap superconductor one of the gaps will always be larger than the BCS value while the second gap will always be smaller [23]. For comparison, we also show in Fig. 3(c) the simulated data for a superconductor with a single BCS gap with T_{c}=1.47 K which clearly doesn't match the data. Thus the heat capacity data in Fig. 3 strongly indicate that RuB_{2} could be a two-gap superconductor.

Figure 4(a) shows the specific heat C versus T data for RuB_{2} measured between T=85 mK and 3.5 K at various applied magnetic fields H. All data were measured by cooling in zero field to the lowest temperature and then measuring while warming up in the desired magnetic field. As expected, the SC transition is pushed to lower temperatures in increasing fields and is not observed down to the lowest temperature for fields H\geqslant 150 Oe. The specific heat divided by temperature C/T versus T at various magnetic fields is plotted in Fig. 4(b). From Fig. 4(b) we observe that the magnitude of the peak at T_{c} initially increases in a magnetic field. In a magnetic field the transition for a type-I superconductor becomes first order. Thus one should in principle observe a diverging anomaly at T_{c}. In real materials, however, the anomaly is broadened due to sample inhomogeneity and as a consequence the anomaly looks like a jump larger than that in zero field. Thus the observed behavior in Fig. 4(b) also points to type-I superconductivity in RuB_{2}. This is similar to what was observed for OsB_{2}[15] and for other type-I superconductors like ScGa_{3} and LaGa_{3}[24; 25] and YbSb_{2}[26]. This is consistent with the magnetization data of Fig. 2(b), inset, which also suggest type-I superconductivity.

The above value of \gamma can be used to estimate the density of states at the Fermi energy (\epsilon_{F}) for both spin directions N(\epsilon_{F}) by using the expression \gamma=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}k_{B}^{2}N(\epsilon_{F}). Using \gamma=1.65 mJ/mol K^{2} we obtain N(\epsilon_{F})\approx 1.40 states/eV f.u. We

  will compare this value with estimations from band structure calculations later.

## VI Superconducting parameters

The C(T,H) data presented above were used to extract the critical temperature at various magnetic fields. The critical field H_{c} versus T data thus obtained is shown in Fig. 5. The data were fit by the phenomenological expression H_{c}(T)=H_{c}(0)[1-(\frac{T}{T_{c}})^{2}] with H_{c}(0) and T_{c} as fitting parameters, where H_{c}(0) is the zero temperature critical field. The fit, shown as the solid curve through the data in Fig. 5, extrapolated to T=0 gave the values H_{c}(0)=122 Oe and T_{c}=1.48 K. The satisfactory fit to the above expression suggests BCS superconductivity in RuB_{2}.

An estimate for the T dependent thermodynamic critical field H_{tc}(T) can be made from the electronic heat capacity data C_{el}(T) using the expression [\mu_{0}H_{tc}(T)]^{2}/2=F_{en}-F_{es}=-\gamma(T^{2}+T_{c}^{2})/2+\int_{T^{c}}^ {T_{c}}C_{el}(T)dT+T\int_{0}^{T}\frac{C_{el}(T)}{T}dT, where F_{en} and F_{es} are the electronic free energy in the normal and superconducting state, respectively [27]. In particular, the T=0 thermodynamic critical field H_{tc}(0) can be estimated by inserting T=0 in the above expression giving (\mu_{0}H_{tc}(0))^{2}/2=-\gamma\,T_{c}^{2}/2+\int_{0}^{T}C_{el}(T)dT. Using \gamma_{s}=1.3 mJ mol K^{2} and T_{c}=1.46 K obtained from an equal entropy construction above, we estimate the T=0 thermodynamic critical field H_{tc}(0)\approx 114 Oe. This is slightly smaller but close to the estimate 122 Oe made from the H-T phase diagram and suggests type-I superconductivity in RuB_{2}. This is supported by estimates of the Ginzburg Landau parameter below. For comparison with the experimental H-T diagram obtained from C(T,H) data, the H_{tc}(T) estimated by using the above expression are also shown in Fig. 5.

The electron-phonon coupling \lambda_{\rm ep} can be estimated using McMillan's formula [28], which relates the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} to \lambda_{\rm ep}, the Debye temperature \theta_{D}, and the Coulumb pseudopotential \mu^{*}. This formula can be inverted to get \lambda_{\rm ep} in terms of the other parameters,

\[\lambda_{\rm ep}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\text{ln}\big{(}\frac{\theta_{D}}{1.4S_{T} }\big{)}}{(1-0.62\mu^{*})\text{ln}\big{(}\frac{\theta_{D}}{1.4S_{T}}\big{)}-1. 04}.\]

Using, \theta_{D}=700 K obtained from heat capacity measurements above and using T_{c}=1.5 K, we get \lambda_{\rm ep}=0.37 and 0.45 for \mu^{*}=0.1 and 0.15, respectively. These values are slightly smaller than values obtained for OsB_{2}[14] consistent with a slightly smaller T_{c} compared to OsB_{2}. These values of \lambda_{\rm ep} are consistent with previous theoretical values [29] and suggest moderate-coupling superconductivity in RuB_{2}. The corresponding value for MgB_{2} is \lambda_{\rm ep}\approx 1[30].

We now estimate the T=0 values of the penetration depth \lambda(0) and coherence length \xi(0). RuB_{2} has two formulas units per unit cell. This means that there are four electrons in one unit cell volume V=53.84 A^{3}. Therefore, the electron density is n=4/V=7.4\times 10^{-2} A^{-3}. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, we can use the above value of n to estimate the Fermi wave vector k_{F}=(3n\pi^{2})^{1/3}=1.3 A^{-1}. The London penetration depth is given by \lambda(0)=(m^{*}/\mu_{0}ne^{2})^{1/2}, where we take the effective mass m^{*} as the free electron mass m_{e}. Putting in values gives us \lambda(0)\approx 47 nm. The BCS coherence length can be estimated using the expression \xi=\frac{0.18\xi^{2}k_{F}}{k_{B}T,m^{*}}\approx 0.45\mum. The Ginzburg Landau (GL) parameter can now be estimated as \kappa=0.96\lambda(0)/\xi\approx 0.1 which is much smaller than the value 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707 separating type-I and type-II superconductivity. The above value of \kappa suggests that RuB_{2} is an extreme type-I superconductor. This is consistent with the low H_{c} and the M(H_{\rm eff}) data presented above. The mean free path l can be estimated using the expression l=v_{F}\tau, where the Fermi velocity is v_{F}=\hbar k_{F}/m^{*} and the scattering time is given by the expression for the Drude conductivity \tau=m^{*}/ne^{2}\rho. Using m^{*}=m_{e} and the residual resistivity value \rho(1.6 K)=1.1\mu\Omega cm, we estimate l\approx 72 nm. From the above estimates of \xi and l we conclude that \xi\gg l, making RuB_{2} a dirty limit superconductor. For a dirty limit superconductor we can make another estimate of the GL parameter as \kappa=0.75\lambda(0)/l\approx 0.66<0.707, again consistent with type-I behavior. We add that the estimation of the mean free path l is often affected by grain boundary scatterings, which can cause an underestimation of l. Thus the evaluated \kappa\approx 0.66 is an upper limit making our inference of type-I superconductivity even stronger.

## VII Band structure and Fermi surface

RuB_{2} crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system, space group Pmmn (no. 59). Each unit cell contains two formula units (two Ru atoms and four B atoms). The ionic and lattice relaxation were performed to optimize the crystal structure by using variable cell relaxation. We have used an energy cutoff of 55 Ry for the plane wave basis. The Brillouin zone integration is conducted with a 11\times 18\times 13 Monkhorst-pack grid for the K-point sampling. In the optimized crystal structure, the forces on all the atoms are less than 10^{-4} Ry/au. The calculated lattice parameters of the optimized RuB_{2} compound along

Figure 5: Critical field H_{c} vs T data extracted from the heat capacity C vs temperature T at various H. The solid curve through the data is a fit to the phenomenological BCS expression. The thermodynamic critical field H_{tc}(T) obtained from the C(T) data is also plotted for comparison. The solid curve through the H_{tc}(T) data is a guide to the eye (see text for details).

  with the experimental values are tabulated in Table 1. The calculated lattice parameters are within 1% of the experimental values [14].

The electronic band structure of RuB_{2} is shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that several energy bands are crossing the Fermi level E_{F} confirming that RuB_{2} is a metal. Figure 7 shows the total and partial density of states (DOS) in units of states/eV showing the contribution of individual elements and orbitals to the DOS at various energies measured from the Fermi energy E_{F}. From Fig. 7 it can be seen that the 5d orbital of Ru and the 2p orbital of B make the main contributions to the density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The total DOS at \epsilon_{F} is found to be N(\epsilon_{F})=1.15 states/eV f.u. for both spin directions. This value is slightly smaller than the value N(\epsilon_{F})=1.40 states/eV f.u. estimated from the experimental value of \gamma. An estimate for the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{ep} can be made using the following relation: N(\epsilon_{F}) from heat capacity =[N(\epsilon_{F}) from band structure] (1+\lambda_{ep}).

A comparison of the above experimental and theoretical values of N(\epsilon_{F}) gives \lambda_{ep}\approx 0.22 which is close to but slightly smaller than the values obtained above using McMillan's formula.

We have also obtained the Fermi surface for RuB_{2}. The merged Fermi surface within the first Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 8. The Fermi surface consists of four FS sheets: one quasi-two-dimensional tubular sheet and two concentric ellipsoidal sheets very similar to OsB_{2}[16]. An additional small fourth sheet nested inside the tubular sheet is also found for RuB_{2}.

## VIII Summary and discussion

Using electrical resistivity \rho(T), magnetic susceptibility \chi(T), magnetization M(H), and specific heat C(T,H) data we have confirmed bulk superconductivity in RuB_{2} with a superconducting critical temperature T_{c}=1.5 K. The T=0 critical field is estimated to be H_{c}(0)=122 Oe. The magnitude of the anomaly in specific heat at T_{c} in zero field is observed to be \Delta C/\gamma_{s}T_{c}\approx 1.1, which is much smaller than the value 1.43 expected for a single-gap BCS superconductor. This observation is similar to what has previously been observed for MgB_{2} and OsB_{2}, and suggests multigap superconductivity in RuB_{2}. This is confirmed by the excellent fitting of the electronic specific heat below T_{c} to a two-gap model with the value of the two gaps estimated as \Delta_{1}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.88 and \Delta_{2}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.13. The value of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} in a magnetic field becomes larger than its zero field value strongly indicating type-I behavior. This is also similar to what was observed earlier for OsB_{2} and also for other candidate type-I superconductors like ScGa_{3} and LaGa_{3}[24] and YbSb_{2}[26]. The M(H_{\rm eff}) behavior are also consistent with type-I superconductivity. This is confirmed by

  estimates of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa which comes out to be \kappa\approx 0.1-0.6<0.707. These results strongly suggest that RuB_{2} is a rare alloy type-I superconductor and may be the first multigap type-I superconductor. We note that both YbSb_{2} (\kappa\approx 0.05 and \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}< BCS) [26] and boron-doped SiC (\kappa\approx 0.35 and \Delta C/\gamma\,T_{c}< BCS) [31] have been reported as type-I superconductors and have specific heat anomalies smaller than expected for single band BCS superconductivity. However, both reported materials were multiphase samples and, in YbSb_{2}, an additional superconducting phase with a lower T_{c} than the bulk T_{c} was also observed, making it complicated to estimate intrinsic superconducting parameters. Thus RuB_{2} seems to be the best candidate for two-gap type-I superconductivity so far.

However, a scenario (anisotropic type-I superconductivity) like the one recently suggested for OsB_{2}[17] could also be at play in RuB_{2} and future work like imaging of magnetic flux entering the material may be useful to confirm the type of superconductivity in RuB_{2}.
