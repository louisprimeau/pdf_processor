Yokohama 226-8503, Japan pressed by the occurrence of a superconducting
gap and β is the lattice heat-capacity coefficient. The finite values of
$\gamma_{\rm SC}$ for the superconducting samples would be attributed to
the presence of impurities, as observed in various systems,[16; 17] The
Debye temperature (Θ_(D)) estimated from β is 319 (x = 0.05), 308
(x=0.11), and 332 K (x=0.14), which is lower than that of LaFePO
(Θ_(D)=371 K),[16] probably because of the heavier mass of As compared
to P.

For x=0 and 0.025, C_(p)/T distinctly departs from linear dependence
below 6 K. This temperature dependence can be fitted with the
characteristic $T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF})$ term of spin-fluctuation system.
The total heat capacity can then be written as

$$C_{p}=\gamma_{\rm SF}T+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF}),$$
(1)

where $\gamma_{\rm SF}$ represents the electronic heat-capacity
coefficient enhanced by spin fluctuation and δ is the coefficient of the
spin-fluctuation term.[15] Assuming that the average of β in these
superconducting samples is equal to that in nonsuperconducting samples
(x=0 and 0.025), Eq. (1) yields $T_{\rm SF}$ = 12 ± 1 and 13 ± 1 K for
x=0 and 0.025, respectively (where the error bars on $T_{\rm SF}$ are
estimated from the standard deviation of β). Figure 2(b) displays the χ
versus T² plots of x=0 and 0.025 samples in the low-temperature region.
χ shows a linear dependence on T² rather than the Curie-Weiss law.
Beal-Monod _et al.[14]_ reported that the characteristic temperature
dependence of χ in the FM spin-fluctuation system can be approximated as
X =$\chi_{0}[1-(3.2\,\pi^{2}/24)(T/T_{\rm SF})^{2}]$, where χ₀ is the
magnetic susceptibility at 0 K. Following this expression, we obtain
$T_{\rm SF}$ of 15 ± 1 and 22 ± 1 K for x=0 and 0.025, respectively.
Considering the fact that the difference in $T_{\rm SF}$ between C_(p)
and χ measurements has been reported in previous studies,[18;
19]$T_{\rm SF}$ values derived from these two independent measurements
appear to be consistent with each other. In any case, the two
measurements clearly demonstrate the presence of FM spin fluctuation in
x=0 and 0.025 samples.

Here, it is noted that the extrapolation of the high-temperature linear
part in C_(p)/T gives an electronic heat-capacity coefficient without
the spin-fluctuation effect (γ).[20] The values of γ obtained from this
method are 1.6 ± 1 and 3.2 ± 1 mJ K⁻² mol⁻¹ for x=0 and 0.025,
respectively. Assuming that the lattice contribution of LaFeAsO is the
same as those of LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x), the C_(p)^(′)/T above the T_(c)
[see inset of Fig. 1(a)] corresponds to the difference in γ, C_(p)^(′)/T
= γ(x) = γ(x=0). This assumption allows us to estimate γ=8.4 ± 2, 5.1 ±
2, and 3.8 ± 2 mJ K⁻² mol⁻¹ for x=0.05, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively,
where the error bar takes into account the uncertainties in C_(p)^(′)/T
above T_(c) and γ of the x=0 sample. Using these values, the normalized
heat-capacity jump (ΔC_(p)^(′)/γT_(c)) is estimated to be 0.60-0.97 and
0.90-2.0 for x=0.05 and 0.11, respectively. Although the

fits of C_(p)= $\gamma_{\rm SC}$=7 ϵ βT³, in which $\gamma_{\rm SC}$=2.6

and β=0.24 mJ K⁻⁴ mol⁻¹ for x=0.025. The other parameters are denoted in

data below 35 K. (c) Temperature dependence of ρ.

large error bars in the data do not allow a conclusive interpretation of
superconductivity, the value for x=0.05 is smaller than the
weak-coupling BCS value of 1.43.

The electronic density of states (N_(D)) can be calculated from γ using
the relation of γ=(1/3) π²_(B)²_(N_(D)), where k_(B) is the Boltzmann
constant. This equation gives N_(D)=0.7, 1.4, 3.6, 2.2, and 1.6
states/eV for x=0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively, which are
smaller than that of LaFePO (4.5 states/eV at T_(c)=3.3 K).[16] The
smaller N_(D) and Θ_(D) values in LaFeAsO should lead to lower T_(c)
within the framework of the phonon mediated BCS theory,[21] which is
inconsistent with higher T_(c). On the other hand, χ in a metal measures
the density of states enhanced by the FM spin fluctuations via
χ=μ_(B)²N_(D)^(*), where μ_(B) is the Bohr magneton and N_(D)^(*) is the
enhanced density of states. The N_(D)^(*) values calculated from the
data at 300 K (12, 20, 31, 20, and 12 states/eV for x=0, 0.025, 0.5,
0.11, and 0.14, respectively) are one orders of magnitude larger than
N_(D) obtained from C_(p). This large enhancement can be understood in
terms of the FM spin fluctuation.

The ratio of χ to γ at 0 K, which is known as the Wilson ratio (R_(W)),
is commonly used as a measure to assess the electric and magnetic
correlations between quasiparticles. In general, the ratio gives a
dimensionless value of R_(W)=1 for free-electron systems and R_(W)=2 for
strongly correlated systems. Nearly FM systems show very large values of
R_(W) [e.g., Pd, R_(W)=6−8;[22] TiBe₂, R_(w)=12 (Ref. [22]); and
Sr₃Ru₂O₇, R_(W)=10 (Ref. [23]) because of the enhancement of χ. In the
present compounds, we obtain significantly large R_(W) values of 6.5 and
11 for x=0 and 0.025, respectively,[18] indicating that LaFeAsO is
considered to be a system containing FM spin fluctuation. These values
are two to three times larger than that of the isostructural
oxyphosphide LaFePO (R_(W)=4.6, T_(c)=3.3 K)[16] and implying that the
stronger spin fluctuation induces a larger Wilson ratio and leads to
enhancement of T_(c). Such a relationship between T_(c) and R_(W) was
found in the pressure dependence of superfluid transition in ³He.[24]

For x=0 and 0.025, C_(p), χ, and ρ show an anomaly at about 150 K, as
shown in Fig. 1. To estimate the excess heat capacity ($C_{\rm ex}$)
associated with the anomaly, we assume a smoothly varying background [as
shown in Fig. 3(a)] and subtract it from the total measured C_(p).
Figure 3(b) shows the $C_{\rm ex}$ value near the anomaly. Apparently,
two peaks are present at 142 and 153 K for x=0–together with a small
drop in χ [Fig. 3(c)]. In contrast, there is only one peak at 134 K for
x=0.025. The entropy corresponding to the anomaly can be estimated to be
S=0.53 (0.09R ln 2) and 0.38 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ (0.07R ln 2) for x=0 and 0.025,
respectively, which are significantly smaller than the entropy
associated with the antiferromagnetic spin ordering (R ln 2) usually
seen in the Mott transition of cuprates.[25]

Figure 4 shows the phase diagram obtained by the data points of the
present measurements and by that of Ref. [12], together with the
variation of the overall thermodynamic quantities. With increasing x,
the anomaly at ∼150 K is driven down both in temperature and entropy,
and the superconducting state emerges rapidly. The superconducting state
appears for x≥0.035 with a maximum T_(c) of ∼26 K at x=0.11. For doping
in the region of x< 0.035, enhancements in $T_{\rm SF}$ and R_(W) are
observed. Together with the enhancement in the density of states
estimated from χ and C_(p), this behavior indicates an increase in the
FM fluctuation in this region.[26] In the whole region of χ, both
densities of states show similar x dependence; there is a cusplike
maximum at x=0.05. The cusplike behavior and the larger value of
N_(D)^(*) than N_(D) are similar to the critical behavior near the FM
instability.[26] Therefore, the x=0.05 sample may be located closest to
an FM instability. These results suggest that FM spin fluctuation can
induce a high superconducting transition temperature in the LaFeAsO
system, in sharp contrast to high-T_(c) cuprates driven by AF spin
fluctuation.

  \(\chi$ and C_(p) of LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (x=0 − 0.025) exhibit the
characteristic temperature dependence expected for a FM spin-fluctuation
system. Qualitative analysis of these data leads to an experimental
definition of the characteristic temperature ($T_{\rm SF}$), the Wilson
ratio ($R_{\rm W}$), and the densities of states (N_(D) and N_(D)^(*)).
These values indicate that the LaFeAsO system can be considered as a
nearly FM metal. Although the phase diagram obtained as a function of x
is analogous to the antiferromagnetism-superconductivity phase diagram
found in high-T_(c) cuprates, the observed entropy change and magnetic
behavior associated with the anomaly at ∼150 K are clearly different
from an antiferromagnetic transition. Considering the significantly
high-T_(c) value observed in the LaFeAsO system, further efforts are
certainly warranted.

After this Rapid Communication was submitted, we learned that the heat
capacity of isostructural oxyphosphide LaFePO also shows the
$T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF})$ term (Ref. [27]). This supports our conclusion
that the FM spin fluctuation is an intrinsic property in LaFeAsO system.
