 pressed by the occurrence of a superconducting gap and \beta is the lattice heat-capacity coefficient. The finite values of \gamma_{\rm SC} for the superconducting samples would be attributed to the presence of impurities, as observed in various systems,[16; 17] The Debye temperature (\Theta_{D}) estimated from \beta is 319 (x = 0.05), 308 (x=0.11), and 332 K (x=0.14), which is lower than that of LaFePO (\Theta_{D}=371 K),[16] probably because of the heavier mass of As compared to P.

For x=0 and 0.025, C_{p}/T distinctly departs from linear dependence below 6 K. This temperature dependence can be fitted with the characteristic T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF}) term of spin-fluctuation system. The total heat capacity can then be written as

\[C_{p}=\gamma_{\rm SF}T+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF}),\] (1)

where \gamma_{\rm SF} represents the electronic heat-capacity coefficient enhanced by spin fluctuation and \delta is the coefficient of the spin-fluctuation term.[15] Assuming that the average of \beta in these superconducting samples is equal to that in nonsuperconducting samples (x=0 and 0.025), Eq. (1) yields T_{\rm SF} = 12 \pm 1 and 13 \pm 1 K for x=0 and 0.025, respectively (where the error bars on T_{\rm SF} are estimated from the standard deviation of \beta). Figure 2(b) displays the \chi versus T^{2} plots of x=0 and 0.025 samples in the low-temperature region. \chi shows a linear dependence on T^{2} rather than the Curie-Weiss law. Beal-Monod _et al.[14]_ reported that the characteristic temperature dependence of \chi in the FM spin-fluctuation system can be approximated as X =\chi_{0}[1-(3.2\,\pi^{2}/24)(T/T_{\rm SF})^{2}], where \chi_{0} is the magnetic susceptibility at 0 K. Following this expression, we obtain T_{\rm SF} of 15 \pm 1 and 22 \pm 1 K for x=0 and 0.025, respectively. Considering the fact that the difference in T_{\rm SF} between C_{p} and \chi measurements has been reported in previous studies,[18; 19]T_{\rm SF} values derived from these two independent measurements appear to be consistent with each other. In any case, the two measurements clearly demonstrate the presence of FM spin fluctuation in x=0 and 0.025 samples.

Here, it is noted that the extrapolation of the high-temperature linear part in C_{p}/T gives an electronic heat-capacity coefficient without the spin-fluctuation effect (\gamma).[20] The values of \gamma obtained from this method are 1.6 \pm 1 and 3.2 \pm 1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} for x=0 and 0.025, respectively. Assuming that the lattice contribution of LaFeAsO is the same as those of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}, the C_{p}^{\prime}/T above the T_{c} [see inset of Fig. 1(a)] corresponds to the difference in \gamma, C_{p}^{\prime}/T = \gamma(x) = \gamma(x=0). This assumption allows us to estimate \gamma=8.4 \pm 2, 5.1 \pm 2, and 3.8 \pm 2 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} for x=0.05, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively, where the error bar takes into account the uncertainties in C_{p}^{\prime}/T above T_{c} and \gamma of the x=0 sample. Using these values, the normalized heat-capacity jump (\Delta C_{p}^{\prime}/\gamma T_{c}) is estimated to be 0.60-0.97 and 0.90-2.0 for x=0.05 and 0.11, respectively. Although the

The broken lines indicate the best fits of C_{p}= \gamma_{\rm SC}=7 \epsilon \beta T^{3}, in which \gamma_{\rm SC}=2.6 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.24 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} for x=0.05, \gamma_{\rm SC}=2.5 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.27 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1} for x=0.11, and \gamma_{\rm SC}=7.7 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.21 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1} for x=0.14. The solid curves indicate the fits of C_{p}= \gamma_{\rm SF}+ \beta T^{3}+(T/T_{\rm SF}) in which \gamma_{\rm SF} = 7.6 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.23 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1} for x=0, and \gamma_{\rm SF} = 9.6 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.24 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1} for x=0.025. The other parameters are denoted in the text. (b) \chi versus T^{2} plot for x=0 and 0.025.

The inset shows the heat-capacity difference (C_{p}^{\prime}) between superconducting samples and the nonsuperconducting LaFeAsO divided by temperature (C_{p}^{\prime}T^{+1}). (b) Temperature dependence of \chi. The data in the normal state are estimated from the slope of the magnetization curve between 1 and 2 T. The data in the superconducting state are estimated from the slope of the magnetization curve below 0.01 T. The inset of this figure shows the data below 35 K. (c) Temperature dependence of \rho.

  large error bars in the data do not allow a conclusive interpretation of superconductivity, the value for x=0.05 is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS value of 1.43.

The electronic density of states (N_{D}) can be calculated from \gamma using the relation of \gamma=(1/3) \pi^{2}_{B}^{2}_{N_{D}}, where k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. This equation gives N_{D}=0.7, 1.4, 3.6, 2.2, and 1.6 states/eV for x=0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively, which are smaller than that of LaFePO (4.5 states/eV at T_{c}=3.3 K).[16] The smaller N_{D} and \Theta_{D} values in LaFeAsO should lead to lower T_{c} within the framework of the phonon mediated BCS theory,[21] which is inconsistent with higher T_{c}. On the other hand, \chi in a metal measures the density of states enhanced by the FM spin fluctuations via \chi=\mu_{B}^{2}N_{D}^{*}, where \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton and N_{D}^{*} is the enhanced density of states. The N_{D}^{*} values calculated from the data at 300 K (12, 20, 31, 20, and 12 states/eV for x=0, 0.025, 0.5, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively) are one orders of magnitude larger than N_{D} obtained from C_{p}. This large enhancement can be understood in terms of the FM spin fluctuation.

The ratio of \chi to \gamma at 0 K, which is known as the Wilson ratio (R_{W}), is commonly used as a measure to assess the electric and magnetic correlations between quasiparticles. In general, the ratio gives a dimensionless value of R_{W}=1 for free-electron systems and R_{W}=2 for strongly correlated systems. Nearly FM systems show very large values of R_{W} [e.g., Pd, R_{W}=6-8;[22] TiBe_{2}, R_{w}=12 (Ref. [22]); and Sr_{3}Ru_{2}O_{7}, R_{W}=10 (Ref. [23]) because of the enhancement of \chi. In the present compounds, we obtain significantly large R_{W} values of 6.5 and 11 for x=0 and 0.025, respectively,[18] indicating that LaFeAsO is considered to be a system containing FM spin fluctuation. These values are two to three times larger than that of the isostructural oxyphosphide LaFePO (R_{W}=4.6, T_{c}=3.3 K)[16] and implying that the stronger spin fluctuation induces a larger Wilson ratio and leads to enhancement of T_{c}. Such a relationship between T_{c} and R_{W} was found in the pressure dependence of superfluid transition in ^{3}He.[24]

For x=0 and 0.025, C_{p}, \chi, and \rho show an anomaly at about 150 K, as shown in Fig. 1. To estimate the excess heat capacity (C_{\rm ex}) associated with the anomaly, we assume a smoothly varying background [as shown in Fig. 3(a)] and subtract it from the total measured C_{p}. Figure 3(b) shows the C_{\rm ex} value near the anomaly. Apparently, two peaks are present at 142 and 153 K for x=0--together with a small drop in \chi [Fig. 3(c)]. In contrast, there is only one peak at 134 K for x=0.025. The entropy corresponding to the anomaly can be estimated to be S=0.53 (0.09R ln 2) and 0.38 J mol^{-1} K^{-1} (0.07R ln 2) for x=0 and 0.025, respectively, which are significantly smaller than the entropy associated with the antiferromagnetic spin ordering (R ln 2) usually seen in the Mott transition of cuprates.[25]

Figure 4 shows the phase diagram obtained by the data points of the present measurements and by that of Ref. [12], together with the variation of the overall thermodynamic quantities. With increasing x, the anomaly at \sim150 K is driven down both in temperature and entropy, and the superconducting state emerges rapidly. The superconducting state appears for x\geq0.035 with a maximum T_{c} of \sim26 K at x=0.11. For doping in the region of x< 0.035, enhancements in T_{\rm SF} and R_{W} are observed. Together with the enhancement in the density of states estimated from \chi and C_{p}, this behavior indicates an increase in the FM fluctuation in this region.[26] In the whole region of \chi, both densities of states show similar x dependence; there is a cusplike maximum at x=0.05. The cusplike behavior and the larger value of N_{D}^{*} than N_{D} are similar to the critical behavior near the FM instability.[26] Therefore, the x=0.05 sample may be located closest to an FM instability. These results suggest that FM spin fluctuation can induce a high superconducting transition temperature in the LaFeAsO system, in sharp contrast to high-T_{c} cuprates driven by AF spin fluctuation.

Figure 3: (Color online) Thermal and magnetic property around 150 K. (a) Temperature dependence of Debye temperature (\Theta_{D}) calculated form the heat capacity using the relation of C=\rho_{B}^{2}_{N}

  \chi and C_{p} of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (x=0-0.025) exhibit the characteristic temperature dependence expected for a FM spin-fluctuation system. Qualitative analysis of these data leads to an experimental definition of the characteristic temperature (T_{\rm SF}), the Wilson ratio (R_{\rm W}), and the densities of states (N_{D} and N_{D}^{*}). These values indicate that the LaFeAsO system can be considered as a nearly FM metal. Although the phase diagram obtained as a function of x is analogous to the antiferromagnetism-superconductivity phase diagram found in high-T_{c} cuprates, the observed entropy change and magnetic behavior associated with the anomaly at \sim150 K are clearly different from an antiferromagnetic transition. Considering the significantly high-T_{c} value observed in the LaFeAsO system, further efforts are certainly warranted.

After this Rapid Communication was submitted, we learned that the heat capacity of isostructural oxyphosphide LaFePO also shows the T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF}) term (Ref. [27]). This supports our conclusion that the FM spin fluctuation is an intrinsic property in LaFeAsO system.

 pressed by the occurrence of a superconducting gap and \beta is the lattice heat-capacity coefficient. The finite values of \gamma_{\rm SC} for the superconducting samples would be attributed to the presence of impurities, as observed in various systems,[16; 17] The Debye temperature (\Theta_{D}) estimated from \beta is 319 (x = 0.05), 308 (x=0.11), and 332 K (x=0.14), which is lower than that of LaFePO (\Theta_{D}=371 K),[16] probably because of the heavier mass of As compared to P.

For x=0 and 0.025, C_{p}/T distinctly departs from linear dependence below 6 K. This temperature dependence can be fitted with the characteristic T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF}) term of spin-fluctuation system. The total heat capacity can then be written as

\[C_{p}=\gamma_{\rm SF}T+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF}),\] (1)

where \gamma_{\rm SF} represents the electronic heat-capacity coefficient enhanced by spin fluctuation and \delta is the coefficient of the spin-fluctuation term.[15] Assuming that the average of \beta in these superconducting samples is equal to that in nonsuperconducting samples (x=0 and 0.025), Eq. (1) yields T_{\rm SF} = 12 \pm 1 and 13 \pm 1 K for x=0 and 0.025, respectively (where the error bars on T_{\rm SF} are estimated from the standard deviation of \beta). Figure 2(b) displays the \chi versus T^{2} plots of x=0 and 0.025 samples in the low-temperature region. \chi shows a linear dependence on T^{2} rather than the Curie-Weiss law. Beal-Monod _et al.[14]_ reported that the characteristic temperature dependence of \chi in the FM spin-fluctuation system can be approximated as X =\chi_{0}[1-(3.2\,\pi^{2}/24)(T/T_{\rm SF})^{2}], where \chi_{0} is the magnetic susceptibility at 0 K. Following this expression, we obtain T_{\rm SF} of 15 \pm 1 and 22 \pm 1 K for x=0 and 0.025, respectively. Considering the fact that the difference in T_{\rm SF} between C_{p} and \chi measurements has been reported in previous studies,[18; 19]T_{\rm SF} values derived from these two independent measurements appear to be consistent with each other. In any case, the two measurements clearly demonstrate the presence of FM spin fluctuation in x=0 and 0.025 samples.

Here, it is noted that the extrapolation of the high-temperature linear part in C_{p}/T gives an electronic heat-capacity coefficient without the spin-fluctuation effect (\gamma).[20] The values of \gamma obtained from this method are 1.6 \pm 1 and 3.2 \pm 1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} for x=0 and 0.025, respectively. Assuming that the lattice contribution of LaFeAsO is the same as those of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}, the C_{p}^{\prime}/T above the T_{c} [see inset of Fig. 1(a)] corresponds to the difference in \gamma, C_{p}^{\prime}/T = \gamma(x) = \gamma(x=0). This assumption allows us to estimate \gamma=8.4 \pm 2, 5.1 \pm 2, and 3.8 \pm 2 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} for x=0.05, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively, where the error bar takes into account the uncertainties in C_{p}^{\prime}/T above T_{c} and \gamma of the x=0 sample. Using these values, the normalized heat-capacity jump (\Delta C_{p}^{\prime}/\gamma T_{c}) is estimated to be 0.60-0.97 and 0.90-2.0 for x=0.05 and 0.11, respectively. Although the

The broken lines indicate the best fits of C_{p}= \gamma_{\rm SC}=7 \epsilon \beta T^{3}, in which \gamma_{\rm SC}=2.6 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.24 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} for x=0.05, \gamma_{\rm SC}=2.5 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.27 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1} for x=0.11, and \gamma_{\rm SC}=7.7 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.21 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1} for x=0.14. The solid curves indicate the fits of C_{p}= \gamma_{\rm SF}+ \beta T^{3}+(T/T_{\rm SF}) in which \gamma_{\rm SF} = 7.6 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.23 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1} for x=0, and \gamma_{\rm SF} = 9.6 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and \beta=0.24 mJ K^{-4} mol^{-1} for x=0.025. The other parameters are denoted in the text. (b) \chi versus T^{2} plot for x=0 and 0.025.

The inset shows the heat-capacity difference (C_{p}^{\prime}) between superconducting samples and the nonsuperconducting LaFeAsO divided by temperature (C_{p}^{\prime}T^{+1}). (b) Temperature dependence of \chi. The data in the normal state are estimated from the slope of the magnetization curve between 1 and 2 T. The data in the superconducting state are estimated from the slope of the magnetization curve below 0.01 T. The inset of this figure shows the data below 35 K. (c) Temperature dependence of \rho.

  large error bars in the data do not allow a conclusive interpretation of superconductivity, the value for x=0.05 is smaller than the weak-coupling BCS value of 1.43.

The electronic density of states (N_{D}) can be calculated from \gamma using the relation of \gamma=(1/3) \pi^{2}_{B}^{2}_{N_{D}}, where k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. This equation gives N_{D}=0.7, 1.4, 3.6, 2.2, and 1.6 states/eV for x=0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively, which are smaller than that of LaFePO (4.5 states/eV at T_{c}=3.3 K).[16] The smaller N_{D} and \Theta_{D} values in LaFeAsO should lead to lower T_{c} within the framework of the phonon mediated BCS theory,[21] which is inconsistent with higher T_{c}. On the other hand, \chi in a metal measures the density of states enhanced by the FM spin fluctuations via \chi=\mu_{B}^{2}N_{D}^{*}, where \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton and N_{D}^{*} is the enhanced density of states. The N_{D}^{*} values calculated from the data at 300 K (12, 20, 31, 20, and 12 states/eV for x=0, 0.025, 0.5, 0.11, and 0.14, respectively) are one orders of magnitude larger than N_{D} obtained from C_{p}. This large enhancement can be understood in terms of the FM spin fluctuation.

The ratio of \chi to \gamma at 0 K, which is known as the Wilson ratio (R_{W}), is commonly used as a measure to assess the electric and magnetic correlations between quasiparticles. In general, the ratio gives a dimensionless value of R_{W}=1 for free-electron systems and R_{W}=2 for strongly correlated systems. Nearly FM systems show very large values of R_{W} [e.g., Pd, R_{W}=6-8;[22] TiBe_{2}, R_{w}=12 (Ref. [22]); and Sr_{3}Ru_{2}O_{7}, R_{W}=10 (Ref. [23]) because of the enhancement of \chi. In the present compounds, we obtain significantly large R_{W} values of 6.5 and 11 for x=0 and 0.025, respectively,[18] indicating that LaFeAsO is considered to be a system containing FM spin fluctuation. These values are two to three times larger than that of the isostructural oxyphosphide LaFePO (R_{W}=4.6, T_{c}=3.3 K)[16] and implying that the stronger spin fluctuation induces a larger Wilson ratio and leads to enhancement of T_{c}. Such a relationship between T_{c} and R_{W} was found in the pressure dependence of superfluid transition in ^{3}He.[24]

For x=0 and 0.025, C_{p}, \chi, and \rho show an anomaly at about 150 K, as shown in Fig. 1. To estimate the excess heat capacity (C_{\rm ex}) associated with the anomaly, we assume a smoothly varying background [as shown in Fig. 3(a)] and subtract it from the total measured C_{p}. Figure 3(b) shows the C_{\rm ex} value near the anomaly. Apparently, two peaks are present at 142 and 153 K for x=0--together with a small drop in \chi [Fig. 3(c)]. In contrast, there is only one peak at 134 K for x=0.025. The entropy corresponding to the anomaly can be estimated to be S=0.53 (0.09R ln 2) and 0.38 J mol^{-1} K^{-1} (0.07R ln 2) for x=0 and 0.025, respectively, which are significantly smaller than the entropy associated with the antiferromagnetic spin ordering (R ln 2) usually seen in the Mott transition of cuprates.[25]

Figure 4 shows the phase diagram obtained by the data points of the present measurements and by that of Ref. [12], together with the variation of the overall thermodynamic quantities. With increasing x, the anomaly at \sim150 K is driven down both in temperature and entropy, and the superconducting state emerges rapidly. The superconducting state appears for x\geq0.035 with a maximum T_{c} of \sim26 K at x=0.11. For doping in the region of x< 0.035, enhancements in T_{\rm SF} and R_{W} are observed. Together with the enhancement in the density of states estimated from \chi and C_{p}, this behavior indicates an increase in the FM fluctuation in this region.[26] In the whole region of \chi, both densities of states show similar x dependence; there is a cusplike maximum at x=0.05. The cusplike behavior and the larger value of N_{D}^{*} than N_{D} are similar to the critical behavior near the FM instability.[26] Therefore, the x=0.05 sample may be located closest to an FM instability. These results suggest that FM spin fluctuation can induce a high superconducting transition temperature in the LaFeAsO system, in sharp contrast to high-T_{c} cuprates driven by AF spin fluctuation.

  \chi and C_{p} of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (x=0-0.025) exhibit the characteristic temperature dependence expected for a FM spin-fluctuation system. Qualitative analysis of these data leads to an experimental definition of the characteristic temperature (T_{\rm SF}), the Wilson ratio (R_{\rm W}), and the densities of states (N_{D} and N_{D}^{*}). These values indicate that the LaFeAsO system can be considered as a nearly FM metal. Although the phase diagram obtained as a function of x is analogous to the antiferromagnetism-superconductivity phase diagram found in high-T_{c} cuprates, the observed entropy change and magnetic behavior associated with the anomaly at \sim150 K are clearly different from an antiferromagnetic transition. Considering the significantly high-T_{c} value observed in the LaFeAsO system, further efforts are certainly warranted.

After this Rapid Communication was submitted, we learned that the heat capacity of isostructural oxyphosphide LaFePO also shows the T^{3}\ln(T/T_{\rm SF}) term (Ref. [27]). This supports our conclusion that the FM spin fluctuation is an intrinsic property in LaFeAsO system.
