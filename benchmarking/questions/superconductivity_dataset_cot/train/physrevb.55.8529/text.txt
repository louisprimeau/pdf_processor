###### Abstract

The effects of hydrostatic pressure up to 1 GPa on the _ab_-plane electrical resistance of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ have been measured. Use of the Ambegaokar-Halperin (AH) model to examine the pressure effects on weak links across grain boundary leads to a value of 0.12 +- 0.02 GPa-1 for the pressure derivative _d_[lnA_(0)]_d_P of the energy gap D_f_(0) at junctions formed by grains; D_f_(0) for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ is about 10 times smaller than that of YBa2Cu2O7-_g_. The thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter have a two-dimensional character above \(T_{c}\) and below 115 K. Applying hydrostatic pressure enhances the thermodynamic fluctuations: creation of the superconducting quasiparticles well above \(T_{c}\) is enhanced under pressure. As pressure is increased, the characteristic thickness \(d\) of the two-dimensional system decreases nonlinearly by about 20% up to 0.71 GPa. The pressure derivatives _d_T__c_/_dP_ of the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) have been determined as 1.6 +- 0.3 KGPa-1, 1.8 +- 0.2 KGPa-1, and 3.0 +- 0.2 KGPa-1 at the onset, midpoint, and offset of the _R-T_ curve, respectively. Thermodynamic fluctuations affect _d_T__c_/_dP_ at onset. The large value of _d_T__c_/_dP_ at offset is due to the influence of the weak links at grain boundaries. A value of -1.4 is obtained for \(d\) ln_T__c_/_dP_ln_V_, which, like that for monocrystalline Bi2,2(Sr,Ca)2,5Cu2O8+, falls between those predicted by the BCS and the resonating valence-bond theories. In the normal state \(d\) ln_ph_/_dP_ is -8.4% +- 0.2 GPa-1 at 293 K and \(d\) ln_R__ab_/_dP_ is 2.01 +- 0.06. The pressure derivative \(d\) ln_R__ab_/_dP_ of the normal-state resistance of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+, shows a temperature dependence, which is affected by applied pressure and thermodynamic fluctuations.

## 1 Introduction

We have recently reported1 a detailed hydrostatic pressure investigation of the superconducting phase-transition temperature \(T_{c}\) and the normal-state resistance of monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2,8Cu2O8+, However, polycrystalline textured high-_T__c_ materials are more likely to find industrial applications and these materials have important microstructural differences that alter their electrical properties significantly from those obtained from measurements of single-crystal samples. These ceramics, which consist of superconducting grains and contain pores and microcracks, exhibit complex behavior associated with these defects, quite different in kind from that of single crystals. This behavior is attributed to thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter which affect the electrical resistance characteristics in both normal and superconducting states. Application of pressure influences these structural defects, especially interactive features across grain boundaries. Hence, it is instructive to compare the effects of pressure on the electrical properties of textured ceramics with those obtained for single crystals. A central objective is to investigate effects of pressure on the weak-link properties, which determine the transport critical-current density \(J_{c}\) at low magnetic field in polycrystalline materials,2 a major factor in limiting the application of high-_T__c_ superconducting materials.

## 2 Experiment

The samples of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+, were prepared at Argonne National Laboratory by the sinter-forging method.3 An x-ray-diffractometry study showed that their structural characteristics are similar to those obtained on another very dense textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ sample (Fig. 1 in Ref. 4). A large proportion of the grains are aligned preferentially with the _ab_ plane parallel to the top faces of the sample, while the \(c\) axis is perpendicular to these faces, along the sinter-forging direction. The electrical resistance of the textured sample was measured using a conventional four-point configuration aligned along the largest sample dimension. The major contribution to the measured electrical resistance \(R_{b}\) is \(R_{b}\) in the _ab_ plane, corresponding to a resistivity \(r_{b}\). The methods and procedures used to make electrical contacts and to measure the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the electrical resistance have been described elsewhere.1

## 3 Results

Typical measurements of the temperature dependence of the electrical resistance \(R_{b}\) at constant pressure are shown in Fig. 1. Excellent agreement was found between the data measured while decreasing or increasing temperature. For clarity, only those data measured while decreasing temperature are included in the figure.

### Normal state

The room-temperature (293 K) pressure dependence of the normal-state resistance, \(R_{b}\), of the textured sample is shown in Fig. 2, with the corresponding data for the monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2,8Cu2O8+,1 Several pressure cycles were measured and marked differences were obtained while increasing and decreasing the pressure, a feature not found for monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2,8Cu2O8+, whose room temperature resistance was accurately reversible during pressure cycling. The average pressure dependence \(d\) ln_Ra__b_/_dP_ = -6.3% +-0.2 GPa-1 of the textured sample is much smaller than that (-25.5% +-0.2 GPa-1) of the single crystal.

The pressure dependence of the in-plane resistance _Ra__b_ from 100 to 290 K is shown in Fig. 3. At 290 K, _Ra__b_ decreases almost linearly with increasing pressure. Below about 120 K, _Ra__b_ starts to show an opposite behavior in the low-pressure region: _Ra__b_ first increases as pressure is increased, and then decreases. This behavior is quite different from that observed in monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2.8Cu2O8+, for which the pressure dependence of _Ra__a_ is hardly affected by temperature (Figs. 7 and 8 in Ref. 1). The temperature dependence of the pressure derivative _d_(ln_Ra__b_)/_dP_ of _Ra__b_ under selected pressures is plotted in Fig. 4, together with the temperature dependence of _d_(ln_Ra__b_)/_dP_ of monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2.8Cu2O8+, (Ref. 1) at atmospheric pressure. Above about 200 K at pressures lower than 0.5 GPa, the pressure derivative _d_(ln_Ra__b_)/_dP_ is almost independent of temperature. At lower temperature, under a pressure of less than 0.2 GPa, _d_(ln_Ra__b_)/_dP_ increases in good agreement with the expression

\[\left(\frac{d\left(\ln R_{ab} \right)}{dP} \right)_{P = 0} = A + B e^{- T/t}\text{.}\]

At atmospheric pressure \(A\) = -0.085 GPa-1, \(B\) = 1.819 GPa-1, and \(t\) = 44.15 K. The relationship between

\[\left\langle\frac{d\,(\ln R_{ab})}{dP}\right\rangle_{P=0}=1.88\times 10^{-2}-2.6 \times 10^{-4}T,\] (2)

a very weak temperature dependence. Above 0.2 GPa, \(d\)(ln\(R_{ab}\))/\(dP\) varies nonlinearly with temperature. This nonlinearity is enhanced as pressure increases (Fig. 4).

The temperature dependence of \(R_{ab}\) of textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) was found to vary with pressure (Fig. 5), in contrast to monocrystalline Bi\({}_{2.2}\)(Sr,Ca)\({}_{2.8}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) (Fig. 3 in Ref. 1). The temperature derivative \(dR_{ab}/dT\) for the normal-state in-plane resistance of textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\), determined using a linear regression, is plotted in Fig. 6, to show clearly the pressure effects. The temperature derivative \(dR_{ab}/dT\) shows parabolic behavior up to 0.7 GPa.

### Superconducting state

The pressure dependences of the superconducting transition temperature, employing three commonly used conventions, are shown in Fig. 7. The three definitions of \(T_{c}\) are [5, 6] the onset, midpoint, and offset, being the temperatures at 90, 50, and 10 % of the normal-state resistance \(R_{N}\) linearly extrapolated to the transition region. The transition width \(\Delta T_{c}\) then becomes \(T_{c}\)(offset)\(-T_{c}\)(onset). A linear temperature dependence is a common feature of the normal-state electrical resistance of optimally doped high-temperature superconductors and it is found at higher temperatures, from 290 to 193 K, in the textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\). The linear extrapolation of this high-temperature \(R_{ab}\) leads to transition temperatures at atmospheric pressure of \(T_{c}\)(onset)\(=\)108.2\(\pm\)0.2 K, \(T_{c}\)(mid)\(=\)89.9\(\pm\)0.2 K, \(T_{c}\)(offset)\(=\)82.9\(\pm\)0.2 K, and \(\Delta T_{c}\)\(=\)25.3\(\pm\)0.2 K.

The shapes of the \(R\)-\(T\) curve vary with pressure (Figs. 2, 5, and 6), reducing accuracy in determination of the pressure effects on \(T_{c}\)(onset) and \(T_{c}\)(offset). Each \(T_{c}\) value from different definitions increases linearly with pressure. \(T_{c}\)(onset) has the largest rate of increase, while \(T_{c}\)(mid) has the smallest. Linear regression of the pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) gives \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\)\(=\) 5.4\(\pm\) 0.7 KGPa\({}^{-1}\) for \(T_{c}\)(onset), \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\)\(=\) 2.0 \(\pm\) 0.2 KGPa\({}^{-1}\) for \(T_{c}\)(mid) and \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\)\(=\) 3.1\(\pm\) 0.2 KGPa\({}^{-1}\) for \(T_{c}\)(offset). The value of \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\) is similar to most results reported for single-crystalline and polycrystalline Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) (Table II in Ref. 1), but those of \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\) and \(dT_{c}^{\rm diff}/dP\) are larger. The pressure derivative of the transition width \(\Delta T_{c}\) is \(d\)(\(\Delta T_{c}\))/\(dP\)\(=\) 2.2\(\pm\)0.5 KGPa\({}^{-1}\).

An alternative approach is to extrapolate the normal-state resistance \(R_{N}\) immediately above the region where the resistance drops sharply. At atmospheric pressure the \(T_{c}\) values and their pressure derivatives determined in this way are \(T_{c}\)(onset)\(=\)96.1\(\pm\)0.2 K, \(T_{c}\)(mid)\(=\)89.2\(\pm\)0.2 K, \(T_{c}\)(offset) \(=\)82.5\(\pm\)0.2 K, and \(\Delta T_{c}\)\(=\) 13.7\(\pm\)0.2 K. The pressure derivative of \(\Delta T_{c}\) is \(d\)(\(\Delta T_{c}\))/\(dP\)\(=\) -1.1\(\pm\)0.4 KGPa\({}^{-1}\). This value of \(\Delta T_{c}\) is similar to that reported [6] for a Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O sample with a \(T_{c}\) of 90 K. Linear regression of the data obtained in this alternative way gives \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\)\(=\) 1.6\(\pm\) 0.3 KGPa\({}^{-1}\) for \(T_{c}\)(onset), \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\)\(=\) 1.8\(\pm\)0.2 KGPa\({}^{-1}\) for \(T_{c}\)(mid), and \(dT_{c}^{\rm off}/dP\)\(=\) 3.0\(\pm\)0.2 KGPa\({}^{-1}\) for \(T_{c}\)(offset). The value of \(dT_{c}^{\rm on}/dP\) is compatible to that reported by other authors (see Table II in Ref. 1), implying that the influence of the rounding effects on the pressure derivative \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\) have been reduced. The values of \(dT_{c}^{\rm mol}/dP\) and \(dT_{c}^{\rm off}/dP\) are only changed slightly.

Another method used to determine \(T_{c}\) is to choose the temperature at which a cusp, or a maximum, appears in the gradient \(dR/dT\) in the transition region [7, 8]. The transition temperature \(T_{c}^{c}\), with the superscript "\(c\)" indicating the cusp point, determined using this method at atmospheric pressure is 88.7\(\pm\)0.2 K and its pressure derivative \(dT_{c}^{c}/dP\)\(=\) 2.4\(\pm\)0.5

  KGPa-1, larger than that determined by the method in the previous paragraph. Yet another approach9 is to take \(T_{c}\) as the temperature at which a straight line fit of the _R_-_T_ curve of the transition range intercepts with the zero-resistance axis. This gives \(T_{c}^{0} = 82.6\) K and \(dT_{c}^{0}/dP = 3.4 \pm 0.3\) KGPa-1 almost the same as those of \(T_{c}\)(offset) and \(dT_{c}^{0}/dP\) given in the last paragraph. The large value of \(dT_{c}^{\rm eff}/dP\) is caused by the change in the shape of the _R_-_T_ curve in the lower part of the transition region. There is a tail in the _R_-_T_ curve as the electrical resistance approaches zero (Fig. 1). Application of pressure increases the starting temperature of the tail and the flat part of the tail shifts to higher temperature. Thus, the temperature region \(\Delta T_{c}^{\rm off}\) corresponding to 10% \(R_{N}\) under different pressures is broadened, which leads to a large value for \(dT_{c}^{\rm off}/dP\).

Thus the different methods lead to different values of \(T_{c}\). The values of \(T_{c}\) and its pressure derivative, determined in the upper and lower sections of the transition region, can be affected by the shape changes in the _R_-_T_ curve, which are caused by nontransition effects. Specifically, the values of \(T_{c}\)(onset) and the pressure derivatives of \(T_{c}\)(onset) and \(T_{c}\)(offset) are sensitive to the variation of the resistance curve whilst the values of \(T_{c}\)(mid) (89.2 +- 0.2 K) and its pressure derivative \(dT_{c}^{\rm mid}/dP\) (1.8 +- 0.2 KGPa-1) are not. Although \(T_{c}\)(mid) (89.2 +- 0.2 K) determined for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- \(y\) is similar to that (90.3 +- 0.2 K) for monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2SCu2O8+- \(y\),1 the _R_-_T_ curve above the transition range does not show the semiconductorlike behavior of the oxygen-deficient single crystal. In view of this and on the basis of work by Klotz and Schilling,10 textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- \(y\) used here can be considered to be slightly oxygen overdoped.

## IV Discussion and Analysis

### The normal-state resistance

The pressure derivative \(d\ln\rho_{ab}/dP\) (\(=\)\(-\)8.4%\(\pm\)0.2 GPa\({}^{-1}\)) obtained here for textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\,\gamma}\) is similar to that (\(-\)7.5%) of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\,\gamma}\) crystals.[11] Both these values are smaller than those of monocrystalline Bi\({}_{2.2}\)(Sr,Ca)\({}_{2.8}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\,\gamma}\) (\(-\)25.5% GPa\({}^{-1}\)) and Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\,\gamma}\) (\(-\)15.0%) (Ref. [12]) and that (\(-\)11% GPa\({}^{-1}\)) of sintered (BiPb)SrCaCuO.[13] Values of \(-\)8.4 and \(-\)12.0% have been found for two Bi\({}_{2.2}\)Sr\({}_{1.8}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\,\gamma}\) single crystals.[9]

From elementary electron transport theory the volume derivative \(d\ln\rho/d\ln V\) of the normal-state resistivity is given by[1]

\[\frac{d\ \ln\rho}{d\ \ln V} = 2\gamma+B^{T}\frac{d\ \ln\delta}{dP}-\frac{d\ \ln t}{dP}\left(\frac{d\ \ln V}{dP}\right)^{-1}\] (3) \[= 2\gamma+B^{T}\frac{d\ \ln\delta}{dP}-\frac{\beta_{c}}{\beta_{V}}\]

for \(T\)\(>\)\(\Theta\) (the Debye temperature). Here \(\gamma\) is the thermal Gruneisen parameter, \(\delta\) is the mobile charge carrier density, and \(\beta_{V}\) is the isothermal volume compressibility, the reciprocal of the bulk modulus \(B^{T}\). The first term represents the effects from the lattice vibration scattering, the second the effects of the pressure dependence of the mobile charge carrier density, and the third the changes in physical dimensions under pressure. The value of \(d\ \ln\rho_{ab}/d\ \ln V\), estimated using Eq. (3), is only 64% of that measured for monocrystalline

 Bi2,2(Sr,Ca)2,8Cu2O8+, whereas for some Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9 and YBa2Cu3O7-,x single crystals the calculated values are close to those determined experimentally.[1] The mobile charge carrier term contributes about 75% of the estimated \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ lnV for Bi2,2(Sr,Ca)2,8Cu2O8+, and YBa2Cu3O7-x single crystals.[1] Contributions from the third term are negligible for single crystals. Now \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ lnV can be obtained from the measured pressure derivative \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ ln_P_, using

\[\frac{d\ {\rm ln}\rho_{ab}}{d\ {\rm ln}V} = - B^{T}\frac{d\ {\rm ln}\rho_{ab}}{dP}.\]

For textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+, \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ lnV has been obtained as 2.01+-0.06, using the isothermal bulk modulus \(B_{T}\)  _B_S = 31.9 GPa determined by Saunders _et al._[14] for very dense textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9. In general, the elastic stiffnesses of the high-temperature superconducting cuprate ceramics, especially for the bismuth-based materials are small. The elastic stiffnesses of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+, are substantially smaller than those for monocrystalline material. For single-crystal Bi2212, the bulk modulus is about 70 GPa; the reduced stiffness of the textured ceramic is due to the microstructural defects including porosity and granularity.[15] The value obtained for \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ lnV is much smaller than that (18.6) for monocrystalline Bi2,2(Sr,Ca)2,8Cu2O8+, and those 5.47 and 10.95 estimated for two Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9 single crystals.[1]

Taking g = 1.56,[1]\(d\ ln\delta pd\) = 10.8% GPa-1,[16]\(B^{T}\)= 31.9 GPa, and \(b\) = 0.021 GPa-1 for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+, the value of \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ lnV calculated using Eq. (3) is 5.89, much larger than that (2.01+-0.06) determined for textured BiSr2CaCu2O8+,9. If the bulk modulus _B_T_ of 70 GPa for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9 single crystals is used, Eq. (4) gives 4.41 for \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ lnV using the experimentally determined \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ ln_V as 10.0. Hence the small value of \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ ln_V determined for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+, cannot be attributed completely to the small value of its bulk modulus _B_T_. The anomalously small value of \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ ln_V determined for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9 indicates that the volume dependence of the normal-state _ab_-plane resistance due to the lattice vibrational scattering and the pressure dependence of the mobile charge carrier density are smaller than that for single-crystal material.

The Gruneisen parameter g in Eq. (3) is defined by \(-d\ {\rm ln}\Theta/d\ {\rm ln}V\), which is proportional to the reciprocal of the lattice vibrational mean-square amplitude \(\overline{X^{2}}\). Hence g is proportional to \(d\) ln\(\overline{X^{2}}\)/_d_ ln_V_. Part of the reason for the small value found for \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ ln_V_ may lie in a relatively small change of \(\overline{X^{2}}\) under pressure. Ceramic materials contain pores and microcracks which close under pressure,[17, 18, 19] reducing the value of the bulk modulus. The thermal Gruneisen parameter g can be calculated using

\[\gamma = \frac{\alpha B^{S}}{C_{P}\rho_{m}},\]

where \(a\) is the volume thermal expansion coefficient, \(C_{P}\) is the specific heat at constant pressure, and \(r_{m}\) is the mass density. Assuming no significant difference in the ratio _a_/_C__P_ for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9 from that for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9 single crystals, substitution of the values of _B_S (31.86 GPa) and \(r_{m}\) (95% of theoretical mass density) for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9 (Ref. 6) into Eq. (5), gives

\[\frac{\gamma_{\rm eff}}{\gamma} = \frac{B_{s}^{S}\rho_{m}^{\ast}}{B_{s}^{S}\rho_{m}^{\ast}} = 0.48,\]

taking \(B_{s}\) as 70 GPa. Here the subscript \(s\) represents single crystal and \(t\) textured material. Taking g as 1.56, _g_eff is 0.75 for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9. If g_eff is used in Eq. (6) together with \(B_{T}\) = 31.86 GPa and \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ ln_V_ is reduced by 27.5% from 5.89 to 4.27, which is still much larger than that (2.01+-0.06) determined from the measured \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ _PP_. Hence, it is concluded that this discrepancy is not due to defect structure alone.

The pressure dependence of the in-plane resistance is also affected by temperature, particularly when \(T\) < 200 K (Fig. 4). Below 0.4 GPa the pressure derivative \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ _PP_ shows a small linear increase with decreasing temperature between 290 to 200 K, while above 0.4 GPa, it has a slight linear decrease. Information about the temperature dependence of the Gruneisen parameter g is sparse. White[20] has calculated "average values" of g for several high-_T__c_ superconductors from the experimental data. For the Bi-2:2:1:2 system there is almost no change in g from 295 K (g = 1.2) to 100 K (g = 1.3). The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) for polycrystalline Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9 shows no significant change of \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ _PP_ with temperature above 120 K.[16] Hence \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ _PP_ would not be expected to change with temperature significantly in the normal state [Eq. (3)]. However, our results show that below 200 K, the value of \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ _PP_ changes markedly with temperature and its temperature dependence also varies with pressure. These variations in \(d\) ln_r__ab_/_d_ _PP_ below 200 K are considered to be caused by the thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter and the pressure effects on these fluctuations.

### Thermodynamic fluctuations in textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+,9

#### 1.4.1 At ambient pressure

The rounded shape of the _R_-_T_ curve and the deviation from linear, metallic behavior above \(T_{c}\) aroused interest soon after the discovery of the high-_T__c_ superconductors[7, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] and are considered to be caused by thermodynamic fluctuations, intrinsic to superconductors. Due to the short coherence length \(x\) of the order parameter and the high values of \(T_{c}\) , the effects of thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter are particularly pronounced. From studies of the temperature dependence of the resistance it has been suggested that the thermodynamic fluctuations in the _R_-Ba-Cu-O (_R_ = Y or Ho, etc.) materials are three dimensional (3D) (Refs. 22-24) but in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system are two dimensional (2D).[7, 25, 27] A 2D-to-3D crossover in these two systems has been reported.[8, 30, 31] Knowledge of the effects of pressure on the thermodynamic fluctuations is sparse. A pressure study of the excess conductivity of _R_Ba2Cu3O7-, (_R_ = Y, Yb, Gd, and Er) ceramics up to 1.72 GPa has been made,[8] but no explicit conclusion was reported about the pressure effects on the thermodynamic fluctuations. Han, Dai, and Ren[6] measured the electrical resistance  of sintered Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O (_Tc_ = 90 K) under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.7 GPa and concluded that pressure does not seem to change the slope of the \(R\) - \(T\) curve above _Tc_ . However, the present results for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ (Fig. 1) provide a basis for estimation of the pressure effects on the thermodynamic fluctuations.

The excess conductivity D_s_ that causes the reduced resistance and the rounding of the transition includes two contributions: D_s_ = D_s_AL + D_s_MT where (i) D_s_AL is the direct Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contribution,32 attributed to the superconducting pairs created by fluctuations above _Tc_,33 and (ii) D_s_MT is the anomalous, Maki-Thompson (MT) contribution,34-36 arising from the pair-breaking interactions. According to the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory,33 the excess conductivity above _Tc_ from the AL contribution should follow a power law:

\[\Delta\sigma_{\rm AL}(\varepsilon) = Ce^{-x},\]

with

\[C = \frac{e^{2}}{16hd},\quad x = 1\quad{\rm for}\quad 2{\rm D},\]

\[C = \frac{e^{2}}{32h\xi_{\bot,0}},\quad x = \frac{1}{2}\quad{\rm for}\quad 3{\rm D}.\]

Here e=(_T_ - _Tc_)/_Tc_ is the reduced temperature, \(x\) is the critical exponent related to the dimension of the fluctuations. \(C\) is temperature independent and is inversely proportional to the coherence length \(\xi_{\bot,0}\) for 3D fluctuations and to the characteristic thickness \(d\) for a 2D system. By using the formalism of Schmidt37 based on the TDGL theory, Lawrence and Doniach38 derived an expression

\[\Delta\sigma_{\rm LD} = \frac{e^{2}}{16hd}e^{- 1}\left[ {1 + \left[ \frac{2\xi_{\bot,0}}{d} \right]^{2}} \right]^{- 1/2}\]

for the fluctuation-induced in-plane conductivity. For a small interlayer coupling parameter \(a\) =(2_x_l,_g_/_d_)2 the fluctuations are 2D, while for a large one they are 3D. As temperature decreases and approaches _Tc_ the LD approach predicts cross-over of the dimensionality of the fluctuations at a temperature \(T\)0,

\[T_{0} = T_{c}\left[ {1 + \left( {2\xi_{\bot,0}}/d \right)^{2}} \right].\]

The indirect (MT) contribution for the 2D fluctuations can be expressed as32

\[\Delta\sigma_{\rm MT}^{\rm 2D} = \frac{e^{2}}{8hd}\frac{1}{e - \delta}\ln\left( \frac{e}{\delta} \right),\]

where d=(_Tc_o_ - _Tc_)/_Tc_ is the pair-breaking parameter and _Tc_o corresponds to the critical temperature in the absence of pair-breaking mechanisms.

A common approach to the analysis of the AL contribution [Eqs. (7)-(9)] is to extract the slope of a logarithmic plot of the excess conductivity with respect to e. The results are sensitive to the value of _Tc_ and can differ substantially29 because of the uncertainty in the values of _Tc_ determined by different methods. To avoid this problem, the fitting procedure used here has been performed with respect to temperature \(T\), with 290 K as a reference point, rather than e. From Eq. (7) it can be shown that

\[\left\langle \frac{\sigma_{290}}{\Delta\sigma_{\rm AL}} \right\rbrack^{1/\kappa} = \left( \frac{\sigma_{290}}{C} \right)^{1/\kappa} \varepsilon = - \left( \frac{\sigma_{290}}{C} \right)^{1/\kappa} + \left( \frac{\sigma_{290}}{C} \right)^{1/\kappa} \frac{T}{T_{c}}.\]

Hence (_s_290/D_s_AL)1/_k_ is linear with respect to \(T\). The reduced excess conductivity D_s_/_s_290 is calculated from the experimental data as D_s_/_s_290/_R_(_T_) - \(R\)290/_R_N_(_T_). The background resistance \(R_{N}\)(_T_) = \(a\) + _bT_ is extrapolated by fitting the linear part of the measured resistance _R_(_T_) data above 190 K. In Fig. 8(a), (_s_290/D_s_2)2 (_x_ = 1/2) and (_s_290/D_s_2) (_x_ = 1) are plotted against temperature up to 140 and 190 K, respectively, for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ , at atmospheric pressure. Above _Tc_ both (_s_290/D_s_2) and (_s_290/D_s_2)2 increase rapidly as temperature increases. An enlarged scale [Fig. 8(b)] (solid line) shows that in the temperature range _Tc_ + 5 K to _Tc_ + 20 K (i.e., 94.3-110 K) (_s_290/D_s_2) is linearly dependent upon temperature; below 94.3 K, closer to _Tc_, there is a departure from linearity: (_s_290/D_s_2) goes below the straight line. The linear part in the (_s_290/D_s_2)-_T_ curve suggests that there is a 2D-AL contribution. However the linear region in the (_s_290/D_s_2)2-_T_ from about 94-100 K, Fig. 8(b) (dotted line) implies the existence of 3D fluctuations in that temperature range and introduces difficulties in defining the dimensionality of the fluctuations in the temperature region above _Tc_ and below about 100 K. In this situation it is necessary to check the fits; to do this the differences between (_s_290/D_s_2)1/_k_ and the fitted lines are plotted in Fig. 8(c) as a function of temperature for \(x\) = 1/2 and 1, respectively. The difference between (_s_290/D_s_2) and the fitted line is almost equal to zero from about _Tc_ to 115 K: in the region above _Tc_ and below 115 K the fluctuations are characterized by two dimensions. By contrast the difference between (_s_290/D_s_2)2 and its fitted line is close to zero only in the small temperature range from about 94 to 100 K in which the 3D model also fits. Thus the thermodynamic fluctuations probably have 2D character in the textured material.

The characteristic thickness \(d\) and the mean-field critical temperature _Tc_ can be calculated using Eqs. (13) and (18) from the intercept and slope of the linear fit to the (_s_290/D_s_2)-_T_ curve. At atmospheric pressure \(d\) = 4.5 +- 0.2 A and _Tc__m_ = 86.0 +- 0.5 K. It may be noted here that _Tc_ is about 3deg lower than _Tc_(mid) but about 3.5deg higher than _Tc_(offset). This value of \(d\) is similar to that (~6 A) determined39 for a Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ , single crystal, using the 2D-AL approach. If the fluctuations from 94 to 100 K are assumed to have 3D character, as the linearity of (_s_290/D_s_2)2 with temperature \(T\) might suggest, the zero-coherence length \(\xi_{\bot,0}\) estimated using Eqs. (12) and (16) is 1.2 +- 0.1 A, close to those determined for polycrystalline Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ (1.46 A),31 Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ (1.3 A),40 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ (1 A for the extrapolated \(\xi_{\bot,0}\)).41,42

To ascertain whether there is a dimensional crossover of the fluctuations in textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ , the LD approach has been used by fitting Eq. (10) to the reduced excess conductivity (D_s_290/_s_290). A crossover temperature of _Tc_ = 96.1 +- 0.4 K (at atmospheric pressure) is obtained, which is about 7 K higher than _Tc_(mid) and about 4 K lower than the starting temperature of the linear part of the  (\(\sigma_{290}\)/\(\Delta\sigma\))\({}^{2}\)\(-\)\(T\) curve. The characteristic thickness \(d\) and the zero-coherence length \(\xi_{\perp 0}\), determined by fitting Eq. (10), are, respectively, 4.8 \(\pm\)0.2 A, close to that (4.5 \(\pm\)0.2 A) obtained from the linear fit to (\(\sigma_{290}\)/\(\Delta\sigma\)), and 0.67 \(\pm\)0.03 A, smaller than that obtained by using the 3D-AL approach. Recently, Hussy _et al._[43] have estimated \(\xi_{\perp 0}\)\(\sim\)0.5 A for Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\gamma}\). The behavior of (\(\sigma_{290}\)/\(\Delta\sigma\)) with temperature, expected from the LD approach, calculated taking the characteristic thickness \(d\) as 4.8 \(\pm\)0.2 A and the zero-coherence length \(\xi_{\perp 0}\) as 0.67 \(\pm\)0.03 A, is compared with the experimental data in Fig. 9. The line drawn using the LD approach fits the data well from 90 to 110 K. Crossover from 2D to 3D is not clearly defined.

To estimate the indirect (MT) contribution to the thermodynamic fluctuations in textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\gamma}\), Eq. (12) and Eq. (2b) quoted by Gauzzi and Pavuna[29] have been used to fit the excess conductivity from 90 to 120 K. The characteristic thickness \(d\) obtained is about ten times larger (35\(-\)51 A) than those obtained by using the AL and LD approaches. Freitas, Tsuei, and Plaskett[22] and Gauzzi and Pavuna[29] found no MT contribution in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) superconductors in a zero magnetic field. A similar analysis rules out any MT contribution to the thermodynamic fluctuations in textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\gamma}\) in a zero magnetic field.

Analysis of their data for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) films, led Gauzzi and Pavuna[29, 44] to question the validity of the AL and LD approaches for high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates. They concluded that the critical exponent does not exhibit any universal behavior in the fluctuation region accessible to their experiments. Using a generalized AL expression with a short-wavelength cutoff approach, Gauzzi[45] derived relations for the in-plane excess conductivity for the 2D and 3D fluctuations. Gauzzi and Pavuna[29, 44] found that the 3D equation fitted the excess conductivity determined for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) films well. In contrast to a consensus that the thermodynamic fluctuations in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\gamma}\) are characterized by two-dimensional behavior, a fit of Gauzzi's equations to the data obtained here for textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\gamma}\) indicates failure of the 2D equation. However there is a good fit to the measured data from about 120 to 90 K using Gauzzi's 3D equation (Fig. 9). At atmospheric pressure, Gauzzi's 3D approach leads to \(\xi_{\perp 0}\)\(\sim\)0.43 \(\pm\)0.05 A, which is less than those obtained by using the AL (1.2 \(\pm\)0.1 A) and LD (0.67 \(\pm\)0.03 A) approaches, but agrees with the estimate by Hussy _et al.[43]_

#### ii.2.2 Effect of pressure

Application of pressure is found to have a strong influence on the thermodynamic fluctuations in textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\gamma}\). The relative change \(\delta\)(\(\Delta\sigma\)/\(\sigma_{290}\))\({}_{P}\)/ (\(\Delta\sigma\)/\(\sigma_{290}\))\({}_{P}\)= 0 in the reduced excess conductivity is plotted in Fig. 10 as a function of pressure for selected values of \(\ln\)e. There is a minimum at about 0.23 GPa. Well above \(T_{c}\), \(\delta\)(\(\Delta\sigma\)/\(\sigma_{290}\))/(\(\Delta\sigma\)/\(\sigma_{290}\))\({}_{P}\)= 0 increases almost linearly with increasing pressure when \(P\)\(>\)0.23 GPa. The changes in \(\Delta\sigma\)/\(\sigma_{290}\) caused by applying pressure are reduced as \(T\) approaches \(T_{c}\) (\(\ln\)e becomes more negative). When \(\ln\)e\(>\)\(-\)1, the reduced excess conductivity \(\Delta\sigma\)/\(\sigma_{290}\) increases by about 20% at 0.71 GPa. In the context of the AL contribution to the thermodynamic fluctuations, this means that applying pressure enhances the creation of the fluctuation superconducting quasiparticles well above \(T_{c}\) resulting in a larger excess conductivity and the change in the shape of the \(R\)\(\cdot\)\(T\) curve under pressure (Fig. 1). The pressure dependences of the characteristic thickness \(d\), obtained from the 2D-AL and LD approaches, are plotted in Fig. 11(a). Both methods show similar behavior for \(d\): a nonlinear pressure dependence with a maximum at about 0.23 GPa corresponding to the minimum in \(\delta\)(\(\Delta\sigma\)/\(\sigma_{290}\))/(\(\Delta\sigma\)/\(\sigma_{290}\))\({}_{P}\)= 0 (Fig. 10). Therefore, the pressure derivative of \(d\) changes with respect to pressure: 4.7

  \(\pm\)0.9 and 2.6\(\pm\)0.8 A GPa\({}^{1}\) at 0 GPa from the AL and LD approaches, respectively and at 0.71 GPa \(-\)8.4\(\pm\)0.9 and \(-\)3.0\(\pm\)0.8 A GPa\({}^{-1}\). Hence, in textured Bi\({}_{1}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\,y}\) application of pressure appears to have a significant influence on the characteristic thickness \(d\). According to the 2D-AL approach [Eqs. (10) and (11)], the excess conductivity \(\Delta\sigma\) is proportional to the reciprocal of \(d\): when \(d\) increases with pressure, the reduced excess conductivity \(\Delta\sigma/\sigma_{290}\) decreases. Since \(d\) decreases with pressure, \(\Delta\sigma/\sigma_{290}\) increases. The 2D fluctuations are pressure dependent.

If the 3D fluctuations are assumed to exist between 94 and 100 K, the pressure dependence of the zero-coherence length \(\xi_{\perp,0}\) can be obtained by using the 3D-AL, LD, and 3D-Gauzzi approaches, giving the results in Fig. 11(b). Application of pressure induces smaller changes on \(\xi_{\perp,0}\) than on \(d\). The 3D-AL approach indicates that \(\xi_{\perp,0}\) decreases as pressure increases while on the basis of the LD and 3D-Gauzzi approaches it remains almost constant; the pressure derivative (\(d\xi_{\perp,0}^{\perp}/dP\))\({}_{P=0}\) is \(-\)0.3\(\pm\)0.1 A GPa\({}^{-1}\) (AL), 0.01\(\pm\)0.02 A GPa\({}^{-1}\) (LD), and 0.09\(\pm\)0.03 A GPa\({}^{-1}\): possible 3D fluctuations are almost independent of pressure.

#### 3. Pressure effects on the superconducting transition temperature

The pressure derivative \(dT_{c}^{\rm mid}/dP\) of the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{\rm c}\)(mid) (=89.2\(\pm\)0.2 K at 10\({}^{-4}\) GPa) has been determined as 1.8\(\pm\)0.2 K GPa\({}^{-1}\) for textured

 Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) in the range (1.3\(-\)2.4 K GPa\({}^{-1}\)) found for most Bi-2:2:1:2 superconductors with an applied pressure of less than 2 GPa (see Table II in Ref. 1) irrespective of the sample morphology (i.e., single crystal, sintered, or textured) and quality. This implies that in polycrystalline materials \(dT_{c}/dP\) is mainly determined by the intra-granular superconducting state. To compare the experimental results with theoretical predictions, it is necessary to transform the pressure derivative \(dT_{c}/dP\) of the superconducting transitions temperature \(T_{c}\) into the volume derivative using

\[\frac{d\ \ln T_{c}}{d\ \ln V}=-\frac{B^{T}}{T_{c}}\frac{dT_{c}}{dP}.\] (14)

To determine \(d\ \ln T_{c}/d\ \ln V\), a parameter intrinsic to a superconductor, the value of \(B^{T}\) for a single crystal should be used. Using \(B^{T}\)=70 GPa for Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) single crystals,[14] and the values for \(T_{c}\)(mid) and \(dT_{c}^{\rm mid}/dP\), gives \(d\ \ln T_{c}/d\ \ln V\) for textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) = -1.4: close to that (\(-\)1.5) for monocrystalline Bi\({}_{2.2}\)(Sr,Ca)\({}_{2.8}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\). The pressure-induced increase in \(T_{c}\) has been attributed to the volume dependence of the electron-phonon interaction parameter \(\eta\) in the BCS theory or to the volume dependence of the width of the electron band for a 2D square lattice.[1, 46] The value (\(-\)1.4) of \(d\ \ln T_{c}/d\ \ln V\) obtained here for Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) falls between those predicted by the BCS (\(-\)1) and the RVB (\(-\)2) theories,[46] as found previously for monocrystalline Bi\({}_{2.2}\)(Sr,Ca)\({}_{2.8}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\).[1]

### Pressure effects on the weak links between grain boundaries

Thermodynamic fluctuations are not the sole reason for broadening of the resistive transition in a polycrystalline superconductor; other mechanisms which could cause the broadening include thermally activated flux creep and quantum tunnelling.[47] The 'tail structure' in the _R_-_T_ or _I_-_V_ curves in the superconducting transition region is a characteristic of both conventional and high-_T_\({}_{c}\) superconducting materials comprised of grains, such as polycrystalline bulk samples, films and bicrystals.[47-50] Tail structures also occur in Josephson junctions made from high-_T_\({}_{c}\) superconductors[51] and have been attributed to weak links at the grain boundaries.[2]

Information about pressure effects on the weak-link behavior of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+, is now obtained. The _R_-_T_ curves below 100 K for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ and monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2SCu2O8+, at atmospheric pressure and 0.7 GPa are plotted in Fig. 12. The resistance of both materials drops abruptly at the superconducting transition at almost the same temperature. But there are long tails in the _R_-_T_ curves for the textured sample. To quantify the spread of the tailing effects, a temperature _T_\({}_{d}\) indicating the departure from the linear behavior in the superconducting transition region is defined. A linear regression, returned with a relative coefficient better than 0.999, is made in the straight line part of the transition region (dashed lines in Fig. 12). At _T_\({}_{d}\) the intragranular resistance reaches zero and the grain-boundary resistance provides the main contribution. At atmospheric pressure _T_\({}_{d}\) is determined as 86.0 +- 0.5 K, higher than _T_\({}_{c}\)(offset) (82.5 K) determined in Sec. II _T_\({}_{c}\)(offset); its pressure derivative is affected by the tail's pressure dependence.

The resistance tail below _T_\({}_{d}\) has been attributed to the thermal noise in the dc Josephson effect,[52] i.e., the thermally activated phase slippage in the Josephson effect.[51,52] The grain boundaries can be likened phenomenologically to either a sheath of dirty metal or a layer of insulator.[51,53] The bonded superconducting grains could form superconductor-insulator-superconductor (_S_-_I_-_S_) junctions or superconductor-(normal metal)-superconductor (_S_-_N_-_S_) junctions. When \(T\) approaches _T_\({}_{c}\) from low temperatures, the coupling between the phases of the superconducting order parameter of two superconductors forming a Josephson junction is thermally disrupted and the phase difference between the two superconductors slips.[51,52] A nonzero time-averaged voltage proportional to the phase-slip rate results; that corresponding to phase slippage of 2 _p_\(\pi\) is given by[52]

\[\overline{V} = \frac{\pi wh}{e},\]

where _w_-1 is the average time for a phase slippage of 2 \(p\). For high-_T_\({}_{c}\) superconductors the thermally activated phase slippage is present over a rather wide temperature range below _T_\({}_{c}\) (Ref. [51]) due to the depression of the order parameter at the grain boundaries, which is caused by the short coherence length g(0).[54] Therefore a resistance \(R_{p}\) is produced across the Josephson junction by the phase slippage. The ratio of \(R_{p}\) to the normal-state resistance \(R_{n}\) of the junction is given in the Ambegaokar-Halperin (AH) model[52] by

\[\frac{R_{p}}{R_{jn}} = \left[ I_{0}\left| \frac{\gamma_{0}}{2} \right| \right]^{- 2}.\]

Here \(I\)0 is a modified Bessel function and

\[\gamma_{n} \propto I_{c}(T)\]

is the normalized barrier height for the thermally activated phase slip, with \(I_{c}\)(_T_) being the critical current. Assuming that \(I_{c}\)(_T_)  (1 - _T__f__c_)_n_ (Ref. [51]) then

\[\gamma_{0} = D\left( 1 - \frac{T}{T_{c}} \right)^{n}.\] Fits of Eq. (16) to the normalized resistance \(R_{p}/R_{jn}\) measured under selected pressures, with \(D\) and \(n\) being the free parameters, are shown in Fig. 13: the fitted lines have been calculated with \(n\!=\!2\) and \(T_{c}\) determined at each pressure (see Sec. II). The \(T_{c}\) values used to determine the best value of \(D\) for the selected pressures are presented in Table I, together with the phase slippage starting temperature \(T_{d}\) . According to the theory for granular superconductors, a value of 2 for the exponent \(n\) would correspond to an \(S\)-\(N\)-\(S\) junction.[55, 56] However, the nature of a Josephson junction in high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors is still controversial. According to the Ambegaokar-Baratoff (AB) theory, the critical current density \(j_{c}\!\propto\!(1\!-\!TT_{c})\) for a \(S\)-\(I\)-\(S\) junction, while for a \(S\)-\(N\)-\(S\) junction \(j_{c}\!\propto\!(1\!-\!T/T_{c})^{2}\).[56, 57, 58] In studies of the transport properties of high-\(T_{c}\) granular tapes, Okada, Tanaka, and Kamo[59] observed that the temperature dependence of the critical current density \(j_{c}\) of a Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) tape with a silver sheath obeyed the granular \(S\)-\(N\)-\(S\) theory. However, analysis of the critical current density in granular Bi(Pb)-Ca-Sr-Cu-O films indicated \(S\)-\(I\)-\(S\)-type behavior for the 2:2:1:2 phase but \(S\)-\(N\)-\(S\) type for the 2:2:3:2 phase; for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) films that the junction type could be \(S\)-\(I\)-\(S\) or \(S\)-\(N\)-\(S\) depending on the manufacturing procedure.[56] Deutscher and Muller[54] noted that in high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors the short coherence length \(\xi\!(0)\) causes the superconducting order parameter to be depressed at the interface and surface, and that at temperatures close to \(T_{c}\) the decay length of the superconducting wave function in both the insulating and the normal metallic regions is of the order of \(\xi\!(0)\). As a result \(j_{c}\!\propto\!(1\!-\!T/T_{c})^{2}\) in both the \(S\)-\(I\)-\(S\) and \(S\)-\(N\)-\(S\) junctions.[51]

Squares, the measured data; lines, AH-model fits with different values for the parameter \(D\). (a) \(P\!=\!10^{-4}\) GPa. Dashed line, \(D\!=\!300\); solid line, \(D\!=\!400\); dotted line, \(D\!=\!500\). (b) \(P\!=\!0.71\) GPa. Dashed line, \(D\!=\!400\); solid line, \(D\!=\!500\); dotted line, \(D\!=\!550\).

  Considering the energy gap depression in the AB theory, the temperature dependence of the critical current \(I_{c}\) near \(T_{c}\) can be expressed as [51]

\[I_{c}(T) = \frac{\pi\Delta_{j}^{2}(0)}{4\epsilon R_{jn}k_{B}T_{c}}\left(1-\frac{T} {T_{c}}\right)^{2},\]

where \(\Delta_{j}(0)\) is the energy gap at the interface of the junction at \(T\) = 0 K. By considering Eqs. (17) and (18) and keeping in mind that \(D\)is a temperature-independent fitting parameter, we may assume

\[D \propto \frac{\Delta_{j}^{2}(0)}{R_{jn}T_{c}}.\]

Hence a relationship between the pressure derivative of the coefficient \(D\) and the energy gap can be derived as

\[\frac{d\ \ln D}{dP} = 2\,\frac{d\ \ln\Delta_{j}(0)}{dP} - \frac{d\ \ln R_{jn}}{dP} - \frac{d\ \ln T_{c}}{dP}\]

Therefore, the pressure derivative of the in-plane \(\Delta_{j}(0)\) can be estimated for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- . Using the data for \(R_{jn}\) (Table I), \(d\ \ln R_{jn}/dP\) has been estimated as 0.087 \(\pm\)0.043 GPa-1 and \(d\ \ln D/dP\) as 0.31\(\pm\)0.01 GPa-1. Substitution of these values and 0.02\(\pm\)0.01 GPa-1 for \(d\ \ln T_{c}^{\rm mid}/dP\) into Eq. (21) yields \(d\ \ln\Delta_{j}(0)/dP\) = 0.12\(\pm\)0.02 GPa-1, showing how the width of the in-plane energy gap at the interface of the junction increases with increasing pressure. This accounts for the shift of the tail structure in the _R-T_ curve under pressure. With a wider energy gap the barrier height for the thermally activated phase slip is higher. Since a higher thermal energy is required for the phase slip to occur, the resistance \(R_{p}\) produced by the phase slippage at temperatures below \(T_{d}\) decreases with increasing pressure. The resistance tail shifts to higher temperatures accordingly. This is the reason why the pressure derivative \(dT_{c}^{\rm off}/dP\) of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- , is larger than that of monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr2Ca)2sCu2O8+- . The decrease in \(R_{p}\) results in an increase in critical current between the grains. Hence grain-boundary linkage is enhanced by pressure. A relationship obtained [51] from the AH model and the AB expression [Eq. (22)],

\[\frac{\Delta T}{T_{c}} \propto \frac{k_{B}T_{c}\sqrt{R_{jn}}}{2\Delta_{j}(0)}\]

can be used to check the assumptions used to obtain Eq. (21); \(\Delta T\) is the superconducting transition width. Using Eq. (22) it can be shown that

\[\frac{d\ \ln\Delta_{j}(0)}{dP} = \frac{1}{2}\,\frac{d\ \ln R_{jn}}{dP} + 2\,\frac{d\ \ln T_{c}}{dP} - \frac{d\ \ln\Delta T}{dP}.\]

In this work \(d\ \ln\Delta T/dP\) = 0.08 \(\pm\) 0.03 GPa-1 is obtained from the pressure dependence of \(\Delta T_{c}\)(mid). From Eq. (23) and the results for \(d\ \ln T_{c}^{\rm mid}/dP\) and \(d\ \ln R_{jn}/dP\), we have obtained \(d\ \ln\Delta_{j}(0)/dP\) = 0.08 \(\pm\) 0.05 GPa-1, in reasonable accord with the value (0.12\(\pm\)0.05 GPa-1) obtained using Eq. (21).

The values (400\(\pm\)0.500) of the coefficient \(D\) determined for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- , are smaller than those determined for YBa2Cu2O7- . materials. The study of a YBa2Cu2O7-  grain-boundary Josephson junction provided a value of 1350 for \(D\). [51] From work on transport properties of epitaxial YBa2Cu2O7-  films, Friedl _et al._[60] obtained 800 for \(D\). Wang [50] quoted a \(D\) of 1550 obtained from work on a YBa2Cu2O7- .b bicrystal Josephson junction. Equation (20) indicates that \(D\) is proportional to \(\Delta_{j}^{2}(0)\) and the reciprocal of the product \(R_{jn}\) and \(T_{c}\). In the present work, the value of \(T_{c}\) used is similar to those of the YBa2Cu2O7- .b materials, while that of \(R_{jn}\) (\(\approx\)15 m\(\Omega\) at atmospheric pressure) is much smaller than those (1\(-\)7.5\(\Omega\)) of the YBa2Cu2O7- .b materials. [50] This implies that the value of \(\Delta_{j}(0)\) for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+-  is 10 times smaller than that of YBa2Cu2O7- .b

## V Conclusions

Measurements of the pressure dependence of the in-plane normal-state resistance of a textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- , high-\(T_{c}\) superconductor have been made and compared with those previously reported for monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2sCu2O8+- .1 While a number of properties are common to both types of material, others are characteristics of the granularity of polycrystalline superconductors.

(1) The pressure derivative \(d\ \ln\rho_{ab}/dP\) of the normal-state in-plane resistivity of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+-  is \(-\)8.4%\(\pm\)0.2 GPa-1, similar to that reported for some Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- , single crystals but much smaller than that (\(-\)25.5%\(\pm\)0.2 GPa-1) of monocrystalline Bi2.2(Sr,Ca)2sCu2O8+- .1 The volume derivative \(d\ \ln R_{ab}/d\ \ln V\) of the normal-state resistance of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- (2.01\(\pm\)0.06) is much smaller than that for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- , single crystals. Part of the reason for this small value is that the pores or cracks in this ceramic material reduce the influence of pressure on the mean-square lattice vibrational amplitude \(\overline{X^{2}}\), and therefore reduce the effective Gruneisen parameter \(\gamma_{\rm eff}\).

(2) A temperature dependence of \(d\ \ln R_{ab}/dP\) found for textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- , since, especially below 200 K, is caused by thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter and is affected by pressure (Fig. 4).

(3) The temperature derivative \(d\ \ln R_{ab}/dT\) extracted from the linear part of the _R-T_ curve between 190 and 290 K is pressure dependent and has a minimum at 0.4 GPa.

(4) The pressure derivatives \(dT_{c}/dP\) of the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) are determined as 1.6\(\pm\)0.3, 1.8 \(\pm\)0.2, and 3.0\(\pm\)0.2 K GPa-1 at the onset, midpoint, and offset of the _R-T_ curve in the transition region, respectively. For textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- , thermodynamic fluctuations influence the pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\)(onset). The pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\)(offset) is affected by weak links across grain boundaries whilst the pressure derivative of \(T_{c}\)(mid) is unaffected by these effects. The pressure derivative \(dT_{c}^{\rm mid}/dP\) falls in the range measured for most Bi-2:2:1:2 superconductors: in polycrystalline materials \(dT_{c}/dP\) is mainly determined by the intragranular superconducting state, and its value is unaffected by the interactions between grain boundaries under pressure.

(5) A value of \(-\)1.4 has been obtained for the volume derivative \(d\ \ln T_{c}/d\ \ln V\) of textured Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+- . This result confirms the previous finding that the value of \(d\ \ln T_{c}/d\ \ln V\) for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+-  is between the values predicted by the BCS (\(-\)1) and the RVB (\(-\)2) theories.

  (6) The effects of hydrostatic pressure on thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting parameter of textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) have been investigated. An analysis based on the AL approach shows that the fluctuations have two-dimensional character between \(T_{c}\) and 115 K. However, there is an ambiguity in the dimensionality from 94 to 100 K, which may caused by the inhomogeneities or disorder of the textured material. Applying hydrostatic pressure enhances the thermodynamic fluctuations. At temperatures when \(\ln\)e\(>\)\(-\)1 the reduced excess conductivity \(\Delta\sigma(\varepsilon)/\sigma_{290}\) increases by about 20% at 0.71 GPa. As pressure is increased the characteristic thickness \(d\) of the 2D system changes non-linearly. The value of \(d\) is reduced by about 20% at a pressure of 0.71 GPa.

(7) Study of the effects of weak links across the grain boundaries on the resistance in textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) shows that the Ambegaokar-Halperin (AH) model fits the reduced temperature dependence of the normalized resistance \(R_{p}/R_{jn}\) in the tail region of the \(R\)-\(T\) curve. The junctions formed by the superconducting grains and grain boundaries are \(S\)-\(N\)-\(S\)-like with \(I_{c}(T)\)\(\propto\)(1-\(TT_{c})^{2}\). Under hydrostatic pressure the temperature \(T_{d}\), at which a tail structure in the \(R\)-\(T\) curve starts, increases and the tail structure shifts to higher temperatures. By using the AH model and the Ambegaokar-Baratoff (AB) expression for the critical current,[51] the pressure derivative \(d\ln\Delta_{j}(0)/dP\) of the energy gap \(\Delta_{j}(0)\) at grain boundaries has been estimated as 0.12\(\pm\)0.02 GPa\({}^{-1}\), i.e., the energy gap increases under pressure. Hence under pressure the potential barrier for the thermally activated phase slip of the superconducting parameter between grains gets higher and the resistance \(R_{p}\) produced by the phase slippage at temperatures below \(T_{d}\) decreases with increasing pressure, which results in the shift of the tail structure. The intergrain critical current increases under pressure. The value of \(\Delta_{j}(0)\) for textured Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+y}\) is about 10 times smaller than that of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\phi}\)
