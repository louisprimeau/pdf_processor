The structural and electric properties of {\bf Y}_{0.6}{\bf Pr}_{0.4}{\bf Ba}_{2-x}{\bf Sr}_{x}{\bf Cu}_{3}{\bf O}_{7-b} have been investigated as a function of x. X-ray powder-diffraction patterns indicate that a solid solution forms with x extending to about 1.4. It is found that the substitution of Sr for Ba results in a contraction in the c axis at the same rate as in {\bf YBa}_{2-x}{\bf Sr}_{x}{\bf Cu}_{3}{\bf O}_{7-b}. The oxygen content and T_{c} are found to remain essentially unchanged with increasing Sr. Our analysis suggests that the contraction in c arises mainly from the shift of the apical oxygen and from a shift of Ba(Sr) towards the CuO_{2} planes. The apparent shift of the apical oxygen does not seem to influence the hybridization between the Pr 4f electrons and the valence band of the CuO_{2} planes significantly. The hybridization is more sensitive to the bond length between the Pr and the oxygen located in the CuO_{2} planes. T_{c} in this system appears to be controlled both by the shift of the apical oxygen and by the hybridization.

Many experimental studies have been undertaken to clarify the mechanism responsible for the non-superconductivity of {\rm PrBa}_{2}{\bf Cu}_{3}{\bf O}_{7-b}. Studies on {\bf Y}_{1-x}{\bf Pr}_{x}{\bf Ba}_{2}{\bf Cu}_{2}{\bf O}_{7-b} indicate that T_{c} is depressed rapidly with increasing x and that T_{c} goes to zero for {\bf x}_{cr}{\rm\approx}0.55.^{1-3} The valence of the Pr ions inferred from magnetic measurements,^{4,5} Hall effect,^{5} chemical substitution,^{6} and muon-spin resonance^{7}\langle_t_SR\rangle is greater than +3 and possibly close to +4, implying that the depression of T_{c} results from hole filling in the CuO_{2} sheets. On the other hand, Raman spectroscopy,^{8} x-ray absorption,^{9,10} electron energy-loss spectroscopy,^{11} and inelastic neutron scattering^{12} indicate that the valence of the Pr ions is close to +3.^{13,14} The depression of T_{c} with increasing Pr was attributed to the enhanced hybridization between Pr 4f electrons and the CuO_{2} valence band. Chemical substitution studies on R_{1-x}{\bf Pr}_{x}{\bf Ba}_{2}{\bf Cu}_{3}{\bf O}_{7-b} (Refs. 15-17) (where R is a rare earth) support this argument.

Though the hybridization mechanism seems plausible as an explanation of the depression of T_{c}, it remains unclear why 4f^{2} electrons of {\bf Pr}^{3+} can interact with the conduction carriers of the CuO_{2} planes in R-123 compounds while {\rm Nd}^{3+}(f^{3}) (immediately next to Pr in the Periodic Table) with a slightly smaller radius does not. Investigation of the superconducting {\rm TlSr}_{2}({\bf Pr},{\bf Ca}){\bf Cu}_{2}{\bf O}_{7-b},^{16}{\rm Pr}_{1.85}{\bf Ce}_{0.15}{\bf CuO}_{4},^{17} and {\rm Bi}_{2}{\bf Sr}_{2}{\bf Ca}_{1-x}{\bf Pr}_{x}{\bf Cu}_{2}{\bf O}_{8+b} (Refs. 18 and 19) systems indicated that {\rm Pr}^{+3} behaves just like other R^{+3} in these systems; no sign of hybridization effect has been observed. A careful structural examination of {\rm RBa}_{2}{\bf Cu}_{3}{\bf O}_{7-b} (Ref. 20) reveals that {\rm PrBa}_{2}{\bf Cu}_{3}{\bf O}_{7-b} is strictly isostructural with other superconducting R-123 compounds. The sole structural anomaly attributable to the presence of {\rm Pr}^{+3} in the R-123 structure is a next-nearest-neighbor effect--an unusually short bond length between the in-plane copper and the apical oxygen, O(4) [2q\,(0,0,z)]. The role of the apical oxygen in determining the electronic properties has been reported in Y-123.^{21-23} A high-resolution neutron powder-diffraction study of {\rm YBa}_{2}{\bf Cu}_{3}{\bf O}_{6-b} (Ref. 24) revealed a discontinuous shift of about 0.02 A of the apical oxygen towards the CuO_{2} sheets as the compound is heated through T_{c} into the nonsuperconducting temperature region. Hence the enhanced hybridization of {\rm PrBa}_{2}{\bf Cu}_{3}{\bf O}_{7} may arise from its unusually short apical Cu-O bond distance.

To verify this hypothesis a doped 123 system may be designed, so that the apical oxygen can shift along the c axis, while {\rm Pr}^{3+} ions partially occupy the sites of R^{3+} and the R-123 structure remains. Such a system can allow us to study the effect of the apical oxygen on the hybridization as it shifts along the c axis. Previous stud ies^{25-27} on YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} indicate that a solid solution forms with a solubility limit near x=1.25, and that T_{c} decreases linearly with x. Anisotropic contractions of the lattice constants were also observed. Extended x-ray-absorption fine structure (EXAFS),^{28} neutron diffraction,^{29,30} and Raman scattering^{30,31} have revealed that the contraction in the c axis results mainly from the rapid decrease in bond distance of Cu(2)-O(4) i.e., O(4) is displaced towards the CuO_{2} planes with increasing Sr. It seemed that the Sr-doped (Y,Pr)Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} system would be a useful system to study the role of the apical oxygen in hybridization. Since the T_{c} of Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is about 40 K, which allows us to observe its variations easily with Sr doping, we set the Pr-doping level at 0.4 in the present study.

In this paper we present structural and electrical properties of a series of Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} samples as a function of the Sr-doping level, x. We show that the shift of the apical oxygen towards the CuO_{2} planes does not seem to influence the hybridization between Pr 4f electrons with the valence band of the CuO_{2} sheets significantly in the present system.

A series of Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} samples with x=0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 were prepared by solid-state reaction of appropriate mixtures of high purity of Pr_{6}O_{11}, Y_{2}O_{3}, SrCO_{3}, and CuO. The powders were mixed, ground, and fired at 900 degC for 12 h in air. Two or three additional firings at 24 h intervals with intermediate grindings were performed before the samples were pressed into pellets. The pellets were then calcined at an elevated temperature, ranging from 930 to 970 degC with increasing Sr-doping levels. Phase identification and the measurement of lattice constants were performed on a MAC Science automatic diffractometer using Cu K\alpha radiation at room temperature. High-purity Si was added to the samples as an internal standard to correct the positions of the diffraction lines. The lattice parameters were then calculated using a standard least-squares method. The electrical resistivity vs temperature was measured on rectangular bars cut from the sintered pellets employing the standard dc four-probe technique. The ac susceptibility was measured by an induction method. Data were collected from 300 down to 4.3 K. The oxygen content for all samples was measured by iodometric titration. Spectral-purity CuO was used as a standard. The measurement error is estimated to be less than 0.3%.

  volume decreases with increasing x. However, the contractions of the cell parameters are anisotropic. The parameter c shows a linear decrease with a slope of about 0.13 A/Sr atom. This value is identical with that observed in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}.[25, 29] The result suggests that Sr ions indeed enter the unit cell and replace Ba ions. The variations of the cell parameters a,b, with x in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} are still controversial. Some researchers[29, 30, 31] reported that the substitution of Sr for Ba results in linear decreases for both a and b, without any tendency towards tetragonalization. But others[25, 27] argued that b has a more rapid decreasing rate than a, leading to tetragonalization with increasing Sr. The disagreement may be due to the difference in synthesizing conditions. Nevertheless, the reported variations of T_{c} with x are similar, i.e., a linear decrease with a slope of about 10 K/Sr atom, so that any phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal that may occur does not have a significant effect on T_{c}. In the present system we found that the parameter b decreases from 3.895(1) A (x=0) to 3.834(2) A (x=1.4), while a varies nonmonotonically by a small amount. At about x=1.0, a and b become equal, indicating a phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal.

One striking feature in Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} is that T_{c} varies in a different way from YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}, where T_{c} is lowered with a rate of about 10 K/Sr atom with increasing Sr. Shown in Fig. 3 is the variation of T_{c} vs x for Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}, where T_{c} is defined as the temperature at which the resistivity corresponds to 50% of the extrapolated normal-state value while the transition width, indicated by vertical bars, is defined as the temperature difference between the 90 and 10 % values. The variation of T_{c} over the entire compositional region from x=0.0 to 1.6 is within 8 K. Superconductivity continues to be observed until x reaches 1.8, with T_{c} as high as 44 K. Further substitution of Sr for Ba results in multiphases and a larger transition width, but T_{c} stays unchanged. This means that T_{c} does not decrease monotonically with doping Sr in the present system. In Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}, no obvious cusp is observed in the T_{c}-x curves similar to that reported in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}.[27] The variation of oxygen content, n, vs x for Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} is shown in Fig. 4. Fitting n vs x yields the equation n=6.86+0.03x. The value of the slope (0.03) is zero within the measuring error, showing that the oxygen content does not change with Sr doping in our specimens and that the variation of T_{c} cannot be associated with the change in n.

The results presented above show that Sr has a wide solid solubility range extending to about x=1.4 in Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}, over which T_{c} does not decrease, unlike the case of YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}. Moreover, based on neutron diffraction and Raman measurement, Kakihana _et al.[30]_ inferred that the substitution of Sr for Ba does not cause a redistribution of charge between the planes and the chains in Sr-doped Y-123. The same conclusion should also be applicable to the present system. We discuss two possible mechanisms with opposite effects on T_{c}: a shift of the apical oxygen toward the CuO_{2} sheets due to direct substitution of Sr for Ba, and an increase in Pr-O bond distance due to a leveling off in the corrugation of the CuO_{2} sheets. We argue that the same contraction rate and the solid solubility in Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} and YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} suggest uneven contraction along the c axis for both systems. This means that the c axis contraction in the former system would result mainly from the shift of the Ba(Sr)-O sheets towards the CuO_{2} sheets, as is the case with the latter system. This is easily understood since Y(Pr) is the next-nearest ion to the Sr(Ba) ion and since the contraction in the c direction takes place between the plane and the chain, while the distance between planes is left unchanged in the Pr-free system.[28, 30] Partial substitution of Pr for Y should therefore not disturb the uneven contraction along the c axis due to the substitution of Sr for Ba. The shift of the apical oxygen towards the CuO_{2} planes will bring about a strong interaction between the apical oxygen and the valence band of CuO_{2} planes, leading to an increase of the Cu 3d_{x^{2}} component in the Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} bond or decreased splitting of Cu 3d_{x^{2}} and Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbitals if the crystal-field effect is considered.[32] These effects cause T_{c} to decrease, as observed in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}. On the other hand, Raman measurement[31] and neutron diffraction[29] indicate that the Y-O bond distance can increase slightly with substitution of Sr for Ba in Y-123. The increase in the Y-O bond distance may arise from the leveling off in the corrugation of the CuO_{2} sheets since the ionic radius of Sr is smaller than that of Ba. A similar situation is expected for (Y,Pr)-123 upon Sr substitution for Ba. Since the hybridization is a strong inverse function of the interatomic spacing,[32, 33] the increase in the Y(Pr)-O bond distance will undoubtedly weaken the hybridization between the Pr 4f electrons and Cu 3d-O 2p valence band, and subsequently lead to an increase in T_{c}. It seems that the effects

 on T_{c} of the weakening hybridization and of the shift of apical oxygen counteract each other so as to prevent any significant change in T_{c}.

In view of the above argument we are led to suggest that the shift of the apical oxygen seems to have no significant effect on the hybridization, i.e., it does not make it stronger, as might be expected. However, the hybridization seems more sensitive to the Pr-O bond distance. This conclusion agrees well with the work by Neumeier _et al._[34] They found that the T_{c} of Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-8} shows a rapid decrease with pressure with an initial slope of -0.21 K/kbar. Other studies, such as chemical substitution [15]^{-}[17] and resonant photoemission spectroscopy,[35] strongly support this conclusion. At this stage, however, the origin of the hybridization between Pr 4f electrons and a Cu 3_d_-O 2p valence band is still unclear. From the present study we may infer that the unusual axial distance between Cu and the apical oxygen in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-8} has no direct relation to the hybridization.

In conclusion, the substitution of Sr for Ba in the Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-6} results in a solid solution with x extending to about 1.4. The parameter c decreases with a slope of 0.13 A/Sr atom at the same rate as in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-8}. This would seem to imply that the contraction of the c axis results from the shift of the apical oxygen and of the Ba(Sr) ions towards the CuO_{2} planes. The shift of the apical oxygen and the weakening hybridization have opposite effects on T_{c}, and, in fact, no large change is observed. The shift of the apical oxygen towards the CuO_{2} planes does not seem to have any significant effect on the hybridization. The hybridization seems more sensitive to the bond distance between Pr and O in the CuO_{2} planes.

The electrical resistivity vs temperature was measured on rectangular bars cut from the sintered pellets employing the standard dc four-probe technique. The ac susceptibility was measured by an induction method. Data were collected from 300 down to 4.3 K. The oxygen content for all samples was measured by iodometric titration. Spectral-purity CuO was used as a standard. The measurement error is estimated to be less than 0.3%.

  volume decreases with increasing x. However, the contractions of the cell parameters are anisotropic. The parameter c shows a linear decrease with a slope of about 0.13 A/Sr atom. This value is identical with that observed in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}.[25, 29] The result suggests that Sr ions indeed enter the unit cell and replace Ba ions. The variations of the cell parameters a,b, with x in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} are still controversial. Some researchers[29, 30, 31] reported that the substitution of Sr for Ba results in linear decreases for both a and b, without any tendency towards tetragonalization. But others[25, 27] argued that b has a more rapid decreasing rate than a, leading to tetragonalization with increasing Sr. The disagreement may be due to the difference in synthesizing conditions. Nevertheless, the reported variations of T_{c} with x are similar, i.e., a linear decrease with a slope of about 10 K/Sr atom, so that any phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal that may occur does not have a significant effect on T_{c}. In the present system we found that the parameter b decreases from 3.895(1) A (x=0) to 3.834(2) A (x=1.4), while a varies nonmonotonically by a small amount. At about x=1.0, a and b become equal, indicating a phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal.

One striking feature in Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} is that T_{c} varies in a different way from YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}, where T_{c} is lowered with a rate of about 10 K/Sr atom with increasing Sr. Shown in Fig. 3 is the variation of T_{c} vs x for Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}, where T_{c} is defined as the temperature at which the resistivity corresponds to 50% of the extrapolated normal-state value while the transition width, indicated by vertical bars, is defined as the temperature difference between the 90 and 10 % values. The variation of T_{c} over the entire compositional region from x=0.0 to 1.6 is within 8 K. Superconductivity continues to be observed until x reaches 1.8, with T_{c} as high as 44 K. Further substitution of Sr for Ba results in multiphases and a larger transition width, but T_{c} stays unchanged. This means that T_{c} does not decrease monotonically with doping Sr in the present system. In Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}, no obvious cusp is observed in the T_{c}-x curves similar to that reported in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}.[27] The variation of oxygen content, n, vs x for Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} is shown in Fig. 4. Fitting n vs x yields the equation n=6.86+0.03x. The value of the slope (0.03) is zero within the measuring error, showing that the oxygen content does not change with Sr doping in our specimens and that the variation of T_{c} cannot be associated with the change in n.

The results presented above show that Sr has a wide solid solubility range extending to about x=1.4 in Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}, over which T_{c} does not decrease, unlike the case of YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}. Moreover, based on neutron diffraction and Raman measurement, Kakihana _et al.[30]_ inferred that the substitution of Sr for Ba does not cause a redistribution of charge between the planes and the chains in Sr-doped Y-123. The same conclusion should also be applicable to the present system. We discuss two possible mechanisms with opposite effects on T_{c}: a shift of the apical oxygen toward the CuO_{2} sheets due to direct substitution of Sr for Ba, and an increase in Pr-O bond distance due to a leveling off in the corrugation of the CuO_{2} sheets. We argue that the same contraction rate and the solid solubility in Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} and YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b} suggest uneven contraction along the c axis for both systems. This means that the c axis contraction in the former system would result mainly from the shift of the Ba(Sr)-O sheets towards the CuO_{2} sheets, as is the case with the latter system. This is easily understood since Y(Pr) is the next-nearest ion to the Sr(Ba) ion and since the contraction in the c direction takes place between the plane and the chain, while the distance between planes is left unchanged in the Pr-free system.[28, 30] Partial substitution of Pr for Y should therefore not disturb the uneven contraction along the c axis due to the substitution of Sr for Ba. The shift of the apical oxygen towards the CuO_{2} planes will bring about a strong interaction between the apical oxygen and the valence band of CuO_{2} planes, leading to an increase of the Cu 3d_{x^{2}} component in the Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} bond or decreased splitting of Cu 3d_{x^{2}} and Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} orbitals if the crystal-field effect is considered.[32] These effects cause T_{c} to decrease, as observed in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-b}. On the other hand, Raman measurement[31] and neutron diffraction[29] indicate that the Y-O bond distance can increase slightly with substitution of Sr for Ba in Y-123. The increase in the Y-O bond distance may arise from the leveling off in the corrugation of the CuO_{2} sheets since the ionic radius of Sr is smaller than that of Ba. A similar situation is expected for (Y,Pr)-123 upon Sr substitution for Ba. Since the hybridization is a strong inverse function of the interatomic spacing,[32, 33] the increase in the Y(Pr)-O bond distance will undoubtedly weaken the hybridization between the Pr 4f electrons and Cu 3d-O 2p valence band, and subsequently lead to an increase in T_{c}. It seems that the effects

 on T_{c} of the weakening hybridization and of the shift of apical oxygen counteract each other so as to prevent any significant change in T_{c}.

In view of the above argument we are led to suggest that the shift of the apical oxygen seems to have no significant effect on the hybridization, i.e., it does not make it stronger, as might be expected. However, the hybridization seems more sensitive to the Pr-O bond distance. This conclusion agrees well with the work by Neumeier _et al._[34] They found that the T_{c} of Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-8} shows a rapid decrease with pressure with an initial slope of -0.21 K/kbar. Other studies, such as chemical substitution [15]^{-}[17] and resonant photoemission spectroscopy,[35] strongly support this conclusion. At this stage, however, the origin of the hybridization between Pr 4f electrons and a Cu 3_d_-O 2p valence band is still unclear. From the present study we may infer that the unusual axial distance between Cu and the apical oxygen in PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-8} has no direct relation to the hybridization.

In conclusion, the substitution of Sr for Ba in the Y_{0.6}Pr_{0.4}Ba_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-6} results in a solid solution with x extending to about 1.4. The parameter c decreases with a slope of 0.13 A/Sr atom at the same rate as in YBa_{2-x}Sr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{7-8}. This would seem to imply that the contraction of the c axis results from the shift of the apical oxygen and of the Ba(Sr) ions towards the CuO_{2} planes. The shift of the apical oxygen and the weakening hybridization have opposite effects on T_{c}, and, in fact, no large change is observed. The shift of the apical oxygen towards the CuO_{2} planes does not seem to have any significant effect on the hybridization. The hybridization seems more sensitive to the bond distance between Pr and O in the CuO_{2} planes.
