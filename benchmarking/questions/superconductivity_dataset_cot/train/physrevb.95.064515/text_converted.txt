###### Abstract

We have studied the effect of Se substitution on Eu valence in a layered
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex superconductor using a combined analysis of x-ray
absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Eu L₃-edge XANES spectra reveal that Eu
is in the mixed valence state with coexisting Eu²⁺ and Eu³⁺. The average
Eu valence decreases sharply from ∼2.3 for x = 0.0 to ∼2.1 for x = 0.4.
Consistently, Eu 3d XPS shows a clear decrease in the average valence by
Se substitution. Bi 4f XPS indicates that effective charge carriers in
the BiCh2 (Ch = S, Se) layers are slightly increased by Se substitution.
On the basis of the present results it has been discussed that the
metallic character induced by Se substitution in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex is
likely to be due to increased in-plane orbital overlap driven by reduced
in-plane disorder that affects the carrier mobility.

## 1 Introduction

Bismuth-based layered dichalcogenides have been drawing a large amount
of attention due to their superconducting and thermoelectric properties
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Indeed, soon after the discovery of superconductivity in
BiS2-based systems [1, 2], it was realized that not only do these
materials have great potential in the field of new superconductors [3]
but also they are likely candidates for materials with tunable
thermoelectric properties [4] due to their low resistivity and low
thermal conductivity [5]. The crystal structure of these materials is
based on alternate stacking of electronically conducting BiS2 layers and
insulating block layers resembling that of CuO2-based and FeAs/Se-based
superconductors [6, 7]. The parent phases of these dichalcogenides are
semiconducting [1, 8, 9], and they become metallic, followed by
superconductivity at low temperature, when electrons are doped in the
BiS2 layers with the dominant orbitals for the electron conduction being
Bi 6p_(x, y). The doped systems show a wide range of superconducting
transition temperature T_(c) with a maximum of ∼10 K in the
LaO1-xFe3BiS2 compound [3]. On the other hand, a relatively high
thermoelectric performance (given by the dimensionless parameter
ZT = S²T/ρκ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, ρ is resistivity, and κ
is thermal conductivity) has been found in the LaOBiS2-xSex system
(ZT ∼ 0.36 for LaOBiSSe at ∼650 K) [10].

It is now becoming known that the carrier doping alone may not be
sufficient to induce superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds and their
local structure optimization is required. This has been revealed by
studies showing the highly susceptible and unstable nature of the BiS2
lattice [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. For instance, in-plane chemical
pressure, which affects the local structure, is shown to be highly
effective in controlling the superconducting properties of BiS2-based
compounds [17]. Indeed, in-plane chemical pressure can be tuned by an
isovalent substitution, either in the REO (RE = rare earth) block layer
in REO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, BiS2-12 or by a direct substitution in the BiS2
layer (e.g., Se substitution for S in REO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, [22, 23, 24,
25]). Indeed, the peculiar geometry of the BiS2 layer with
non-centrosymmetric distortion [11, 14, 15] is expected to control the
physical properties of these materials.

Recently, a new BiS2-based system, namely, Eu0.5La0.5 FBiS2-xSex, has
been synthesized by codoping, which manifests bulk superconductivity by
Se substitution [26]. The crystal structure is composed of BiS2-xSex
conducting layers and Eu0.5La0.5F block layers [see Fig. 1(b)]. The
nominal carrier doping is 0.5 electron per Bi site, assuming that La³⁺
is substituting Eu²⁺, with Ch (Ch = S, Se) being in the Ch²⁻ state.
Figure 1(a) displays the superconductivity phase diagram of
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. For small Se substitution (x = 0.0 and 0.2),
filamentary superconductivity with a lower transition temperature T_(c)
is observed, while the bulk superconductivity appears for x ≥ 0.6[26].
Concomitantly, metallic conductivity appears for x ≥ 0.6. Indeed, ρ₀
[shown in Fig. 1(a)], estimated from a linear fit of
temperature-dependent resistivity ρ(T)[26] in the interval of 250-300 K
using the equation ρ(T) = ρ₀ + AT (where A is a constant), shows a large
drop for x ≤ 0.6 in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. These observations suggest
that the electronic structure of the system is significantly affected by
Se substitution.

In this work, we study the effect of Se substitution on the valence
electronic states in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. In particular, we investigate
the Eu valence in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex using x-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) to address its possible role in the physical properties of the
title system. XANES spectroscopy is a direct probe of the local
structure and distribution of the valence electrons, with the final
states in the continuum being due to multiple-scattering resonances
[28]. We perform Eu L₃-edge XANES measurements that reveal a mixed
valence of Eu (Eu²⁺ and Eu³⁺) and its evolution with Se substitution. Eu
3d XPS also shows a similar trend of Eu valence as a function of Se
content. Bi 4f XPS indicates that the effective electron carriers in the
BiCh2 layers are slightly increased (or unaffected) by Se substitution.
On the basis of these results we discuss that the enhanced metallicity
and superconductivity are not strictly related to Eu valence and should
be associated with the enhanced carrier mobility caused by optimized
in-plane orbital overlaps due to reduced disorder in the BiCh₂ layer.

## II Experimental details

The conventional solid-state reaction method was used to prepare
polycrystalline samples of Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS_(2 − x)Se_(x) (x = 0.0,
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) [26]. The samples were characterized for
their average structure using powder diffraction at the Xpress beamline
of the Elettra synchrotron radiation facility, ensuring their phase
purity. The samples with nominal x = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 are single
phase, while the samples with x = 0.8 and 1.0 contain a minor (13

X-ray absorption measurements at the Eu L₃ edge were performed using the
BM08 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in
Grenoble where the synchrotron radiation emitted by a bending magnet
source was monochromatized with a double-crystal Si(311) monochromator.
The measurements were made at room temperature in the transmission mode.
The finely powdered samples of Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS_(2 − x)Se_(x) were
mixed uniformly in a boron nitride matrix and pressed into
13-mm-diameter pellets to obtain the edge jump, which was about 1. A
similar procedure was used to prepare the EuFBiS₂ sample.

XPS measurements were performed on two single-phase samples (x = 0.0 and
0.6) at room temperature using the in-house UHV system at the Sapienza
University of Rome, equipped with a double-anode XR50 x-ray source and
an AR125 Omicron electron analyzer. The base pressure during the
measurements was ∼6 x 10⁻⁹ mbar. The Al Kα emission line (hv = 1486.6
eV) was used to measure the Eu 3d XPS, while other core-level XPS
measurements were acquired using the Mg Kα emission line (hv = 1253.6
eV). Both the x-ray incident and photoelectron emission angles were
∼45^(∘) for the measurements. The sample surfaces were repeatedly
scraped _in situ_ by a diamond file to obtain clean surfaces.

## III Results and discussions

Figure 2 shows normalized Eu L₃-edge XANES spectra measured at room
temperature on a series of Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS_(2 − x)Se_(x) samples.
The spectra are normalized with respect to the atomic absorption
estimated by a linear fit to the high-energy part of the spectra. The L₃
absorption process is a 2p_(3/2) → 5ϵd (or 2p_(3/2) → 6ϵs) transition
governed by the dipole selection rules (l = ±1), and hence, empty states
with d or s symmetries (and admixed 4f states) are reached in the final
state. Since the probability of the 2p_(3/2) → 6ϵs transition is
relatively negligible compared with that of the 2p_(3/2) → 5ϵd
transition, the former can be ignored for describing the

Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS_(2 − x)Se_(x). The right axis shows ρ₀ estimated
from a linear fit to the temperature-dependent resistivity [26] in the
interval of 250–300 K using the equation ρ(T) = ρ₀ + AT, with A being a

using the vesta program [27].

Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS_(2 − x)Se_(x). The spectra are shown deconvoluted
(solid curves) in two Gaussian components corresponding to 4f⁷ (Eu²⁺)
and 4f⁶ (Eu³⁺) after background (dash-dotted curve) removal. The inset
shows a close-up of the Eu L₃-edge XANES white line peaks. (top) Eu
L₃-edge XANES white line peaks of EuFBiS₂ (dashed line) are compared
with those of Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂ (solid line).

L₃-edge XANES. In the present case, the Eu L₃-edge XANES spectra of
Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS_(2 − x)Se_(x) exhibit split white line in two peaks
(peak A₁ at ∼6975 eV and peak A₂ at ∼6983 eV), corresponding to the
transitions in the 4 f⁷ and 4 f⁶ final states, indicating the
coexistence of Eu²⁺ and Eu³⁺ valences [29,30]. For x = 0.0, both Eu²⁺
and Eu³⁺ peaks are clearly observed, indicating the mixed-valence state
of Eu, as shown earlier for EuFBiS₂[31]. The Eu L₃-edge XANES spectrum
measured on EuFBiS₂ is shown along with that of Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS₂
for ready reference (top panel), comparing the two white line peaks, A₁
and A₂.

It is possible to estimate the average Eu valence by deconvolution of
the Eu L₃-edge spectrum into Lorentzian components after substraction of
the background estimated by an arctangent function for each spectral
component (shown in Fig. 2). The average Eu valence, calculated from the
ratio of the integrated intensity of the A₁ and A₂ peaks, is  ∼ + 2.31
for x = 0.0. This is close to the Eu valence found earlier (in the range
of +2.14 to 2.28) for EuFBiS₂ polycrystalline samples [31]. The Eu
valence, estimated for EuFBiS₂ in the present work, is found to be
 ∼ +2.33. This suggests that La³⁺ substitution, which is likely to
generate electrons in the conducting BiS₂ layers, hardly affects the Eu
valence. This already indicates that the Eu valence may not have a
simple correlation with charge doping in the BiS₂ layer affecting the
transport behavior of the title system.

On the other hand, the average valence seems to be largely affected by
the Se substitution in the BiS₂ layer. This is evident from peak A₂
corresponding to 4 f⁶ (Eu³⁺), showing a suppressed intensity by Se
substitution (see the inset of Fig. 2). In particular, for a sample with
x = 0.4 and 0.6, the 4 f⁶ peak is relatively weak. The evolution of the
average Eu valence with Se substitution, estimated from the XANES
spectra, is shown in Fig. 3(a). With increasing Se content, the average
Eu valence decreases from  ∼ +2.31 (for x = 0.0) to  ∼ + 2.12 (for
x = 0.4), followed by a slight increase of up to  ∼ +2.18 for x = 0.8
and 1.0 samples.

It is worth noting that, in addition to the observed change in the A₁
and A₂ peaks (related to the change in the Eu valence) the weak feature
B at ∼6990 eV in the Eu L₃-edge XANES also reveals a systematic
evolution. This feature is commonly observed in rare-earth L₃-edge XANES
at ∼20 eV above the main white line transition and is known to be highly
sensitive to the intralayer and interlayer local geometry in layered
systems [32,33]. The feature is also a marker sensitive to the
electronic configuration of rare-earth atoms, and on the basis of
multiple-scattering and density of states calculations it has been found
that the feature B gains intensity with an increase in the 4 f electron
counts [33]. Here, the average number of 4 f electrons increases with Se
content (the ratio of 4 f⁷ to 4 f⁶ increases), which is consistent with
the interpretation of the weak feature being due to a change in the
electronic configuration of the rare-earth metal.

Coming back to the Eu valence, the mixed-valence state of Eu is also
observed by core-level XPS measurements on the same samples. Figure 3(b)
shows Eu 3d XPS for x = 0.0 and 0.6 samples. For both samples, two peaks
corresponding to Eu²⁺ and Eu³⁺ states [34] can be seen. The average Eu
valence is estimated from the ratio of the integrated intensity of these
peaks after subtracting the Shirley-type backgrounds and is found to be
 ∼ +2.4 and  ∼ +2.2 for x = 0.0 and 0.6, respectively. The estimated Eu
valence from the XPS is also included in Fig. 3(a) together with the one
estimated by the Eu L₃-edge XANES. Although the absolute values are
slightly different, the tendency of the change in Eu valence by Se
substitution is similar. The differences are likely to be due to
different surface sensitivities of the XANES and XPS techniques.
Therefore, we can conclude that the Eu valence in
Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS_(2 − x)Se_(x) decreases with increasing Se
substitution, and hence, a smaller charge is available for a possible
doping of the BiS₂ layer.

Further information on the impact of decreasing Eu valence on the BiS₂
layer with Se substitution in Eu_(0.5)La_(0.5)FBiS_(2 − x)Se_(x) can be
obtained by Bi 4 f XPS. Figure 4 shows Bi 4 f core-level photoemission
spectra of x = 0.0 and 0.6 samples, normalized to their integrated
intensities. The spectra include S 2 p and Se 3 p signals, which are
relatively weak because of the smaller photoemission cross section than
that for Bi 4

function of Se substitution (solid circle corresponds to the valence of
Eu for EuFBiS₂). (b) Eu 3d core-level XPS spectra of

at the excitation energy used in this work [35]. In addition, the
broadening due to the super-Coster-Kronig decay makes it difficult to
distinguish the Se 3p signals in the x = 0.6 spectrum. In contrast to
the large change observed in Eu 3d spectra (Fig. 3), the Bi 4f XPS
spectra for the two samples reveal relatively small differences; that
is, the chemical state of Bi remains almost similar in the two samples.
The same can be said for La and F, which is apparent from the
similarities of the La 3d and F 1s XPS spectra of the two samples
displayed in Fig. 5, even though the La 3d and F 1s XPS spectra are
relatively noisy due to the weak-photoemission cross section at the
excitation energy used.

Since the superconductivity in BiS2-based systems is known to be driven
by charge carriers in the BiCh2 layer, we have performed a detailed
analysis of Bi 4f XPS measured on the two samples. A direct spectral
difference between the two samples (x = 0.6 and x = 0.0) is shown in the
bottom panel of Fig. 4. Broad weak structures (colored blue) in the
higher-binding-energy region are due to Se 3p, and sharper structures
(colored pink) are due to Bi 4f. The energy positions of the latter are
slightly different from the Bi 4f peak position, suggesting the
existence of multiple components in the Bi 4f spectra. Indeed, as shown
in the top panel of Fig. 4, the XPS spectra are well reproduced by
profile fitting using two Voigt functions, with a small component in the
higher-binding-energy region likely to be due to the surface component
or due to asymmetry of the main peaks. For the profile fits, the
Gaussian widths are fixed to 0.97 eV, which corresponds to the total
energy resolution of the Bi 4f XPS system used. The Lorentzian widths
for the lower-binding-energy component (colored pink) are 0.26 eV, and
those for the other components, including S 2p, are 0.3 eV. The
Shirley-type background was used. The spin-orbit splitting for Bi 4f and
S 2p (5.3 and 1.2, respectively) and the branching ratios were set to
their statistical values. The energy separation between the two Bi 4f
main components is 0.65 eV, which is almost equal to that (∼1 eV)
reported for LaO_(0.54)F_(0.46)BiS₂[36,37]. The relative binding
energies for all components are fixed to the same values as those for
x = 0.0, except for the Se 3p, which does not exist in the x = 0.0
spectrum. The binding energy of the Se 3p is fixed to the one observed
in the difference spectrum. The Gaussian and Lorentzian widths for Se 3p
are 0.3 and 1.5 eV, respectively, the spin-orbit splitting is 5.8 eV,
and the branching ratio is set to its statistical value. The black
curves are the fit results.

The integrated relative intensity of the lower-binding-energy component
(pink structure) for the Bi 4f peak increases by about 2

components (S 3p and Se 4_p_) after background subtraction (see text).

layer. This is inconsistent with the XPS results, which indicate a small
increase in effective charge carriers. Therefore, other factors are
expected to be active beyond the change in the effective charge in the
Eu0.5La0.5F layer.

Let us discuss the possible impact of the present results on the origin
of the metallic character and superconductivity at low temperature in
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2_(2 − x)Se_(x). First, EuFBiS2 itself is expected to have
excess electrons in the Eu layer due to the Eu mixed valence. In
addition, enough electrons are doped in the Eu0.5La0.5F layer by La³⁺
substitution (50

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we have investigated valence electronic states of the
layered Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2_(2 − x)Se_(x) system using XANES and XPS
spectroscopy. The results reveal that Eu in this system is in the
mixed-valence state with coexisting Eu²⁺ and Eu³⁺. The average valence
shows a significant decrease with increasing Se substitution, revealed
by both Eu L₃-edge XANES and Eu 3d XPS. This decrease in the Eu valence
is expected to lead to a decrease in the electron carriers, unlike the
Bi 4f XPS results revealing a small increase in the carrier density.
From the combined analyses, we have discussed that Se substitution
affects mainly the carrier mobility due to reduced local distortions.
The reduced disorder in the BiCh2 layer is expected to favor in-plane
orbital overlaps, leading to increased carrier mobility and hence
increased metallicity and superconductivity in
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2_(2 − x)Se_(x).
