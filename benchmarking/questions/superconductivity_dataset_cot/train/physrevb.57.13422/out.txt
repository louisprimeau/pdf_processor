###### Abstract

We report the temperature (_T_) and oxygen concentration dependences of the penetration depth of grain-aligned YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ with d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43. The values of the in-plane _l_ab(0) and out-of-plane _l_c(0) penetration depths, the low-temperature linear term in _l_ab(_T_), and the ratio [\lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(0)\,] were found to increase with increasing d. The systematic changes of the linear term in _l_ab(_T_) with _T_c found here and in recent work on HgBa2Ca2Cu3O7-_d_ (_n_ = 1 and 3) are discussed. [S0163-1829(98)04121-6]

In a recent study[1] of the _c_-axis coupling of _d_-wave high-_T_c cuprates we reported the values and temperature (_T_) dependences of the in-plane (_l_ab) and out-of-plane (_l_c) penetration depths for slightly overdoped[2,3] HgBa2CuO4+_d_ (Hg-1201) with critical temperature _T_c = 93 K and slightly underdoped[4,5] HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+_d_ (Hg-1223) with _T_c = 135 K. For both compounds the low-temperature dependence of _l_ab was found to be linear as expected for _d_-wave superconductivity. In fact normalized plots of [\Lambda_{ab}(0)/\Lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} versus _T_/_T_c were the same, and like YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7) (Ref. [6]) agreed very well with mean-field (MF) theory for a weak-coupling _d_-wave superconductor. However, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy[7] (ARPES) and tunneling[8] data strongly suggest that for underdoped samples the superconducting gap D0 remains constant, or even increases slightly, while _T_c falls and so large deviations from MF theory might be expected. We have therefore extended our investigation to deoxygenated (underdoped) pure YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ using the same ac susceptibility technique to measure the penetration depth.[1,6,9,10]

We report experimental results for the values and temperature dependences of _l_ab and _l_c of high-quality _c_-axis grain-aligned orthorhombic[1] YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (which has two CuO2 planes per unit cell as well as Cu-O chains) with d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43, and compare them with tetragonal[12] Hg-1201 with one CuO2 plane per unit cell and tetragonal[13] Hg-1223 with three CuO2 planes per unit cell. We find that the presence of the linear term in _l_ab(_T_) is independent of the number of CuO2 planes per unit cell, carrier concentration, crystal structure, anisotropy and the presence of chains. Surprisingly our data show good agreement with weak-coupling _d_-wave theory, and the linear term in [\Lambda_{ab}(T)/\Lambda_{ab}(0)\,] appears to scale with _T_/_T_c. This result highlights the need for detailed consideration of the relationship between superconducting and normal-state energy gaps in underdoped cuprates.

Sample preparation was carried out by the standard solid-state reaction process using high-purity (99.999%) Y2O3, BaCO3, and CuO oxides. Electron probe microanalysis and x-ray diffraction showed that all samples were single phase within an accuracy of ~1 %. The fully oxygenated, d = 0.0 (YBCO7, _T_c = 92 K), samples were prepared by annealing bulk pieces in pure oxygen atmosphere at 380 degC for 24 h and then slowly cooling to room temperature. (Hereafter _T_c represents the temperature where the onset of superconductivity occurs in the ac susceptibility data for a measuring field _H_ac = 3 G rms and frequency f = 333 Hz.) The d = 0.3 (YBCO6, _T_c = 66 K) sample was prepared by annealing in pure oxygen atmosphere at 650 degC for 12 h and then quenching in liquid nitrogen, while the d = 0.43 (YBCO6,57, _T_c = 56 K) sample was annealed in 0.2% O2/N2 atmosphere at 550 degC for 12 h and also quenched into liquid nitrogen. The final oxygen contents were determined from the weight change of a fully oxygenated reference sample. The d = 0.0 bulk piece was lightly ground and sedimented in acetone to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution. The sedimented powders were then heat treated to repair any structural damages to the surface of the grains.[14] For d = 0.3 and 0.43, on the other hand, a bulk piece for each d was lightly ground and sieved through a 20 _m_m sieve in an argon glove box to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution[10] and to avoid surface degradation of the crystallites.[14] The collected powders were then kept in argon atmosphere for 30 min before being aligned. All powders, d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43, were magnetically aligned in epoxy as described earlier.[16,10] The average grain diameters corresponding to the 50% cumulative volume point were 5 and 10 _m_m for the fully oxygenated and the oxygen deficient samples, respectively. The fraction of the unoriented powder in all grain-aligned samples was estimated to be <5 %. Rocking curve analysis of the d = 0.0 and d > 0.0 samples gave a full width at half maximum of +- 1.4deg and +- 1 deg, respectively.[15] Low-field susceptibility _kh_ measurements were performed using commercial equipment (down to 4.2 K) for samples with d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43. The sample with d = 0.43 was also measured down to 1.2 K using a home built susceptometer. Details of the experimental technique and the application of London's model for deriving _kh_ from the measured _kh_ in cuprate superconductors can be found in earlier publications.[1,6,9,10,16]

The values of _l_ab(0) derived from our data are 0.14, 0.21, and 0.28 _m_m and the corresponding values for _l_c(0) are 1.26, 4.53, and 7.17 _m_m for d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43, respectively. The errors in _l_ab(0) arising from a possible uncertainty of +- 5% in the alignment can be as high as +- 25%, whereas those in _l_c(0) are +- 8%. However, the corresponding uncertainty in the linear term in [\Lambda_{ab}(T)/\Lambda_{ab}(0)\,] is much less, at most +-10%. The present results differ from previous work [17] in which the surfaces of the particles were probably not as clean and the degree of grain alignment was probably lower. As T_{c} is reduced by lowering the carrier concentration (for \delta = 0.3 and 0.43), [1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] falls, a behavior which has been extensively discussed in terms of the Uemura relation. [18, 19] The ratio \gamma=[\lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(0)], i.e., the anisotropy, increases with oxygen deficiency.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b), show characteristic low-temperature plots of [\lambda(T)/\lambda(0)] for the ab plane (measured with the applied field H\parallelc) and c axis (measured with H\parallelab), respectively, for the three oxygen concentrations studied. The low-temperature (T/T_{c}<0.25) linear term in \lambda_{ab}(T), is 4.8 A/K for YBCO_{9} in good agreement with that found from microwave measurements on YBCO_{6.95} single crystals. [20] As oxygen is removed from the lattice (the chains) the linear term increases to 12 and 20 A/K for \delta= 0.3 and 0.43, respectively. For YBCO_{7} we also observe a linear T dependence in \lambda_{c} at low temperatures but the relative change is about a factor of 2 smaller than in [\lambda_{ab}(T)/\lambda_{ab}(0)], while \lambda_{c}(T) of YBCO_{6.7} and YBCO_{6.57} obeys a T^{2} behavior at low T. Details of the systematics of \lambda_{c}(T) of cuprate superconductors can be found in Refs. [1, 6, 21, 22].

In Fig. 2 we present normalized plots of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} and [\lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{c}(T)]^{2} versus T/T_{c}. There is excellent agreement between the [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} curves for the three oxygen concentrations. The data in Fig. 2(a) are compared with the weak-coupling theory for a d-wave superconductor (solid line). [23] It can be seen that the d-wave curve fits the data very well. On the other hand, the [\lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{c}(T)]^{2} curves do not fit the d-wave curve and also differ from each other slightly, because of the effect of the intermediate coupling on \lambda_{c}(T). [1, 6, 10, 21, 22] We also find that [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} agrees with that of Hg-1201 and Hg-1223. [1, 10] The behavior of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} is generally similar to that of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7} (x = 0.02 and 0.03), [6] except at very low temperatures where a T^{2} term developed in the Zn-doped samples due to impurity scattering.

The full temperature dependences of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (\delta = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43), YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7} (x = 0.02 and 0.03), Hg-1201 and Hg-1223 are also in agreement with recent data of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} (Bi-2212) (Ref. [24]) and Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} (Tl-2201) (Ref. [25]) single crystals measured by a microwave technique with H\parallelc, but they only agree with another set of microwave data (H\parallelc) for Bi-2212 single crystals [26] at T/T_{c}<0.3. At higher temperatures the data in Ref. [26] deviate from the weak-coupling d-wave calculation. Independent evidence for the scaling behavior of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} with T/T_{c} can also be found in a recent publication by Bonn _et al._[27] who measured the relative changes in \lambda with temperature for underdoped, optimally doped and slightly overdoped untwinned YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} crystals using a microwave technique and H\perpc. However, in Ref. [27] the changes of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} for YBCO_{6.95}, at high temperatures, and YBCO_{6.6}, over the whole temperature range, were smaller than ours and closer, at high temperatures, to the Bi-2212 data in Ref. [26]. We do not know the precise origin of this difference but we believe that for weakly coupled layers, data taken with H\parallelc give the best measure of the superfluid density.

Figure 3 shows plots of \{1-[\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} vs T which is equivalent to \{[n_{s}(0)-n_{s}(T)]/n_{s}(0)\}, i.e., the normalized density of quasiparticle excitations, where n_{s}(T) is the density of condensed electrons at a temperature T, for all the samples studied. It is clear that the linear term in \{

 -\bigl{[}\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)\bigr{]}^{2}\bigr{]} increases as T_{c} decreases. If we use the standard BCS result for \lambda\,(T) of a d-wave superconductor,[28]

\[\bigl{[}\lambda(0)/\lambda(T)\bigr{]}^{2}\!\approx\!1-2\,(T/\Delta_{0})\ln 2,\] (1)

to fit the experimental data shown in Fig. 3 (at T/T_{c}\!<\!0.25), we find that \Delta_{0} scales approximately with T_{c} [Fig. 3 (inset)], giving \Delta_{0}\!\approx\!2\,T_{c} , a value close to that expected for weak-coupling superconductivity.[28] For comparison we also include data for the s-wave perovskite Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}BiO_{3} (BKBO).[10] The compounds Bi-2212 (Refs. [24] and [26]) and Tl-2201 (Ref. [25]) would also give \Delta_{0}\!\approx\!2\,T_{c} on this plot. The maximum error in the linear terms, i.e., the values of \Delta_{0} in Fig. 3 (inset), is \pm 20%.

The scaling of \Delta_{0} with T_{c} , Fig. 3 (inset), is in agreement with early tunneling spectroscopy data[29] for several cuprates as a function of carrier concentration, ranging from the underdoped to the optimally doped regimes. It is not consistent however, with more recent tunneling[8] and ARPES (Ref. [7]) results for underdoped cuprates where \Delta_{0} was actually found to increase slightly while T_{c} falls. There seems to be two possible ways of accounting this discrepancy. One is that the recent spectroscopic experiments[7, 8] actually measure the normal-state gap. In this scenario the effect of the normal-state gap would be to leave small pockets of holes whose superconducting properties are still described reasonably well by MF theory. The other is similar to a recent phenomenological approach.[30] As shown in Fig. 4, it is probable, that within experimental error, the _unnormalized_ plots of [1/\lambda_{ab}(T)^{2}], i.e., n_{s}(T), versus T at low temperatures are parallel for samples with different T_{c} values. This would correspond to the same number of excited quasiparticles, [\,n_{s}(0)-n_{s}(T)\,], at a given temperature for all T_{c} values--as implied by specific-heat work on underdoped YBCO.[31] Such parallel shifts give [\,n_{s}(0)-n_{s}(T)\,]\!=\!\alpha T, where \alpha is independent of doping level (T_{c}). In combination with the well-known Uemura relation n_{s}(0)\!\propto\!T_{c},[18] this gives [1 -\,n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0)\,]\!=\!\beta T/T_{c} , where \beta is independent of T_{c} . So at low T\,[\,\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)\,]^{2} versus T/T_{c} would still scale on to a single curve even when the MF relation \Delta_{0}/T_{c}\!\approx\!2, is strongly violated.

In conclusion, we have studied \lambda_{ab}(T) and \lambda_{c}(T) of high-quality grain-aligned YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with \delta\!=\!0.0, 0.3, and 0.43. The values of \lambda_{ab}(0), \lambda_{c}(0), and \gamma were found to increase with oxygen deficiency. We find that the existence of the linear term in \lambda_{ab}(T) is independent of the number of CuO_{2} planes per unit cell, carrier concentration, crystal structure, anisotropy, and the presence of chains. If viewed in isolation, all the penetration depth data presented here and most of the microwave measurements for H|l_{c} appear to be in excellent agreement with mean-field theory for a weak-coupling d-wave superconductor for which \Delta_{0}/T_{c}\!\approx\!2. However, recent spectroscopic data are more consistent with a different approach[30] in which there is a strong interplay between the superconducting and normal-state gaps. Clearly the relationship between these two gaps is of crucial importance for understanding superconductivity in the cuprates.

###### Abstract

We report the temperature (_T_) and oxygen concentration dependences of the penetration depth of grain-aligned YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ with d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43. The values of the in-plane _l_ab(0) and out-of-plane _l_c(0) penetration depths, the low-temperature linear term in _l_ab(_T_), and the ratio [\lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(0)\,] were found to increase with increasing d. The systematic changes of the linear term in _l_ab(_T_) with _T_c found here and in recent work on HgBa2Ca2Cu3O7-_d_ (_n_ = 1 and 3) are discussed. [S0163-1829(98)04121-6]

In a recent study[1] of the _c_-axis coupling of _d_-wave high-_T_c cuprates we reported the values and temperature (_T_) dependences of the in-plane (_l_ab) and out-of-plane (_l_c) penetration depths for slightly overdoped[2,3] HgBa2CuO4+_d_ (Hg-1201) with critical temperature _T_c = 93 K and slightly underdoped[4,5] HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+_d_ (Hg-1223) with _T_c = 135 K. For both compounds the low-temperature dependence of _l_ab was found to be linear as expected for _d_-wave superconductivity. In fact normalized plots of [\Lambda_{ab}(0)/\Lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} versus _T_/_T_c were the same, and like YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO7) (Ref. [6]) agreed very well with mean-field (MF) theory for a weak-coupling _d_-wave superconductor. However, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy[7] (ARPES) and tunneling[8] data strongly suggest that for underdoped samples the superconducting gap D0 remains constant, or even increases slightly, while _T_c falls and so large deviations from MF theory might be expected. We have therefore extended our investigation to deoxygenated (underdoped) pure YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ using the same ac susceptibility technique to measure the penetration depth.[1,6,9,10]

We report experimental results for the values and temperature dependences of _l_ab and _l_c of high-quality _c_-axis grain-aligned orthorhombic[1] YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (which has two CuO2 planes per unit cell as well as Cu-O chains) with d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43, and compare them with tetragonal[12] Hg-1201 with one CuO2 plane per unit cell and tetragonal[13] Hg-1223 with three CuO2 planes per unit cell. We find that the presence of the linear term in _l_ab(_T_) is independent of the number of CuO2 planes per unit cell, carrier concentration, crystal structure, anisotropy and the presence of chains. Surprisingly our data show good agreement with weak-coupling _d_-wave theory, and the linear term in [\Lambda_{ab}(T)/\Lambda_{ab}(0)\,] appears to scale with _T_/_T_c. This result highlights the need for detailed consideration of the relationship between superconducting and normal-state energy gaps in underdoped cuprates.

Sample preparation was carried out by the standard solid-state reaction process using high-purity (99.999%) Y2O3, BaCO3, and CuO oxides. Electron probe microanalysis and x-ray diffraction showed that all samples were single phase within an accuracy of ~1 %. The fully oxygenated, d = 0.0 (YBCO7, _T_c = 92 K), samples were prepared by annealing bulk pieces in pure oxygen atmosphere at 380 degC for 24 h and then slowly cooling to room temperature. (Hereafter _T_c represents the temperature where the onset of superconductivity occurs in the ac susceptibility data for a measuring field _H_ac = 3 G rms and frequency f = 333 Hz.) The d = 0.3 (YBCO6, _T_c = 66 K) sample was prepared by annealing in pure oxygen atmosphere at 650 degC for 12 h and then quenching in liquid nitrogen, while the d = 0.43 (YBCO6,57, _T_c = 56 K) sample was annealed in 0.2% O2/N2 atmosphere at 550 degC for 12 h and also quenched into liquid nitrogen. The final oxygen contents were determined from the weight change of a fully oxygenated reference sample. The d = 0.0 bulk piece was lightly ground and sedimented in acetone to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution. The sedimented powders were then heat treated to repair any structural damages to the surface of the grains.[14] For d = 0.3 and 0.43, on the other hand, a bulk piece for each d was lightly ground and sieved through a 20 _m_m sieve in an argon glove box to obtain a well-defined grain size distribution[10] and to avoid surface degradation of the crystallites.[14] The collected powders were then kept in argon atmosphere for 30 min before being aligned. All powders, d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43, were magnetically aligned in epoxy as described earlier.[16,10] The average grain diameters corresponding to the 50% cumulative volume point were 5 and 10 _m_m for the fully oxygenated and the oxygen deficient samples, respectively. The fraction of the unoriented powder in all grain-aligned samples was estimated to be <5 %. Rocking curve analysis of the d = 0.0 and d > 0.0 samples gave a full width at half maximum of +- 1.4deg and +- 1 deg, respectively.[15] Low-field susceptibility _kh_ measurements were performed using commercial equipment (down to 4.2 K) for samples with d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43. The sample with d = 0.43 was also measured down to 1.2 K using a home built susceptometer. Details of the experimental technique and the application of London's model for deriving _kh_ from the measured _kh_ in cuprate superconductors can be found in earlier publications.[1,6,9,10,16]

The values of _l_ab(0) derived from our data are 0.14, 0.21, and 0.28 _m_m and the corresponding values for _l_c(0) are 1.26, 4.53, and 7.17 _m_m for d = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43, respectively. The errors in _l_ab(0) arising from a possible uncertainty of +- 5% in the alignment can be as high as +- 25%, whereas those in _l_c(0) are +- 8%. However, the corresponding uncertainty in the linear term in [\Lambda_{ab}(T)/\Lambda_{ab}(0)\,] is much less, at most +-10%. The present results differ from previous work [17] in which the surfaces of the particles were probably not as clean and the degree of grain alignment was probably lower. As T_{c} is reduced by lowering the carrier concentration (for \delta = 0.3 and 0.43), [1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)] falls, a behavior which has been extensively discussed in terms of the Uemura relation. [18, 19] The ratio \gamma=[\lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(0)], i.e., the anisotropy, increases with oxygen deficiency.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b), show characteristic low-temperature plots of [\lambda(T)/\lambda(0)] for the ab plane (measured with the applied field H\parallelc) and c axis (measured with H\parallelab), respectively, for the three oxygen concentrations studied. The low-temperature (T/T_{c}<0.25) linear term in \lambda_{ab}(T), is 4.8 A/K for YBCO_{9} in good agreement with that found from microwave measurements on YBCO_{6.95} single crystals. [20] As oxygen is removed from the lattice (the chains) the linear term increases to 12 and 20 A/K for \delta= 0.3 and 0.43, respectively. For YBCO_{7} we also observe a linear T dependence in \lambda_{c} at low temperatures but the relative change is about a factor of 2 smaller than in [\lambda_{ab}(T)/\lambda_{ab}(0)], while \lambda_{c}(T) of YBCO_{6.7} and YBCO_{6.57} obeys a T^{2} behavior at low T. Details of the systematics of \lambda_{c}(T) of cuprate superconductors can be found in Refs. [1, 6, 21, 22].

In Fig. 2 we present normalized plots of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} and [\lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{c}(T)]^{2} versus T/T_{c}. There is excellent agreement between the [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} curves for the three oxygen concentrations. The data in Fig. 2(a) are compared with the weak-coupling theory for a d-wave superconductor (solid line). [23] It can be seen that the d-wave curve fits the data very well. On the other hand, the [\lambda_{c}(0)/\lambda_{c}(T)]^{2} curves do not fit the d-wave curve and also differ from each other slightly, because of the effect of the intermediate coupling on \lambda_{c}(T). [1, 6, 10, 21, 22] We also find that [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} agrees with that of Hg-1201 and Hg-1223. [1, 10] The behavior of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} is generally similar to that of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7} (x = 0.02 and 0.03), [6] except at very low temperatures where a T^{2} term developed in the Zn-doped samples due to impurity scattering.

The full temperature dependences of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (\delta = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.43), YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7} (x = 0.02 and 0.03), Hg-1201 and Hg-1223 are also in agreement with recent data of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} (Bi-2212) (Ref. [24]) and Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6+\delta} (Tl-2201) (Ref. [25]) single crystals measured by a microwave technique with H\parallelc, but they only agree with another set of microwave data (H\parallelc) for Bi-2212 single crystals [26] at T/T_{c}<0.3. At higher temperatures the data in Ref. [26] deviate from the weak-coupling d-wave calculation. Independent evidence for the scaling behavior of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} with T/T_{c} can also be found in a recent publication by Bonn _et al._[27] who measured the relative changes in \lambda with temperature for underdoped, optimally doped and slightly overdoped untwinned YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} crystals using a microwave technique and H\perpc. However, in Ref. [27] the changes of [\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} for YBCO_{6.95}, at high temperatures, and YBCO_{6.6}, over the whole temperature range, were smaller than ours and closer, at high temperatures, to the Bi-2212 data in Ref. [26]. We do not know the precise origin of this difference but we believe that for weakly coupled layers, data taken with H\parallelc give the best measure of the superfluid density.

Figure 3 shows plots of \{1-[\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)]^{2} vs T which is equivalent to \{[n_{s}(0)-n_{s}(T)]/n_{s}(0)\}, i.e., the normalized density of quasiparticle excitations, where n_{s}(T) is the density of condensed electrons at a temperature T, for all the samples studied. It is clear that the linear term in \{

 -\bigl{[}\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)\bigr{]}^{2}\bigr{]} increases as T_{c} decreases. If we use the standard BCS result for \lambda\,(T) of a d-wave superconductor,[28]

\[\bigl{[}\lambda(0)/\lambda(T)\bigr{]}^{2}\!\approx\!1-2\,(T/\Delta_{0})\ln 2,\] (1)

to fit the experimental data shown in Fig. 3 (at T/T_{c}\!<\!0.25), we find that \Delta_{0} scales approximately with T_{c} [Fig. 3 (inset)], giving \Delta_{0}\!\approx\!2\,T_{c} , a value close to that expected for weak-coupling superconductivity.[28] For comparison we also include data for the s-wave perovskite Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}BiO_{3} (BKBO).[10] The compounds Bi-2212 (Refs. [24] and [26]) and Tl-2201 (Ref. [25]) would also give \Delta_{0}\!\approx\!2\,T_{c} on this plot. The maximum error in the linear terms, i.e., the values of \Delta_{0} in Fig. 3 (inset), is \pm 20%.

The scaling of \Delta_{0} with T_{c} , Fig. 3 (inset), is in agreement with early tunneling spectroscopy data[29] for several cuprates as a function of carrier concentration, ranging from the underdoped to the optimally doped regimes. It is not consistent however, with more recent tunneling[8] and ARPES (Ref. [7]) results for underdoped cuprates where \Delta_{0} was actually found to increase slightly while T_{c} falls. There seems to be two possible ways of accounting this discrepancy. One is that the recent spectroscopic experiments[7, 8] actually measure the normal-state gap. In this scenario the effect of the normal-state gap would be to leave small pockets of holes whose superconducting properties are still described reasonably well by MF theory. The other is similar to a recent phenomenological approach.[30] As shown in Fig. 4, it is probable, that within experimental error, the _unnormalized_ plots of [1/\lambda_{ab}(T)^{2}], i.e., n_{s}(T), versus T at low temperatures are parallel for samples with different T_{c} values. This would correspond to the same number of excited quasiparticles, [\,n_{s}(0)-n_{s}(T)\,], at a given temperature for all T_{c} values--as implied by specific-heat work on underdoped YBCO.[31] Such parallel shifts give [\,n_{s}(0)-n_{s}(T)\,]\!=\!\alpha T, where \alpha is independent of doping level (T_{c}). In combination with the well-known Uemura relation n_{s}(0)\!\propto\!T_{c},[18] this gives [1 -\,n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0)\,]\!=\!\beta T/T_{c} , where \beta is independent of T_{c} . So at low T\,[\,\lambda_{ab}(0)/\lambda_{ab}(T)\,]^{2} versus T/T_{c} would still scale on to a single curve even when the MF relation \Delta_{0}/T_{c}\!\approx\!2, is strongly violated.

In conclusion, we have studied \lambda_{ab}(T) and \lambda_{c}(T) of high-quality grain-aligned YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} with \delta\!=\!0.0, 0.3, and 0.43. The values of \lambda_{ab}(0), \lambda_{c}(0), and \gamma were found to increase with oxygen deficiency. We find that the existence of the linear term in \lambda_{ab}(T) is independent of the number of CuO_{2} planes per unit cell, carrier concentration, crystal structure, anisotropy, and the presence of chains. If viewed in isolation, all the penetration depth data presented here and most of the microwave measurements for H|l_{c} appear to be in excellent agreement with mean-field theory for a weak-coupling d-wave superconductor for which \Delta_{0}/T_{c}\!\approx\!2. However, recent spectroscopic data are more consistent with a different approach[30] in which there is a strong interplay between the superconducting and normal-state gaps. Clearly the relationship between these two gaps is of crucial importance for understanding superconductivity in the cuprates.
