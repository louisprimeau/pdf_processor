###### Abstract

We report the study of superconductivity and magnetism in
Sc_(5 − x)Dy_(x)Ir₄Si₁₀ (x = 0,0.5, 1,1.5,2,3,4,4.5,5) alloys. We find
that the superconducting transition temperature decreases as x increases
and a linear increase of antiferromagnetic ordering temperature from x =
2 to 5. We also report an observation of the coexistence of
superconductivity and magnetism for x = 1.5 from resistivity and ac
susceptibility measurements in small applied dc magnetic fields.

## I Introduction

Most of the studies on the coexistence of superconductivity and
magnetism are made either on RMo₆S₈ chalcogenides or on RRh₄B₄ borides
(R is a rare-earth element).[1] In these systems the superconductivity
arises due to Mo clusters and Rh clusters, respectively, while magnetism
is due to the rare-earth element. In the case of ternary silicides
Sc₅Ir₄Si₁₀ (Ref. [2]) (where there are no clusters responsible for
superconductivity and no direct Ir-Ir contacts), it is of interest to
study the effect of the magnetic rare-earth element substitution for Sc
on the superconductivity of this system. With this motivation we have
studied the effect of Dy substitution for Sc on the normal and
superconducting state properties in the Sc₅Ir₄Si₁₀ system.

Previous studies[3] have shown that the compound Sc₃Ir₄Si₁₀ undergoes a
superconducting transition (T_(C)) below 8.5 K whereas Dy₅Ir₄Si₁₀
becomes antiferromagnetic (T_(N)) below 5 K. We have reported detailed
susceptibility and resistivity studies on Dy₅Ir₄Si₁₀ which exhibits
superzone effects near the antiferromagnetic transition.[4] In this
paper we present our detailed study of normal-state resistivity,
susceptibility, transition temperature (T_(C), T_(N)) for the
Sc_(5 − x)Dy_(x)Ir₄Si₁₀ (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5) system. We
also report the observation of coexistence of superconductivity and
magnetism in the Sc_(5, 5)Dy_(1, 5)Ir₄Si₁₀ alloy by performing
resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements in various dc magnetic
fields.

## II Experimental Details

All samples were made by melting the individual constituents in an arc
furnace under high-purity argon atmosphere. The purity of Sc, Dy, and Ir
is 99.99

calibrated Si diode (zero-field) and carbon glass (in-field) sensors
(Lake Shore, USA). The sample voltage was measured with a Keithley
nanovoltmeter with a current of 20 mA using a 20-ppm-stable HP current
source. All the data were collected via an IEEE488 interface using a
PC/AT machine.

## III Results and Discussion

### Susceptibility studies on antiferromagnetic samples (_x_ >= 2.0)

The transition temperature (both T_(C) and T_(N)) dependence on the
concentration x of Dy is shown in Fig. 2. We find that T_(N) decreases
almost linearly from 5 to 3.5 K as x decreases from 5 to 2. The observed
moment (from the high-temperature susceptibility data) is around
10.6_m__B_ which is the free-ion value for Dy. The temperature
dependence of _kh_ of two samples (Dy5Ir4Si10, Dy4Sc1Ir4Si10) from 2 to
300 K is shown in Fig. 3. The temperature dependence of _kh_ from 2 to
25 K is shown in the inset. One can observe the AF state around 5.0 K
for the parent sample and 4.5 K for the Sc substituted one where
_d_(_khT_)/_dT_ shows a maximum. One can also see that high-temperature
_kh_(100 < T < 300 K) data shows Curie-Weiss law [_kh_(_T_) = _C_/(_T_ -
_Ph__N_)] from Fig. 4. The other samples show similar dependence and the
values of T_(N), _Ph__N_, and m_(f) are given in Table 1. It will be
interesting to study the anisotropy effects in this system using single
crystals.

### Resistivity studies on antiferromagnetic samples (_x_ >= 2.0)

In order to understand the resistivity (_r_) dependence on temperature
we have separated the resistivity data into two regions, namely, the
low-temperature region (_T_ <= _Ph__D_/10) and the high-temperature
region (50 - 300 K)

#### iii.2.1 Low temperature resistivity studies (T_(N) < T <
_Ph__D_/10)

The low-temperature resistivity of the various alloys are shown in Fig.
5. Here we find in the Dy5Ir4Si10 sample, a broad minimum in r around 17
K and a maximum around 6 K. Such a minimum has been seen in many
antiferromagnetic rare-earth metals6-8 which arises due to magnetic
superzone effects. In the case of rare-earth metals like Dy the
resistivity shows a minimum followed by a maximum along the c axis
before it decreases due to antiferromagnetic ordering.8 This has been
attributed to the magnetic superzone effect which arises because of the
fact that the antiferromagnetic phase has a periodic arrangement along
the c axis which is incommensurate with that of the lattice. However,
such effects are not reported in

intermetallic compounds. Only one paper [9] has observed this effect in
substituted samples and not in an antiferromagnetic compound like
Dy5Ir5Si10.

One can understand the minimum and the maximum in r near the
antiferromagnetic transition as follows. If one assumes an oscillatory
arrangement of 4f spins, the conduction electrons will experience a
periodic potential through the _s-f_ interaction whose period is
incommensurate with that of the crystal lattice. This periodic
potential, together with that of the lattice, produces gaps in the
energy dispersion of conduction electrons. When the gap appears in the
conduction band, the effective number of electrons are reduced. So, near
the magnetic transition, this increases the resistivity of the sample.
However, spin disorder scattering (due to thermal fluctuations)
decreases resistivity as one approaches T_(N) from room temperature. The
combination of these two effects results in the unusual dependence of r
on temperature along the c axis in many rare-earth elements (Dy, Tm, Er,
Eu, Ho, and Gd). The r along the a axis shows normal behavior of a
magnetic material.

We also see that the minimum becomes shallower as x increases in
Dy5-_x_Sc_x_Ir_4Si10 and disappears for x = 2 and above. Although our
samples are polycrystalline we can see the superzone effect clearly in
our alloys. However, to compare with theory it is essential to do
transport measurements in single crystals of Dy5Ir5Si10 and its alloys
and also the neutron diffraction study to estimate the reduced moment.

#### iii.2.2 **High-temperature resistivity studies (50 K < T < 300 K)**

The high-temperature _r_(_T_) data for various Dy-rich alloys are shown
in Fig. 6.

All the alloys show an initial increase in r and tendency toward
saturation at high temperature. We believe that this saturation has
nothing to do with either magnetism or superconductivity in this system.
Such a deviation from linear temperature dependence at high temperature
has been seen in many alloys where the saturation is attributed to the
high value of r of these alloys at high temperatures. One of the models
which describe the _r_(_T_) of nonmagnetic materials is known as the
parallel resistor model. In this model the expression for _r_(_T_) is
given by

$$\frac{1}{\rho(T)} = \frac{1}{\rho_{I}(T)} + \frac{1}{\rho_{\rm Max}}\ ,$$

where _r_Max is the saturation resistivity which is independent of
temperature and _r_(_T_) is the ideal temperature-dependent resistivity.
Further, the ideal resistivity is given by the following expression. The
only assumption we have made in addition to the above model is to assume
a linear temperature dependence of spin-disorder scattering at high
temperature:

$$\rho_{I}(T) = \rho_{0} + C_{1}(T/\Theta_{D})^{3}{\int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}/T}}\frac{x^{3}dx}{(1-e^{-x})(e^{x}-1)} + C_{2}T\ ,$$

where r0 is the residual resistivity the second term is due

k_(F) is the Fermi wave vector, l is the mean-free path), is no longer
valid in these compounds. They suggest that the parallel resistor model
[Eq. (2) without the linear term] is appropriate for these systems. We
fitted the resistivity data for Sc-rich alloys using this model and the
fitted values are shown by the continuous lines in Fig. 10. The values
of the various parameters used in this model are given in Table 4. The
value of the Θ_(D) obtained from this analysis agrees very well with the
heat capacity results [12] for the Sc3Ir4Si10 sample. This gives the
necessary credibility to this model. One also finds that both ρ₀, C₁,
and $\rho_{\rm max}$ increase with Dy substitution. On the other hand,
Θ_(D) decreases with increasing Dy in these alloys.

### Coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in Sc3,Dy1.3Ir4Si10

#### 5.5.1 **Resistivity and susceptibility studies**

The temperature dependence of the susceptibility (χ) of this sample is
shown in Fig. 11.

The inset shows the temperature dependence of χ from 60 to 300 $\rm K$.
The high temperature χ shows a Curie-Weiss behavior (similar to Dy-rich
alloys) and an effective moment of 10.6μ_(B). From the figure one can
see that the sample undergoes superconducting transition before it
becomes antiferromagnetic. The ac susceptibility in various dc magnetic
fields clearly shows the antiferromagnetism as superconductivity is
destroyed by the applied field. This data for two field values are shown
in Fig. 12. We see that the sample has already become normal at an
applied field of 2 KOe and above. The resistivity data shown in Fig. 13
show similar behavior at these fields. There is a small structure in the
ρ(T) near 4 $\rm K$ for low dc applied fields. The reason for such a
structure is not clear and one has to wait for the single-crystal
measurement to understand this behavior. The normal-state resistivity
can be fitted to Eq. (2) and the data is shown in Fig. 14. The inset
shows the superconducting transition of this sample.

## IV Conclusion

We have studied the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in
Sc_(5 − x)Dy_(x)Ir₄Si₁₀(x=0,0.5,1,1.5,2,3,4, 4.5,5) system by using dc
and ac susceptibility and resistivity measurements. The effective moment
is equal to the free Dy ion for antiferromagnetic samples. The T_(N)
increases linearly with x (from x=2) and T_(C) decreases somewhat
rapidly as x increases to 1.5 and decreases below 1.5 K for x=2 and
above. The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism is established
for x=1.5 using ac susceptibility and resistivity in small applied dc
magnetic fields.
