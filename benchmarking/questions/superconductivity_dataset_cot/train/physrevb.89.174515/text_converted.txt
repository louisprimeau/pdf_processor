###### Abstract

Superconducting properties under high magnetic fields for the BiS₂-based
layered superconductor LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ (polycrystalline sample
prepared using the high-pressure synthesis method) are investigated. The
anisotropy of the upper critical field is discussed by analyzing the
temperature dependence of the temperature derivative of resistivity. The
temperature dependence of the upper critical field shows an anomalous
behavior with a characteristic magnetic field of 8 T. We reveal that the
anomalous behavior is caused by the existence of three kinds of upper
critical field μ₀H_(c2)^(max), μ₀H_(c2)^(max), and μ₀H_(c2)^(min) in
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂. The lowest upper critical field μ₀H_(c2)^(min) is
regarded as μ₀H_(c2), where the superconducting states of the grains
with an orientation of H||c are suppressed. The μ₀H_(c2)^(max) and
μ₀H_(c2)^(max) are regarded as μ₀H_(c2), where the superconducting
states of the grains with an orientation of H||ab are suppressed. The
difference between μ₀H_(c2)^(max) and μ₀H_(c2)^(max) could be explained
by the anisotropy of superconducting states within the Bi-S plane. The
estimated anisotropy parameter of the upper critical fields is about 7.4
for the high-pressure-synthesized LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ polycrystalline
sample. Since this value is clearly lower than the anisotropy parameter
of over 30 observed in previously reported LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ single
crystals grown under ambient pressure, we conclude that a larger
anisotropy of superconductivity is not essential for the enhancement of
T_(c) and lower anisotropy might be important for a higher T_(c) in
LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂.

## I Introduction

Layered superconductors have drawn the attention of much research
because of the appearance of unconventional superconductivity and a high
transition temperature T_(c). So far, two kinds of high-T_(c) layered
superconductors, cuprates and Fe-based superconductors, have been
discovered [1,2]. Both of the high-T_(c) superconductors possess a
crystal structure composed of an alternate stacking of common
superconducting layers and spacer layers. Recently, we discovered
layered superconductors with the BiS₂ superconducting layers [3,4]. This
family possesses a crystal structure composed of an alternate stacking
of the common BiS₂ superconducting layers and the various spacer layers
such as E₂O₂ (E = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, or Yb) [4-11], Sr₂F₂[12,13], and
Bi₄O₄(SO₄)_(1 − x) layers [3]. Their crystal structure at room
temperature and under ambient pressure is categorized into the
tetragonal space group P4/_mmm_. Basically, a parent phase of the BiS₂
family is a semiconductor with a band gap. The BiS₂-based materials
become metallic with electron doping into the BiS₂ layers and then
exhibit superconductivity at low temperatures. In the superconducting
phases, two Bi ξ_p_ orbitals ξ_p__(x) and ξ_p__(y) are essential for the
evolution of superconducting states [14-20].

So far, the highest T_(c) in the BiS₂-based family is
$T_{c}^{\rm onset}\sim$ 11 K of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂. The
superconducting properties of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ are highly sensitive
to application of pressure. Although as-grown LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂
prepared by a solid-state reaction shows a superconducting transition
with T_(c)∼ 3 K [2], the T_(c) can be enhanced to over 10 K by applying
high pressure [21-23]. The higher-T_(c) phase of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂
can be obtained by annealing the as-grown LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ sample
under a high pressure of 2 GPa. Namely, the higher-T_(c) (high-pressure)
structure could be memorized even after the sample is put at ambient
pressure after the high-pressure annealing [2,23]. One-step
high-pressure synthesis can also provide a higher-T_(c) phase of
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ under the optimal synthesis conditions of 2 GPa and
700 degC [24]. Crystal structure analysis reveals that the higher-T_(c)
phase of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ can be induced by uniaxial lattice
contraction along the c axis [25]. Furthermore, Tomita _et al._ reported
that the lattice contraction under high pressure could be explained by a
structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic on the basis of
analysis of the x-ray-diffraction patterns under high pressure and
optimization of the atomic positions by using density functional theory
calculations [23]. In this article, we show a largely anisotropic
magnetic field-temperature _H-T_ phase diagram of superconductivity in
the higher-T_(c) phase of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂.

## II Experimental details

A polycrystalline sample of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ was prepared using
high-pressure synthesis with a cubic-anvil-type 180-ton press. The
starting materials are the La₂S₃ (99.9

The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity ρ-T was
measured using a four-terminal method under magnetic fields up to 14 T
with a Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design). The
magnetic field dependence of the electrical resistivity ρ-H in pulsed
magnetic fields up to ∼56 T was measured by utilizing a nondestructive
pulsed magnet at the Institute for Solid State Physics (University of
Tokyo) using the four-terminal method. The duration of the pulsed
magnetic field was about 36 ms. In the electrical resistivity
measurements, the direction of current was parallel to the applied
magnetic fields. The temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling
(FC) was measured using a superconducting interference devise
magnetometer (MPMS3, Quantum Design) with applied magnetic fields up to
3 T.

## III Results and discussion

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility for LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ under a field of 0.5 mT. Below
11 K, diamagnetic signals corresponding to the evolution of
superconducting states are observed. The irreversible temperature
T_(c)^(irr), which is a bifurcation point between the ZFC and FC curves,
is 8.5 K. Figure 1(b) displays the temperature dependence of the FC
susceptibility for LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ with applied fields of 0.5 mT,
0.5 T, and 1 T. It is found that the superconducting states can be
destroyed by applying a relatively small field of 1 T. At the same time,
we clearly note that the onset of T_(c) is robust against the
application of high magnetic fields.

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity
for LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ under magnetic fields up to 14 T. The
T_(c)^(onset) and T_(c)^(zero) under 0 T are 10.8 and 7.7 K,
respectively. Here we define T_(c)^(onset) as the temperature at which
resistivity begins to decrease in the ρ-T measurements. Figure 2(b)
shows the enlargement of the temperature dependence of the resistivity
near T_(c)^(onset). With increasing magnetic field, T_(c)^(zero) is
largely suppressed and the zero-resistivity state is not observed above
3 T within a temperature range T > 2 K. In contrast, the kink observed
at T_(c)^(onset) under 0 T is robust against the application of high
magnetic fields and still observable at

14 T. As will be discussed later, the ρ(T) curves above 6 T show an
additional anomaly [see Fig. 2(b)]. To obtain further information under
higher magnetic fields, we performed the ρ-H measurements in pulsed
magnetic fields up to 56 T. Figure 3 shows the field dependence of the
electrical resistivity at 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, and 4.2 K. The onset point
μ₀H_(c2) (pulse) of the superconducting transition is estimated using a
criterion of 99

To analyze the obtained data of the resistivity under various magnetic
fields, we plotted the μ₀H_(c2) and μ₀H_(irr) estimated using
T_(c)^(onset) and T_(c)^(zero) in the ρ-T measurements in Fig. 4. The
μ₀H_(c2) estimated from the ρ-H measurements with pulsed magnetic fields
is also plotted in Fig. 4. The μ₀H_(c2) (pulse) agrees with the H_(c2)
(ρ-T). It is found that μ₀H_(irr) is much lower than μ₀H_(c2). This can
be understood by the large anisotropy of superconductivity in the
BiS₂-based superconductors. Recently, Nagao _et al._ reported that the
anisotropy of superconductivity in EO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ was quite large
and was relevant to those of cuprate superconductors [26, 27]. The
sample used in this study is polycrystalline; hence, the grain
orientation should be random. Generally, in the layered superconductors
with large anisotropy of superconductivity, the superconducting states
in the grains whose c axis is parallel to the applied magnetic fields
are strongly suppressed by applying high magnetic fields. It is
conceivable that the large suppression of the fraction of the FC
susceptibility at high magnetic fields is caused by the large anisotropy
of superconductivity in LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂. In other words, the
superconducting states for some grains are suppressed by applying
magnetic fields.

As shown in Fig. 4, the temperature dependence of μ₀H_(c2) shows an
anomalous curve with a characteristic field of ∼8 T. To clarify the
anomalous behavior of μ₀H_(c2), we analyzed the anisotropy of μ₀H_(c2)
using the method proposed by Bud’ko _et al._[28]. They showed that the
anisotropy of μ₀H_(c2) for the randomly oriented powder samples of
layered superconductors could be estimated by analyzing the temperature
dependence of the temperature derivative of magnetization dM/dT. In the
method, the maximum upper critical field μ₀H_(c2)^(max), which could be
regarded as the H_(c2) for the grains with a grain orientation of H∥ab,
can be estimated from the onset of dM/dT; we call the onset temperature
T^(max). The minimum upper critical field H_(c2)^(min), which can be
regarded as the μ₀H_(c2) for the grains with H∥c, can be estimated from
the kink in the dM/dT-T curve; we call this temperature T^(min). Since
the analysis proposed in Ref. [28] relies on the fact that the
polycrystalline sample under study is a single phase, we should mention
that the present polycrystalline sample was characterized as a single
phase except for tiny impurities of Bi₂S₃ by powder x-ray diffraction
[25].

The temperature dependence of dM/dT for LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ under
various magnetic fields of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 T is shown in Figs.
5(a)-5(d), respectively. As represented in Fig. 5(b), we clearly observe
T^(max) and T^(min) as observed in the MgB₂ and LuNi₂B₂C superconductors
[28]. However, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio becomes smaller at high
magnetic fields due to the large suppression of bulk characteristics of
superconductivity. Therefore, we discuss μ₀H_(c2)^(max) and
μ₀H_(c2)^(min) by analyzing the temperature derivative of the electrical
resistivity to clarify the anomalous behavior of the μ₀H_(c2)-T curve
under high magnetic fields. As shown in Figs. 5(a)-5(d), it was
confirmed that the T^(max) and T^(min) estimated using the dM/dT-T curve
almost correspond to those estimated using the dρ/dT-T curve under all
magnetic fields up to 3 T. Furthermore, the S/N ratio of the dρ/dT-T
curve is clearly better than that of the dM/dT-T curve. Therefore, we
here investigate the anisotropy of μ₀H_(c2) by analyzing the dρ/dT-T
data.

As shown in Figs. 5(a)-5(d), both T^(max) and T^(min) shift to lower
temperatures with increasing magnetic field. In particular, T^(min) is
rapidly suppressed with increasing field and becomes below 2 K above 4
T. Therefore, μ₀H_(c2)^(min) (0 K) is expected to be less than 5 T. At
above 5 T, we observed an additional inflection point in the dρ/dT-T
curves. Figure 6(a) shows the dρ/dT-T and ρ-T curves for
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ under

and 4.2 K.

a magnetic field of 8 T. The onset point $T^{\rm max}$ is still above 9
K. The $T_{c}^{\rm onset}$ (ρ-T) corresponds to the temperature at which
the value of the dρ/dT equals zero. The inflection point appears at ∼5.3
K; here we call this characteristic temperature $T^{\rm mid}$. Below
$T^{\rm mid}$, the value of dρ/dT begins to increase rapidly. At the
same time, the resistivity begins to decrease largely, which indicates
the evolution of the superconducting current path below $T^{\rm mid}$.
Figure 6(b) displays the increase of the temperature dependence of the
resistivity under various magnetic fields up to 14 T. The $T^{\rm mid}$
estimated from the dρ/dT-T curves using the same method as in Fig. 6(a)
is indicated by arrows in Fig. 6(b). With increasing magnetic fields,
the anomaly at $T^{\rm mid}$ on the ρ-T curve is more pronounced. Then
$T^{\rm mid}$ overlaps with $T_{c}^{\rm onset}$ under magnetic fields
above 10 T. It can be considered that $T_{c}^{\rm onset}$, which denotes
the evolution of the superconducting current path, corresponds to
$T^{\rm max}$ under lower magnetic fields, while it corresponds to
$T^{\rm mid}$ under higher magnetic fields, hence the anomalous behavior
of the μ₀H_(c2)-T curve shown in Fig. 4.

In Fig. 7(a) we have plotted $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm max}(T)$,
$\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm mid}(T)$, and $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm min}(T)$ with the
data points of μ₀H_(c2) (ρ-T), $\mu_{0}H_{\rm irr}$ (ρ-T), and μ₀H_(c2)
(pulse). The $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm min}(T)$ is obviously lower than
$\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm max}$ and $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm mid}$ at whole
temperatures and is located near $H_{\rm irr}(T)$. As mentioned above,
the low $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm min}$ can be understood by the large
anisotropy of superconductivity of LaO_(0.5)Fi_(0.5)BiS₂. Namely, the
superconducting current path can be easily destroyed under magnetic
fields for the grains with a grain orientation of H∥c. Next we discuss
the difference between $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm max}$ and
$\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm mid}$. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the temperature
dependence curve of μ₀H_(c2) (ρ-T) almost overlaps with the
$\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm max}(T)$ curve under magnetic fields up to 5 T. Then
it deviates from the $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm max}(T)$ curve. Interestingly,
the curve of the temperature dependence of μ₀H_(c2) (ρ-T) finally
overlaps with the $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm mid}(T)$ curve under magnetic
fields above 10 T. The observed anomalous behavior of the μ₀H_(c2)-T
curve implies that the superconducting current path is generated below
$T^{\rm max}$ under lower magnetic fields, while it is generated below
$T^{\rm mid}$ under higher magnetic fields. Therefore,

T, (c) 2 T, and (d) 3 T. In (b), the $T^{\rm max}$ and $T^{\rm min}$ are
indicated with arrows.

there should be a factor that affects upper critical field, except for
the difference in the grain orientation between H∥ab and H∥c.

To explain the difference between the two kinds of upper critical field
μ₀H_(c2)^(max) and μ₀H_(c2)^(min), we assume that the superconducting
states within the ab plane are anisotropic. The structure distortion (or
strain) could exist in the present sample of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂
prepared using the high-pressure-synthesis technique, as observed in the
previous high-pressure studies on superconductivity and the crystal
structure of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂[23]. Although the evidence of the
lowering of the symmetry of the crystal structure was not detected in
the x-ray-diffraction measurements, the broadening of the (h00) and
(00f) peaks was observed in the high-pressure LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂
samples [25, 29]. Therefore, it is conceivable that the crystal
structure of the present LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ polycrystalline sample is
not a perfect tetragonal structure. If the ab plane is distorted (or
strained), the superconducting states along the a axis could be
nonequivalent to that along the b axis. In that case, the upper critical
field for the a-axis direction and the b-axis direction could be
different due to the difference in effective mass. In addition, a
previous theoretical study suggested that the one-dimensional nature of
the Bi bands (Bi 6p_(x) and Bi 6p_(y)) provides good nesting of the
Fermi surface in the LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ system [14]. Furthermore,
Suzuki _et al._ showed that the band structure of the BiS₂ family could
be largely affected by the change in the local crystal structures [15].
These theoretical studies could suggest the possibility of the
appearance of the anisotropic superconducting states within the ab plane
when the degeneracy of Bi 6p_(x) and Bi 6p_(y) is lifted. Therefore, it
is conceivable that there are the different upper critical fields
μ₀H_(c2)^(a axis) and μ₀H_(C2)^(b axis) in a distorted (or strained)
Bi-S plane of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂. On the basis of the discussion, the
evolution of the anisotropic superconducting

states of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ under magnetic fields is summarized
below. All the grains are superconducting at
$\mu_{0}H<\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}$. At magnetic fields of
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}<\mu_{0}H<\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}$,
superconducting states of the grains with a grain orientation of H∥c are
suppressed. Then, under
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}<\mu_{0}H<\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}$, the
superconducting states of the grains with an orientation of H∥a or H∥b
are suppressed; we cannot distinguish the a-axis orientation from the
b-axis orientation within the results of the present study. Above
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}$, all the grains become nonsuperconducting.

To discuss the anisotropy of the upper critical field, we have plotted
the values of $\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}(T)$,
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}(T)$, and $\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}(T)$ in Fig.
7(b). The data points for $\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}$ and μ₀H_(C2) (pulse)
exhibit a linear temperature dependence. Therefore, we estimated
$d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}/dT$, $d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}/dT$, and
$d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}/dT$ by fitting the data points with a linear
function of temperature to discuss the anisotropy. The estimated
$d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}/dT$, $d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}/dT$, and
$d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}/dT$ are −7.05, −2.60, and −0.95 T/K,
respectively. The anisotropy parameter estimated using the values of
$d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}/dT$ and $d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}/dT$ is 7.4.
The anisotropy parameter estimated in this work is clearly lower than
the anisotropy parameter of over 30 for La_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ single
crystals (T_(c) ∼ 3 K) grown at ambient pressure [27]. This indicates
that the larger anisotropy of superconductivity is not essential for the
enhancement of T_(c) and the lower anisotropy may be important for a
higher T_(c) in LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂. Furthermore, the evolution of the
in-plane anisotropy within Bi-S plane may play an important role in the
enhancement of T_(c). To elucidate the mechanism of superconductivity in
the BiS₂ family, high-field studies using LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ single
crystals with higher T_(c) are needed. To achieve this, single crystal
growth of the high-T_(c) phase of LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ is required.

## IV IV. Conclusion

We have studied magnetic and transport properties of the
high-pressure-synthesized LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ polycrystalline sample
under high magnetic fields. The temperature dependence of the upper
critical field shows anomalous behavior with a characteristic magnetic
field of 8 T. We found that the anisotropy of the upper critical field
of the polycrystalline sample of LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂ can be estimated
by analyzing the characteristic temperatures on the dρ/dT⋅T curve. It
was found that there were three kinds of upper critical field in
LaO_(0.5)F_(0.5)BiS₂. The lowest upper critical field
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}$ is regarded as μ₀H_(c2) when the magnetic
fields are applied parallel to the c axis of the grain. The
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}$ and $\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}$ are regarded as
μ₀H_(c2) when the superconducting states are suppressed for the grains
with an orientation of H∥ab. The difference between
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}$ and $\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}$ could be
explained by the anisotropy of superconducting states within the Bi-S
plane, which is possibly caused by the lattice distortion or strain
within the Bi-S plane. Hence, the upper critical fields
$\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm max}$ and $\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{\rm h\,\rm max}$ are
different due to the difference in the effective mass. The fraction of
grains in superconducting states decreases with increasing magnetic
field on the order of 0 T, $\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}$,
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}$, and $\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}$. Above
$\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}$, all the grains become nonsuperconducting. The
estimated $d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}/dT$, $d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm mid}/dT$,
and $d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}/dT$ are −7.05, −2.60, and −0.95 T/K,
respectively. The anisotropy parameter for the upper critical field
estimated using $d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm max}/dT$ and
$d\mu_{0}H_{C2}^{\rm min}/dT$ is 7.4, which is clearly lower than the
anisotropy parameter of over 30 in the previous report for
LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ single crystals (T_(c) ∼ 3 K) grown at ambient
pressure. This indicates that the larger anisotropy of superconductivity
is not essential for the enhancement of T_(c) and the lower anisotropy
might be important for a higher T_(c) in LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂. Moreover,
the evolution of the in-plane anisotropy within the Bi-S plane may play
an important role for the enhancement of T_(c) in LaO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂.
