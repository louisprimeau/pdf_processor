###### Abstract

High-resolution thermal expansion measurements of single crystalline
BaFe_(1.84)Co_(0.16)As₂ and BaFe_(1.77)Co_(0.23)As₂ in the temperature
range 5 < T < 300 K are reported. The thermal expansion is highly
anisotropic, with the largest expansion along the c axis. Distinct
anomalies are present at the normal-to-superconducting phase-transition
temperature _T_c; the phase transition appears to be continuous. No
structural transitions are observed over the temperature range of our
measurements. The thermal expansion data and heat-capacity data acquired
on the same specimens are used to estimate the volumetric pressure
derivative of _T_c using the Ehrenfest relation.

The newly discovered iron-based layered superconductors include the 1111
family, _R_FeAsO_(1 − x)_F_x (_R_=La, Nd, and Sm) with superconducting
transition temperatures _T_c as high as 54 K and the related 122 family,
AF₂₂₃₂₃₂ (_A_=Ca, Sr, Ba, and Eu), which superconductor after doping
[25, 26, 27, 28, 29] or under quasi-hydrostatic pressure. [6, 7, 8, 9]
Within the 122 family, CaFe₂As₂, SrFe₂As₂, BaFe₂As₂, and EuFe₂As₂
exhibit a structural phase transition from a high-temperature tetragonal
phase to orthorhombic at temperatures of 170, 203, 140, and 190 K
respectively. [9, 10, 11] In the case of CaFe₂As₂, pressure suppresses
the phase transition. If the pressure is quasidrostatic,
superconductivity occurs. [7] If the pressure is hydrostatic, a new
low-temperature tetragonal phase forms, called the collapsed tetragonal
phase; this phase does not superconduct. [9] Nonetheless, stabilization
of the tetragonal phase appears to be a prerequisite for
superconductivity. [25] Could doping manages this while also adding
carriers to the FeAs layers, leading to superconductivity [5] at 22 K in
BaFe_(1.8)Co_(0.2)As₂.

In this paper, we present thermal expansion and heat-capacity
measurements of two compositions of superconducting
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ single crystals. Strong anisotropy between the
a and c axes is revealed in our high-resolution thermal expansion
measurements. The phase transition appears to be continuous, and the
samples are devoid of any structural transitions over the temperature
range (5 < T < 300 K) of our measurements. The thermal expansion data
and heat-capacity data acquired on the same samples are used to estimate
the volumetric pressure derivative of _T_c using the Ehrenfest relation.

Our investigation was performed on two single crystals of
BaFe_(1.84)Co_(0.16)As₂ [the length and width along the measured
directions for the crystals are 4.321(1) × 0.326(2) and 4.525(1) ×
0.193(5) mm²]. The lattice parameters for these crystals are a =
3.9534(7) A and c = 12.942(3) A at room temperature and _T_c = 21.5 K.
Two single crystals of BaFe_(1.77)Co_(0.23)As₂ were also investigated
[with length and width along the measured directions 4.441(1) × 0.176(2)
and 4.635(1) × 0.280(5) mm²]. The lattice parameters for these crystal
are a = 3.9519(4) A and c = 12.937(1) A at room temperature and _T_c =
16.5 K. The crystals were grown using the FeAs flux method. [5] The
smaller of the provided dimensions is parallel to the c axis. The Co
composition was determined by microprobe analysis using an electron
microscope with an uncertainty of about 5

pansion between the cell and sample.[12] The midpoint of the transition
in the thermal expansion coefficient, a bulk thermodynamic property, was
used to define _T_c. Heat capacity at constant pressure C_(P), dc
magnetic susceptibility, and four-probe dc electrical resistivity were
measured using a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System.

Figure 1 shows electrical resistance (main panels) and magnetization
(insets) for the two compositions investigated in this work. The current
is applied perpendicular to the c axis, in the plane of the crystal. The
magnetization was measured by cooling the sample at 0.5 K/min in a
constant magnetic field of 50 Oe, which was perpendicular to the c axis.
The obtained transition temperatures for superconductivity agree with
the _T_c versus composition relationship that was recently reported [13,
14] for Ba(Fe1-_C_o)2As2.

Figure 2 presents the linear thermal expansion normalized to the length
at 300 K, D_L_/_L_300, for the a and c axes of both compositions. The
same behavior was observed for the second crystal of each composition.
The relative changes along the c direction, over the entire temperature
range, are about three times larger than the changes along a. This could
be a consequence of the layered nature of Ba(Fe1-_C_o)2As2, with
strongly covalent bonds within the layers and rather weak bonds between
the layers. For both axes, the length decreases with temperature, as
occurs in most materials. Along c, D_L_/_L_300 increases in a dramatic
fashion on cooling below _T_c (see lower inset for both compositions).
In the a direction, a distinct change in slope at _T_c is also visible.
The measurements in the region 5.5 < T < 30 K were repeated at least two
times along each axis for each of the single crystals, with similar
results to those shown in Fig. 2. We see no evidence

BaFe1,84Co0,16As2 and the right panel shows the data for
BaFe1,7C00,23As2.

for a structural transition in the close vicinity to T_(c), which would
appear as a discontinuity in ΔL/L₃₀₀ and would indicate a discontinuous
(first-order) phase transition. It is interesting that ΔL/L₃₀₀ is quite
large along c with a variation between 5 and 300 K that is 35

The thermal expansion coefficient μ = (1/L₃₀₀λ_i_)∂ΔL/∂T is shown in
Fig. 3. In the subsequent discussion, μ is labeled with the subscript i
to denote the direction along which it was measured. We determined μ_(i)
by fitting the data in Fig. 2 using Chebyshev polynomials and
differentiating, as reported previously.[12, 16] This process includes
cross checking with the point-by-point derivative to ascertain that no
subtle features are overlooked.[17] In the vicinity of T_(c), rather
than using this fitting procedure, a point-by-point differentiation was
conducted because of the sharp nature of the phase transition. Behavior
similar to that shown in Fig. 3 was observed in all data collected on
the crystals. As anticipated from the ΔL/L₃₀₀ data, μ_(c) is
significantly larger in magnitude than μ_(a). The jumps at T_(c) are
clearly visible on the scale of Fig. 3; they are very anisotropic with
different magnitudes and opposite signs. The general character of the
data agree with some recent measurements[18, 19] for
BaFe_(1.84)Co_(0.16)As₂, BaFe_(1.852)Co_(0.148)As₂, and
BaFe_(1.924)Co_(0.076)As₂.

For a typical normal-to-superconducting phase transition,[16, 20] a
steplike anomaly (often referred to as a jump) is expected to occur in
the thermodynamic quantities μ and heat capacity C_(P) (see Fig. 4) at
T_(c). As a result, we believe the phase transition to be continuous
(i.e., second order).[21] The behaviors of the anomalies in μ_(a) and
μ_(c), where a positive jump occurs along one axis and a negative jump
along the other,[22] are common for anisotropic superconductors.
However, it is interesting that the volumetric thermal expansion
coefficient Ω = 2μ_(a) + μ_(c) (see Fig. 4) exhibits peaks at T_(c),
unlike the steplike anomaly revealed at T_(c) in the heat capacity
(lower insets in each panel of Fig. 4). This may be associated with the
large and strongly anisotropic anomalies in μ_(i) at T_(c), which when
added undergo a partial cancellation that develops into a peak. However,
a peak is also evident in μ_(c) for our BaFe_(1.77)Co_(0.23)As₂ sample
(see Fig. 5). This leads to a larger peak in Ω for that sample.
Furthermore, a slight peak appears in the Ω data[19] on
BaFe_(1.852)Co_(0.148)As₂. Based on the fact that no jump is observed in
ΔL/L(300 K), within our resolution, it appears that despite the presence
of this peak, our identification of the phase transition as continuous
(second order) remains reasonable.

BaFe₂As₂ is orthorhombic below  140 K and tetragonal above, and this
structural transition is _approximately_ volume conserving.[23] Our data
show that the extremely large first-order structural phase transition
of[23] BaFe₂As₂ is _entirely_ suppressed in our Co-doped crystals. The
fact that a moderate amount of Co doping, which is synonymous with
electron doping,[5] suppresses the phase transition, suggests that the
structural transition in BaFe₂As₂ is a type of electronic instability.
Such instabilities are not uncommon to arsenides. For example, MnAs
exhibits a transition from hexagonal to orthorhombic[24] that is
accompanied by a large volume change. Pressure can be used to tune this
transition, leading to an exceptionally large magnetocaloric effect.[25]
In analogy, quasihydrostatic pressure has recently been shown to
suppress the structural transition in the analog compound CaFe₂As₂
leading to superconductivity.[7, 9] These comparisons underscore the
fact that interesting physics often exists close to an instability.[26]

We now discuss some general aspects of the thermal expansion. Layered
materials are known to exhibit highly anisotropic thermal expansions, as
well as negative thermal expansions over some temperature ranges. This
is the case in YBa₂Cu₃O₇, MgB₂, Na_(x)CoO₂, and Li_(0.9)Mo_(x)O₁₇,[27,
16, 22] In MgB₂, the volume thermal expansion coefficient at T_(c)
crosses over from positive above T_(c) to negative below[16]T_(c),
similar to what occurs along c in BaFe_(1.84)Co_(0.16)As₂ and
BaFe_(1.77)Co_(0.23)As₂ (see Figs. 2-5). The nature of thermal expansion
has been theoretically investigated for the case of the layered material
graphite,[28] where the thermal expansion coefficient along the a axis
is small and negative, and the thermal expansion coefficient along the c
axis is positive, with about twice the magnitude of that along a.[29]
Theory attributes this to the out-of-plane vibrational frequencies that
are characteristic of layered materials.[28] This general behavior is
evident in BaFe_(1.84)Co_(0.16)As₂ and BaFe_(1.77)Co_(0.23)As₂, where
μ_(c) is large and μ_(a) is small.

Our thermal expansion and heat-capacity data can be used to calculate
the pressure dependence of T_(c) near P = 0 via the Ehrenfest relation,
which is given by

for BaFe_(1.84)Co_(0.16)As₂ (upper panel) and BaFe_(1.77)Co_(0.23)As₂
(lower panel). The upper insets in each panel show the region near
T_(c). The lower insets in each panel show the heat capacity C_(P)
versus T. The jumps at the phase transitions are indicated by the linear
lines (in red) drawn through the data.

$$\frac{dT_{c}}{dP} = V_{m}T_{c}\frac{\Delta\Omega}{\Delta C_{p}},$$

where P denotes the hydrostatic pressure, _Vm_ denotes the volume per
mole, and D_C__P_ denotes the jump in the heat capacity. For this
analysis, the jumps in O and C_(P) at T_(c) are needed. The jumps in
m_(i) are indicated by the linear lines in Fig. 5. Considering first
BaFe1,84Co0.16As2, after averaging the jumps, we obtained D_m__a_ =
-1.5(3) x 10-6 (an average of four measurements) and D_m__c_ = 3.6(2) x
10-6 (an average of three measurements). As noted above, the anomalies
are highly anisotropic, with opposite sign, and the jump along c is more
than twice as large in magnitude as the jump along a. The jump in O was
calculated from D_l_ = 2D_m__a_ + D_m__c_ to yield 0.6(8) x 10-6 (see
the inset of Fig. 4 for an approximate sketch of the jump in O). From
our C_(P) data, we extracted D_C__p_ = -0.471(4) J/mol K. As
Ba(Fe1,-Co2)2As2 crystallizes in the ThCr2Si2 structure with 2 f.u. per
unit cell, _Vm_ was calculated to be 6.09 x 10-5 m3/mol. Using these
values and Eq. (1), we obtained _dT__c_/_dP_ = -1.7(2.3) K/GPa.

For the samples with composition BaFe1.77Co0.23As2 and T_(c) = 16.5 K,
we note that the kink near 27 K in the _c_-axis data of
BaFe1,77Co0.23As2 (see Fig. 5) is associated with a slight change in the
warming rate. After averaging the jumps from three measurements along
each axis we obtained D_m__a_ = -1.8(3) x 10-6 (an average of four
measurements), D_m__c_ = 7.2(4) x 10-6 (an average of two measurements),
and D_l_ = 3.6(1.0) x 10-6. For this composition, D_l_ is dominated by
D_m__c_. From heat-capacity measurements, we found D_C__p_ = -0.281(3)
J/mol K. The calculation using these values, _Vm_ = 6.08 x 10-5 m3/mol
and Eq. (1), yields _dT__c_/_dP_ = -13(4) K/GPa. By comparing the
_dT__c_/_dP_ values for the two compositions, it seems reasonable to
conclude that D_l_ is dominated by D_m__c_ in BaFe1.77Co0.23As2 and that
this is an important contributor to the large negative _dT__c_/_dP_.

Measurements of electrical resistivity under pressure [30, 31] on
Ba(Fe1,-Co2)2As2 for 0 <_x_ < 0.1 revealed values ranging from
_dT__c_/_dP_ = 4.3 K/GPa for x = 0.02 to _dT__c_/_dP_ < 1 K/GPa for x =
0.099. A maximum value of _dT__c_/_dP_ = 0.65 K/GPa was observed for
BaFe1.92Co0.08As2. Thermal expansion measurements and the Ehrenfest
analysis found [18]dT_(c)/dP= -0.9(3) K/GPa for BaFe1.84Co0.16As2,
_dT__c_/_dP_ = -6.1 K/GPa for BaFe1.924Co0.076As2, and _dT__c_/_dP_ =
-1.8 K/GPa for BaFe1.852Co0.148As2.19 A plot of _dT__c_/_dP_ versus Co
composition (not shown) using the _dT__c_/_dP_ values determined from
thermal expansion measurements (including those herein) reveals no clear
trend, whereas a peak in _dT__c_/_dP_ versus x is evident in the values
determined by electrical resistivity.[31] Most notable is the fact that
the _dT__c_/_dP_ determined using analyses similar to ours reveals
_dT__c_/_dP_ < 0 while direct measurement reveals _dT__c_/_dP_ > 0.
However,

BaFe1.84Co0.16As2 and the right panel shows the data for
BaFe1.77Co0.23As2. The jumps at the phase transitions are indicated by

it has recently been pointed out that nonhydrostatic pressure conditions
can lead to very different results in CaFe₂As₂, which exhibits
superconductivity under nonhydrostatic conditions [7] and no
superconductivity under hydrostatic conditions using helium as a
pressure transmitting medium. [32] Thus, it may be prudent to wait for
more measurements to establish the source of the disagreement between
dT_(c)/dP determined under nonhydrostatic conditions [30, 31] and
dT_(c)/dP determined from thermodynamic analysis of thermal expansion
data (equivalent to hydrostatic conditions). [18, 19]

T_(c) increases with pressure in La(O_(1 − x)F_(x))FeAs (y=0.11) at a
rate of dT_(c)/dP=1.2 K/GPa. [33] In the case of SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(y)
(y=0.3) and Ba_(0.58)K_(0.45)Fe₂As₂, T_(c) decreases at rates of
dT_(c)/dP=−2.3 K/GPa and dT_(c)/dP=−1.5 K/GPa, respectively. [34, 35] It
has recently been shown that the sign of dT_(c)/dP depends on the doping
level [34, 36] and that T_(c) varies with carrier concentration in a
parabolic manner for some As-based superconductors. [34] In cuprate
superconductors, the parabolic behavior of T_(c) versus carrier
concentration is responsible for the systematic occurrence [37] of
positive and negative values of dT_(c)/dP. Presumably, similar physics
is at play in the FeAs superconductors.

Finally, it has become fairly common to estimate uniaxial pressure
derivatives [22] using the jumps in μ_(i) and C_(P). This analysis was
recently conducted [18, 19] using anisotropic thermal expansion data on
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂. Its use is based on an argument of Testardi,
[38] which neglects the off-diagonal elements of the stress tensor [39]
in calculating dT_(c)/dP. For example, if uniaxial pressure were applied
along c, according to the Poisson effect, the crystal must expand along
the two perpendicular directions. This fact is neglected in the uniaxial
Ehrenfest relation that is commonly used. [18, 19, 22] For this reason,
we have not produced such an analysis. A detailed theoretical
description of this is in preparation. [40]

In summary, our results reveal the anisotropic thermal expansion of
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂. The c-axis expansion is about three times
larger than the a-axis expansion. Furthermore, the c-axis expansion is
very large with a value for μ that is about 35
