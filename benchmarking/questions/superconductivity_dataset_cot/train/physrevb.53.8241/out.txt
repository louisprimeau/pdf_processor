###### Abstract

We report the discovery of a superconducting transition in the heavy-fermion compound CeRh_{2}Si_{2} under hydrostatic pressure. Superconductivity appears at pressures above about 9 kbar, near the critical pressure required to suppress antiferromagnetic order [_T__N_(_P_ = 0) = 36 K]. Onset of superconductivity occurs at a temperature of ~350 mK. Resistivity measurements as a function of field at constant temperature allow us to build an _H_*_-_T_ phase diagram for the onset of superconductivity. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the initial slope of the critical field leads to an effective mass of _m_*/_m_0 ~200, supporting the heavy-fermion nature of superconductivity in CeRh_{2}Si_{2}. Magnetic ac susceptibility (X_{x}) shows a diamagnetic response corresponding to about 1% of perfect diamagnetism. The size of the feature in X_{x} also is strongly peaked at a pressure of ~9 kbar.

## Introduction

Unconventional superconductivity is a very active area of research, both in cuprate and heavy-fermion compounds. These two classes of materials hold the possibility that the attractive interaction between charge carriers originates not from electron-phonon interaction, as in conventional superconductors, but rather from the magnetic fluctuations present in these systems. In heavy-fermion compounds these fluctuations are thought to arise primarily from Kondo coupling of partially filled 4f (for Ce) or 5f (for U) shells to conduction electrons.

The first discovery of heavy-fermion superconductivity was in CeCu_{2}Si_{2} (Ref. 1) with a transition temperature T_{c}  0.5 K at zero pressure. By measuring the magnitude of the heat capacity jump at T_{c} , the authors demonstrated convincingly that the phase transition developed out of a band of heavy quasiparticles. Subsequently, superconductivity has been discovered in a small number of U-based heavy-fermion compounds, namely, UPt_{3}, 2 UBe_{13}, 3 URu_{2}Si_{2}, 4 UNi_{2}Al_{3}, 5 UPd_{2}Al_{3}. 6 In some of these compounds, superconductivity coexists with a magnetically ordered state, with Neel temperature T_{N} about an order of magnitude higher than T_{c} .

Until recently, CeCu_{2}Si_{2} represented the only example of a Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductor. However, Jaccard _et al._7 have discovered that isostructural CeCu_{2}Ge_{2} also superconducts below T_{c} = 0.6 K at pressures above 70 kbar. Investigation of this compound was prompted by the systematic variation of the thermopower of compounds of the Ce_M_2X2 series as a function of the unit-cell volume. At low temperatures CeCu_{2}Ge_{2} has negative thermopower, as does superconducting CeCu_{2}Si_{2}, and a unit-cell volume slightly larger than that for CeCu_{2}Si_{2}. Applying hydrostatic pressure was expected (and observed) to further decrease the thermopower along a smooth curve passing through the data points for the Ce_M_2X2 series towards CeCu_{2}Si_{2}. At the same time, the Neel temperature of CeCu_{2}Ge_{2} was suppressed by hydrostatic pressure from T_{N} = 4.1 K at ambient pressure to zero, near the pressure at which the superconducting ground state appeared. Very recently another antiferromagnetic member of the Ce_M_2X2 series (where M stands for transition metal, and X is either Si or Ge), CePd_{2}Si_{2}, was also found to undergo a superconducting transition below T_{c} \simeq 500 mK upon application of hydrostatic pressure of more than 25 kbar. 8 This transition was identified as a drop in resistance of the sample below the detection limit. It is not obvious from existing data 7 that the same systematics of thermopower apply to CePd_{2}Si_{2}, and certainly not to CeRh_{2}Si_{2}, whose ambient pressure thermopower and cell volume would indicate that it should not become superconducting at smaller cell volume. In our investigation of CeRh_{2}Si_{2}, also a member of the Ce_M_2X2 series of compounds, we establish other systematic variations in the properties of these materials that may be a more reliable prognosticators of superconductivity.

The electrical resistivity of CeRh_{2}Si_{2} as a function of hydrostatic pressure was studied earlier 9 in a temperature range above 1.2 K as a part of an investigation of Neel transitions in the Ce_M_2Si_{2} series, with M = Ag, Au, Pd, and Rh. The _T_-_P_ phase diagram for CeRh_{2}Si_{2} obtained 9 indicated a strong nonlinear decrease in T_{N} as a function of hydrostatic pressure, which suppresses the magnetic order below detectable limits at a pressure of about 8.5 kbar. This raises the possibility of recovering a superconducting ground state which maybe suppressed by magnetic order at lower pressures.

## Experimental results

CeRh_{2}Si_{2}, as most other members of Ce_M_2X2 series, forms in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} body-centered tetragonal structure. The samples were prepared by arc-melting stoichiometric quantities of the elements on a water-cooled Cu hearth in an argon atmosphere. All of the elements were melted together during the first melt. The samples were melted and turned more than 10 times, removed from the melter, and crushed, and then remelted and turned at least 10 more times. The samples were about 20 g in mass. A vacuum was pumped quickly on the large buttons after the last melt to promote slow cooling, in lieu of a post-melting anneal. Pieces for measurements were cut from the center of the button. Powder x-ray diffraction showed no other crystallographic phases. Both resistivity and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in a self-clamping Be-Cu pressure cell,10 with fluorinert as a pressure-transmitting medium. A superconducting lead manometer was used to measure hydrostatic pressure in the cell.

The inset of Fig. 1(a) shows results of resistivity measurements as a function of temperature between 50 mK and 1.2 K on the first sample of CeRh2Si2. The two curves correspond to pressures of 8 +- 0.5 and 11 +- 0.5 kbar. This particular sample did not become completely superconducting at any of the four pressures studied. The pressure dependence of the maximum suppression of resistivity, shown in the main part of Fig. 1(a) as a function of pressure, is, however, instructive in that it shows a strong peak in the tendency toward superconductivity at a pressure of ~8 kbar, a value near the critical pressure required to suppress antiferromagnetic order in this compound.

Figure 1(b) displays results of ac magnetic susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac} measurements on another nominally stoichiometric sample of CeRh2Si2. The inset shows the magnetic response to a temperature sweep at a pressure of 9.5 kbar. The magnitude of the "diamagnetic" feature in \chi_{\rm ac} is less than 1%, estimated by comparing it to the magnitude of a signal from a similar-size piece of lead. The pressure dependence of the magnitude of the suppression of the \chi_{\rm ac} signal is shown in the main part of Fig. 1(b). Similarity in the pressure dependence of \chi_{\rm ac} and \rho, in particular the peaking of the relative change at 9 +- 1 kbar, indicates that features in both \chi_{\rm ac} and \rho are due to the same phase transition, namely, superconductivity.

Figure 2 gives resistivity data on a third CeRh2Si2 sample at a pressure of 11.0 +- 0.3 kbar. The inset shows data for a temperature sweep in zero magnetic field. The resistivity drops to zero within instrumental resolution around 200 mK, whereas the onset of the drop in resistivity occurs at 350 mK, with the midpoint at T = 260 mK. In the main part of Fig. 2 we plot the magnetic-field-temperature phase diagram for CeRh2Si2 at 11 kbar. Solid squares indicate the onset of the resistance decrease (_H_*, _T_) points, whereas open circles give (_H_, _T_) coordinates of the midpoint of the transition. The slope of the _H_* vs T data near T_{c}, \deltaH*/\delta T, together with values of Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma, T_{c}, and resistivity \rho_{0} above T_{c}, allows us to estimate superconducting and normal state properties within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory, as has been done for A 15 superconductors[11] as well as CeCu2Si2.[12] As input parameters we use _H_* data (H_{c2}^{\prime}= \delta_H_*/\delta T= - 14 kG/K) and measured values of \gamma= 80 mJ/mol K2,[13]T_{c}= 0.35 K, and resistivity \rho_{0}= 2 \mu\Omega cm. CeRh2Si2 at 11 kbar appears to be close to the clean limit, with the "dirty limit" term accounting for roughly 10% of H_{c2}^{\prime}. Au analysis following that done for CeCu2Si2 (Ref. [13]) provides estimates for the superconducting part of the Fermi surface, S_{s}= 3.1 x 1020 m-2, BCS coherence length \xi_{0}= 370 A, total elastic mean free path \langle_u_ = 2300 A, and Fermi velocity v_{F}= 9.5 x 103 m/s; these can be compared to S_{s}= 13 x 1020 m-2, \xi_{0}= 89 A, \zeta_{u}\approx 20 A, and v_{F}= 4.5 x 103 m/s for CeCu2Si2.[12] Using the room-temperature resistivity to estimate the Fermi momentum, along the argument of Ref. [12], we obtain k_{F}= 1.8 x 1010 m-1 and from the ratio k_{F}/v_{F} an estimate of the effective mass _m_*/_m_0 = 220 [k_{F}= 1.5 x 1010 m-1 and _m_*/_m_0 = 380

Inset, superconducting transition displayed in resistivity data at 11.0 +- 0.3 kbar.

  for CeCu2Si2 (Ref. [12])]. A variation on the expression for the effective mass given in Ref. [12] (valid in a clean limit),

\[m\ast/m_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{H_{c2}^{\prime}}{T_{c}}}k_{F}\,,\]

shows that the large effective mass is a consequence of a low-T_{c} and a steep _H_*_-_T_ phase boundary near T_{c}.14 Taking the slope of the midpoint of the transition with respect to magnetic field instead of \delta H\ast/\delta T (see Fig. 2) results in an effective mass ratio smaller by \approx 30\%. Likewise, taking the value of the Fermi momentum for isostructural CeCu2Si2 , instead of the estimate from the room-temperature resistivity obtained above, would result in lowering of the effective mass estimate by \approx 20\%. A factor of 2-3 difference in m* between CeCu2Si2 and CeRh2Si2 , in spite of the order of magnitude difference in \gamma [for CeCu2Si2 \gamma=0.7 J/K2 mol (Ref. [12])], suggests that heavy quasiparticles may be created on similar parts of the Fermi surface in the two compounds, but the fraction of the Fermi surface that is involved in that process is much smaller for CeRh2Si2. The value m\ast/m_{0}\sim200 obtained from this Ginzburg-Landau analysis supports the heavy-fermion nature of superconductivity in CeRh2Si2.

Footnote 14: Ambient pressure unit-cell volume from Ref. [17].

Because both complete and incomplete superconducting transitions were observed in nominally stoichiometric CeRh2Si2 samples, we also have prepared several off-stoichiometric samples, including Ce0.97Rh2Si2 and CeRh22Si2 , as well as CeRh3Si2 , which was identified as a trace impurity phase in heat-capacity measurements on CeRh2Si2.13 None of these samples show any sign of superconductivity in the pressure range where superconductivity in nominally stoichiometric samples was observed. This leads us to conclude that superconductivity is associated with stoichiometric CeRh2Si2 . In fact, different behaviors of nominally stoichiometric compounds indicate extreme sensitivity to composition, where slight deviation from exact stoichiometry leads to suppression of superconductivity. This behavior is reminiscent of that found in early studies of CeCu2Si2.1 We have recently learned that an attempt has been made to repeat the measurements on CePd2Si2,15 and superconductivity was not observed. Whether important criteria for good superconducting samples are precise stoichiometry, low residual resistivity, or perhaps some other property is an important question posed by our (and others') recent results, an answer to which may shed light on the mechanism of the superconductivity in these materials.

## Discussion

Figure 3 shows the resulting _P_-_T_ phase diagram for CeRh2Si2 . The superconducting phase appears in the vicinity of where hydrostatic pressure suppresses magnetic order below detectable limits. This is a common feature of pressure-induced superconductivity in CeCu2Ge2 and CePd2Si2 , both of which order magnetically at ambient pressure. The question remains whether magnetism and superconductivity coexist in the same crystallographic phase, which appears not to be the case in CeCu2Si2.16 An important criterion for the observation of superconductivity in CeM_{2}X_{2} compounds appears to be their proximity to magnetism, which suggests that spin fluctuations may be important for pairing. Further investigations of other members of the CeM_{2}X_{2} series may clarify this question.

Footnote 16: Critical pressure required to induce superconductivity.

It appears now that three members of CeM_{2}X_{2} series undergo a superconducting phase transition once antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by the application of hydrostatic pressure. There exists a qualitative correlation between the unit-cell volume of these compounds (Table 1) and the pressure necessary to drive them superconducting: The larger the cell volume, the greater the required pressure. This suggests that there is a favorable cell volume of 168\pm4 A3 in this series at which superconductivity chooses to appear. One would then expect other members of the series to become superconducting at pressures on the order of a few hundred kbar.

## Summary

We have observed a reduction of resistivity (both complete and incomplete) and diamagnetic response of \chi_{\rm sc} in CeRh2Si2 under hydrostatic pressure. Based on the pressure dependence of the magnitude of these effects, we conclude that they represent signatures of the same phenomenon, that

  of a superconducting phase transition. Several similarities are drawn among CeRh_{2}Si_{2} and other superconducting compounds of the CeM_{2}X_{2} series. It appears that in these compounds the antiferromagnetic order must be suppressed at least partially if not completely before superconductivity is observed. It remains to be answered whether CeRh_{2}Si_{2} is like most of the U-based heavy-fermion superconductors, in which superconductivity and magnetic order coexist. The superconductivity in CeRh_{2}Si_{2} is very sensitive to precise composition. We believe that the stoichiometric phase is responsible for superconductivity, and slight deviations from it result in suppression of the superconducting state. Further work is required to clarify these questions.

###### Abstract

We report the discovery of a superconducting transition in the heavy-fermion compound CeRh_{2}Si_{2} under hydrostatic pressure. Superconductivity appears at pressures above about 9 kbar, near the critical pressure required to suppress antiferromagnetic order [_T__N_(_P_ = 0) = 36 K]. Onset of superconductivity occurs at a temperature of ~350 mK. Resistivity measurements as a function of field at constant temperature allow us to build an _H_*_-_T_ phase diagram for the onset of superconductivity. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the initial slope of the critical field leads to an effective mass of _m_*/_m_0 ~200, supporting the heavy-fermion nature of superconductivity in CeRh_{2}Si_{2}. Magnetic ac susceptibility (X_{x}) shows a diamagnetic response corresponding to about 1% of perfect diamagnetism. The size of the feature in X_{x} also is strongly peaked at a pressure of ~9 kbar.

## Introduction

Unconventional superconductivity is a very active area of research, both in cuprate and heavy-fermion compounds. These two classes of materials hold the possibility that the attractive interaction between charge carriers originates not from electron-phonon interaction, as in conventional superconductors, but rather from the magnetic fluctuations present in these systems. In heavy-fermion compounds these fluctuations are thought to arise primarily from Kondo coupling of partially filled 4f (for Ce) or 5f (for U) shells to conduction electrons.

The first discovery of heavy-fermion superconductivity was in CeCu_{2}Si_{2} (Ref. 1) with a transition temperature T_{c}  0.5 K at zero pressure. By measuring the magnitude of the heat capacity jump at T_{c} , the authors demonstrated convincingly that the phase transition developed out of a band of heavy quasiparticles. Subsequently, superconductivity has been discovered in a small number of U-based heavy-fermion compounds, namely, UPt_{3}, 2 UBe_{13}, 3 URu_{2}Si_{2}, 4 UNi_{2}Al_{3}, 5 UPd_{2}Al_{3}. 6 In some of these compounds, superconductivity coexists with a magnetically ordered state, with Neel temperature T_{N} about an order of magnitude higher than T_{c} .

Until recently, CeCu_{2}Si_{2} represented the only example of a Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductor. However, Jaccard _et al._7 have discovered that isostructural CeCu_{2}Ge_{2} also superconducts below T_{c} = 0.6 K at pressures above 70 kbar. Investigation of this compound was prompted by the systematic variation of the thermopower of compounds of the Ce_M_2X2 series as a function of the unit-cell volume. At low temperatures CeCu_{2}Ge_{2} has negative thermopower, as does superconducting CeCu_{2}Si_{2}, and a unit-cell volume slightly larger than that for CeCu_{2}Si_{2}. Applying hydrostatic pressure was expected (and observed) to further decrease the thermopower along a smooth curve passing through the data points for the Ce_M_2X2 series towards CeCu_{2}Si_{2}. At the same time, the Neel temperature of CeCu_{2}Ge_{2} was suppressed by hydrostatic pressure from T_{N} = 4.1 K at ambient pressure to zero, near the pressure at which the superconducting ground state appeared. Very recently another antiferromagnetic member of the Ce_M_2X2 series (where M stands for transition metal, and X is either Si or Ge), CePd_{2}Si_{2}, was also found to undergo a superconducting transition below T_{c} \simeq 500 mK upon application of hydrostatic pressure of more than 25 kbar. 8 This transition was identified as a drop in resistance of the sample below the detection limit. It is not obvious from existing data 7 that the same systematics of thermopower apply to CePd_{2}Si_{2}, and certainly not to CeRh_{2}Si_{2}, whose ambient pressure thermopower and cell volume would indicate that it should not become superconducting at smaller cell volume. In our investigation of CeRh_{2}Si_{2}, also a member of the Ce_M_2X2 series of compounds, we establish other systematic variations in the properties of these materials that may be a more reliable prognosticators of superconductivity.

The electrical resistivity of CeRh_{2}Si_{2} as a function of hydrostatic pressure was studied earlier 9 in a temperature range above 1.2 K as a part of an investigation of Neel transitions in the Ce_M_2Si_{2} series, with M = Ag, Au, Pd, and Rh. The _T_-_P_ phase diagram for CeRh_{2}Si_{2} obtained 9 indicated a strong nonlinear decrease in T_{N} as a function of hydrostatic pressure, which suppresses the magnetic order below detectable limits at a pressure of about 8.5 kbar. This raises the possibility of recovering a superconducting ground state which maybe suppressed by magnetic order at lower pressures.

## Experimental results

CeRh_{2}Si_{2}, as most other members of Ce_M_2X2 series, forms in the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} body-centered tetragonal structure. The samples were prepared by arc-melting stoichiometric quantities of the elements on a water-cooled Cu hearth in an argon atmosphere. All of the elements were melted together during the first melt. The samples were melted and turned more than 10 times, removed from the melter, and crushed, and then remelted and turned at least 10 more times. The samples were about 20 g in mass. A vacuum was pumped quickly on the large buttons after the last melt to promote slow cooling, in lieu of a post-melting anneal. Pieces for measurements were cut from the center of the button. Powder x-ray diffraction showed no other crystallographic phases. Both resistivity and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed in a self-clamping Be-Cu pressure cell,10 with fluorinert as a pressure-transmitting medium. A superconducting lead manometer was used to measure hydrostatic pressure in the cell.

The inset of Fig. 1(a) shows results of resistivity measurements as a function of temperature between 50 mK and 1.2 K on the first sample of CeRh2Si2. The two curves correspond to pressures of 8 +- 0.5 and 11 +- 0.5 kbar. This particular sample did not become completely superconducting at any of the four pressures studied. The pressure dependence of the maximum suppression of resistivity, shown in the main part of Fig. 1(a) as a function of pressure, is, however, instructive in that it shows a strong peak in the tendency toward superconductivity at a pressure of ~8 kbar, a value near the critical pressure required to suppress antiferromagnetic order in this compound.

Figure 1(b) displays results of ac magnetic susceptibility \chi_{\rm ac} measurements on another nominally stoichiometric sample of CeRh2Si2. The inset shows the magnetic response to a temperature sweep at a pressure of 9.5 kbar. The magnitude of the "diamagnetic" feature in \chi_{\rm ac} is less than 1%, estimated by comparing it to the magnitude of a signal from a similar-size piece of lead. The pressure dependence of the magnitude of the suppression of the \chi_{\rm ac} signal is shown in the main part of Fig. 1(b). Similarity in the pressure dependence of \chi_{\rm ac} and \rho, in particular the peaking of the relative change at 9 +- 1 kbar, indicates that features in both \chi_{\rm ac} and \rho are due to the same phase transition, namely, superconductivity.

Figure 2 gives resistivity data on a third CeRh2Si2 sample at a pressure of 11.0 +- 0.3 kbar. The inset shows data for a temperature sweep in zero magnetic field. The resistivity drops to zero within instrumental resolution around 200 mK, whereas the onset of the drop in resistivity occurs at 350 mK, with the midpoint at T = 260 mK. In the main part of Fig. 2 we plot the magnetic-field-temperature phase diagram for CeRh2Si2 at 11 kbar. Solid squares indicate the onset of the resistance decrease (_H_*, _T_) points, whereas open circles give (_H_, _T_) coordinates of the midpoint of the transition. The slope of the _H_* vs T data near T_{c}, \deltaH*/\delta T, together with values of Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma, T_{c}, and resistivity \rho_{0} above T_{c}, allows us to estimate superconducting and normal state properties within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory, as has been done for A 15 superconductors[11] as well as CeCu2Si2.[12] As input parameters we use _H_* data (H_{c2}^{\prime}= \delta_H_*/\delta T= - 14 kG/K) and measured values of \gamma= 80 mJ/mol K2,[13]T_{c}= 0.35 K, and resistivity \rho_{0}= 2 \mu\Omega cm. CeRh2Si2 at 11 kbar appears to be close to the clean limit, with the "dirty limit" term accounting for roughly 10% of H_{c2}^{\prime}. Au analysis following that done for CeCu2Si2 (Ref. [13]) provides estimates for the superconducting part of the Fermi surface, S_{s}= 3.1 x 1020 m-2, BCS coherence length \xi_{0}= 370 A, total elastic mean free path \langle_u_ = 2300 A, and Fermi velocity v_{F}= 9.5 x 103 m/s; these can be compared to S_{s}= 13 x 1020 m-2, \xi_{0}= 89 A, \zeta_{u}\approx 20 A, and v_{F}= 4.5 x 103 m/s for CeCu2Si2.[12] Using the room-temperature resistivity to estimate the Fermi momentum, along the argument of Ref. [12], we obtain k_{F}= 1.8 x 1010 m-1 and from the ratio k_{F}/v_{F} an estimate of the effective mass _m_*/_m_0 = 220 [k_{F}= 1.5 x 1010 m-1 and _m_*/_m_0 = 380

  for CeCu2Si2 (Ref. [12])]. A variation on the expression for the effective mass given in Ref. [12] (valid in a clean limit),

\[m\ast/m_{0} = \sqrt{\frac{H_{c2}^{\prime}}{T_{c}}}k_{F}\,,\]

shows that the large effective mass is a consequence of a low-T_{c} and a steep _H_*_-_T_ phase boundary near T_{c}.14 Taking the slope of the midpoint of the transition with respect to magnetic field instead of \delta H\ast/\delta T (see Fig. 2) results in an effective mass ratio smaller by \approx 30\%. Likewise, taking the value of the Fermi momentum for isostructural CeCu2Si2 , instead of the estimate from the room-temperature resistivity obtained above, would result in lowering of the effective mass estimate by \approx 20\%. A factor of 2-3 difference in m* between CeCu2Si2 and CeRh2Si2 , in spite of the order of magnitude difference in \gamma [for CeCu2Si2 \gamma=0.7 J/K2 mol (Ref. [12])], suggests that heavy quasiparticles may be created on similar parts of the Fermi surface in the two compounds, but the fraction of the Fermi surface that is involved in that process is much smaller for CeRh2Si2. The value m\ast/m_{0}\sim200 obtained from this Ginzburg-Landau analysis supports the heavy-fermion nature of superconductivity in CeRh2Si2.

Because both complete and incomplete superconducting transitions were observed in nominally stoichiometric CeRh2Si2 samples, we also have prepared several off-stoichiometric samples, including Ce0.97Rh2Si2 and CeRh22Si2 , as well as CeRh3Si2 , which was identified as a trace impurity phase in heat-capacity measurements on CeRh2Si2.13 None of these samples show any sign of superconductivity in the pressure range where superconductivity in nominally stoichiometric samples was observed. This leads us to conclude that superconductivity is associated with stoichiometric CeRh2Si2 . In fact, different behaviors of nominally stoichiometric compounds indicate extreme sensitivity to composition, where slight deviation from exact stoichiometry leads to suppression of superconductivity. This behavior is reminiscent of that found in early studies of CeCu2Si2.1 We have recently learned that an attempt has been made to repeat the measurements on CePd2Si2,15 and superconductivity was not observed. Whether important criteria for good superconducting samples are precise stoichiometry, low residual resistivity, or perhaps some other property is an important question posed by our (and others') recent results, an answer to which may shed light on the mechanism of the superconductivity in these materials.

## Discussion

Figure 3 shows the resulting _P_-_T_ phase diagram for CeRh2Si2 . The superconducting phase appears in the vicinity of where hydrostatic pressure suppresses magnetic order below detectable limits. This is a common feature of pressure-induced superconductivity in CeCu2Ge2 and CePd2Si2 , both of which order magnetically at ambient pressure. The question remains whether magnetism and superconductivity coexist in the same crystallographic phase, which appears not to be the case in CeCu2Si2.16 An important criterion for the observation of superconductivity in CeM_{2}X_{2} compounds appears to be their proximity to magnetism, which suggests that spin fluctuations may be important for pairing. Further investigations of other members of the CeM_{2}X_{2} series may clarify this question.

Footnote 16: Critical pressure required to induce superconductivity.

It appears now that three members of CeM_{2}X_{2} series undergo a superconducting phase transition once antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by the application of hydrostatic pressure. There exists a qualitative correlation between the unit-cell volume of these compounds (Table 1) and the pressure necessary to drive them superconducting: The larger the cell volume, the greater the required pressure. This suggests that there is a favorable cell volume of 168\pm4 A3 in this series at which superconductivity chooses to appear. One would then expect other members of the series to become superconducting at pressures on the order of a few hundred kbar.

## Summary

We have observed a reduction of resistivity (both complete and incomplete) and diamagnetic response of \chi_{\rm sc} in CeRh2Si2 under hydrostatic pressure. Based on the pressure dependence of the magnitude of these effects, we conclude that they represent signatures of the same phenomenon, that

  of a superconducting phase transition. Several similarities are drawn among CeRh_{2}Si_{2} and other superconducting compounds of the CeM_{2}X_{2} series. It appears that in these compounds the antiferromagnetic order must be suppressed at least partially if not completely before superconductivity is observed. It remains to be answered whether CeRh_{2}Si_{2} is like most of the U-based heavy-fermion superconductors, in which superconductivity and magnetic order coexist. The superconductivity in CeRh_{2}Si_{2} is very sensitive to precise composition. We believe that the stoichiometric phase is responsible for superconductivity, and slight deviations from it result in suppression of the superconducting state. Further work is required to clarify these questions.
