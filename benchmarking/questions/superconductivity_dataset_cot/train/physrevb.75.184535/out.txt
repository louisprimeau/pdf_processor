###### Abstract

The superconducting properties of filled skutterudite La0.8Rh4P12 synthesized at 9.4 GPa and 1473 K using a belt-type apparatus were investigated by measuring the magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat. Filled skutterudite La0.3Rh4P12 is a type-II superconducting material with a critical temperature for the superconducting transition, T_{C}, of 14.9 K. The upper critical field H_{C}(2) and Ginzburg-Landau coherent length \xi(0) were determined to be 167(1) kOe and 4.41(1) nm, respectively. The electronic heat-capacity coefficient g_{n} and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} were 25.1(8) mJ/mol K2 and 459(12) K, respectively. Using T_{C} and \Theta_{D}, the electron-phonon coupling constant l was estimated to be approximately 0.7, suggesting that La0.8Rh4P12 is an intermediately coupled superconducting material.

Filled skutterudites, with a general chemical formula of _MT__A_X_{12} (where M, T, and X are rare-earth and alkaline-earth metals, transition metals, and pnictides, respectively), show a variety of physical properties, such as superconductivity,1 semiconductors,2 ferromagnetism,1 and antiferromagnetism,3 when the combinations of M, T, and X are changed. So far, 14 filled skutterudites have been reported as superconducting materials.14-15 Among them, La_{x}Rh_{x}P12, which was reported by Shirotani _et al._ in 2005, has the highest critical temperature for the superconducting transition, T_{C} (17 K).15 Details of the superconducting properties of La_{x}Rh_{x}P12, however, have not been reported.

Footnote 15: 1 netic field, which demonstrates that La0.84Rh4P12 is a type-II superconductor. A lower critical field H_{C1} determined from the initial deviation from linearity was approximately 70 Oe at 2 K. The temperature dependence of H_{C1} is being investigated in detail.

Figure 3 is a plot of the electrical resistivity \rho versus the temperature. The sample has a rectangular parallelepiped shape 2.45 mm in length, 0.91 mm in width, and 0.43 mm in thickness. The value of \rho is 3.173 x 10^{-4}\Omega cm at 15.3 K and 5.482 x 10^{-4}\Omega cm at 300 K. The residual resistivity ratio, \rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{15.3\text{ K}}, is 1.75. \rho shows a small decrease at 15.2 K and a pronounced decrease at 14.5 K. The width of the transition \Delta T (90%-10%) is 0.8 K. These results confirm that La0.84Rh4P12 is a superconducting material with a T_{C} of 14.9 K, as suggested by the magnetization measurements. This value of T_{C} is approximately 2 K lower than that reported in Ref. [15], which may be attributed to the difference in the La concentrations of the samples. The inset shows \rho for temperatures ranging from 2 to 20 K in field cooling at various magnetic fields. The symbols T_{C\text{on}}, T_{C\text{mid}}, and T_{C\text{comp}} represent the temperatures at which the value of \rho reached 90%, 50%, and 10% of that at 15.3 K at 0 kOe, respectively. Superconductivity was suppressed by the magnetic fields, which were applied parallel to the length direction.

Figure 4 is a magnetic field-temperature diagram deduced from the electrical resistivity measurements. The circles show T_{C\text{mid}}, and the vertical bars show T_{C\text{con}} and T_{C\text{comp}}. We determined dH/dT and T_{C\text{comp}} to be -12.0(2) kOe/K and 14.0 K from a linear fitting of the H-T_{C\text{con}} plot (broken line), respectively. The inset shows a reduced magnetic field h^{*} as a function of the reduced temperature t^{*}, where h^{*} =H/(dH/dT)T_{C} and t^{*} =T_{C\text{on}}/T_{C}. The broken line shows a linear fitting of h^{*} against t^{*}. The dashed-dotted and dotted lines show h^{*} calculated from the same h^{*} calculated from the same t^{*} dependence and deviates from the calculated curve when t^{*} is lower than approximately 0.6 for h^{*} in the clean limit and approximately 0.7 for that in the dirty limit. We, therefore, determined H_{C2}(0) to be 167(1) kOe from linear fitting. This value of H_{C2}(0) is approximately two-thirds of the Pauli limiting field H_{P} (258 kOe), defined as H_{P} =18.4T_{C} (kOe),[19, 20] which indicates an absence of Pauli lim

The symbols T_{C\text{on}}, T_{C\text{mid}}, and T_{C\text{comp}} in the figure represent the temperature in which the value of \rho reaches 90%, 50%, and 10%, respectively, of that at 15.3 K at 0 kOe.

  iting in La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12}. The Ginzburg-Landau coherent length \xi(0) was determined to be 4.44(1) nm using the formula H_{C2}(0) = \Uplambda_{0}/2\pi\xi(0)^{2}, where \Uplambda_{0} is the flux quantum.[21] The electron mean free path l was estimated to be 7.8 x 10^{-2}[S_{F}]^{-1} nm from the equation l = 1.27 x 10^{4}[\rho(n^{2/3}S/S_{F})]^{-1}, where r, n, S, and S_{F} are the resistivity at 15.3 K (in \Omega cm), the conduction electron density (in cm^{-3}), the Fermi surface (in cm^{-2}), and the Fermi surface of an electron gas of density n, respectively.[22] We calculated n to be 2.568 x 10^{23} cm^{-3} from the density, the chemical compositions, and the number of valence electrons of La, Rh, and P, i.e., 3, 9, and 5, respectively. Since the values of _S__f__F_ are 0.35 for Nb_{3}Sn and 0.5 for V_{3}Si,[22] we assumed the value of _S__f__F_ in La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} to be between 0.1 and 1.0, leading to a value of l between 0.078 and 0.78 nm. This value of l is smaller than \xi(0), which indicates that the sample is a dirty material.

Figure 5 shows the specific heat divided by the temperature _C/T_ measured at magnetic fields (field cooling) of 0 and 90 kOe as a function of the squared temperature T2. An anomaly attributed to the superconducting transition was observed at 14.2 K for 0 kOe and 6.8 K for 90 kOe, which is consistent with the resistivity data. The obtained parameters g_{m}, b, and d were 25.1(8) mJ/mol K^{2} 0.338(9) mJ/mol K^{4}, and 1.7(2) x 10^{-4} mJ/mol K^{6} respectively, by fitting the _C/T_ data at 90 kOe and temperatures ranging from 6.8 to 19.9 K with \gamma_{\rm{z}} + \beta T^{2} + \delta T^{4}. The Debye temperature, \Uplambda_{D}, was calculated to be 459(12) K from the value of b. We calculated the electronic specific heat of the superconducting state _C_es by subtracting the phonon specific heat _C_ph = \beta T^{3} + \delta T^{6} from _C_(0 kOe). After extrapolating _C_es(0 kOe) to 0 K, the difference in entropy between the normal and superconducting states, _S_es - _S_em, was calculated by integrating (C_{\rm{cs}} - \gamma_{\rm{z}})/T from 15 K to the lower temperatures, as shown in the inset. The entropy difference goes to zero when the temperature goes to zero, which confirms the thermodynamic consistency of the fitting. The value of g_{m} in the dirty limit also can be estimated from the values of _d__H__C_2/_dT_ and r using the following relation: -(dH_{C2}/dT) = 4.48 \times 10^{4}\gamma_{\rm{z}}\rho, where the units of _d__H__C_2/_dT_, g_{m}, and r are Oe K^{-1} erg cm^{-3} K^{-2}, and O cm, respectively.[22] The value of g_{n} obtained from the above relation is 13.6 mJ/mol K^{2} when the values of r at 15.3 K (3.173 x 10^{-4} O cm) and _dH_/_dT_ (12.0 kOe K^{-1}) are used. The values of g_{n} from the specific-heat measurements are 1.8 times larger than those obtained from _dH__C_2/_dT_ and r. One of the plausible explanations for this discrepancy is impurity phases contained in the sample. The existence of impurity phases is expected to change the value of r more sensitively than that of C. Since the oxide LaP3O2 is contained in the sample, the r of the sample is anticipated to be larger than the r of La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} itself. As a result, g_{n} is obtained from _dH__C_2/_dT_, and r becomes smaller than that obtained by specific-heat measurements because g_{n} is in inverse proportion to r in the equation.

In Fig. 6, the difference in _C/T_ between 0 and 90 kOe, [C(0 kOe) - C(90 kOe)]/_T_, is shown as a function of the temperature. The dashed line represents an entropy-conserving construction assuming that _C_es=_A_ exp(-_b/k__B_T_), where k_{B} is Boltzmann's constant. The transition to the superconducting state with an entropy-conserving construction gives \Delta C(T_{C})/T_{C}=22.9(6) mJ/mol K^{2} and _T__C_=12.9 K. The ratio of the specific-heat jump at T_{C} to g_{m}, _C_(_T_)/_g__T_, is calculated to be 0.91, which is smaller than the value of the BCS theory (1.43).[21] The electron-phonon coupling constant l was calculated to be approximately 0.7 from the semiempirical formula proposed by McMillan: \lambda = [1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln(\Uplambda_{D}/1.45T_{C})\rbrack/[(1 -0.62\mu^{*})\ln(\Uplambda_{D}/1.45T_{C}) - 1.04],[23] where _m_' = 0.1, \Uplambda_{D} =459 K, and _T__C_=12.9 K, which suggests that La_{0.82}Rh_{3.9}P_{12.1} is an intermediately coupled superconductor.

Table 1 contains a list of the superconducting parameters of La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} together with those of LaRu_{4}P_{12}, LaFe_{4}P_{12}, and YFe_{4}P_{12}, which have relatively high T_{C} values among the ternary filled skutterudite-type phosphides and reported superconducting parameters.[6, 10, 44] The electronic density of states _N_(0) was calculated from the relation g_{n}

  \pi^{2}n_{atom}N_{0}k_{B}^{2}N(0)(1+\lambda)/3, where n_{atom} is the number of atoms per formula unit and N_{0} is Avogadro's number.[21] The value of \lambda in the three materials was calculated using the above-mentioned equation. La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has a higher H_{C2} than LaRu_{4}P_{12}, which is consistent with the higher T_{C} of La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} because H_{C2} is proportional to T_{C}.[19] It is worth noting that La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has the largest \lambda among the four skutterudites. The largest \lambda in La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} plausibly explains why La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has the highest T_{C} among the four. The McMillan equation modified by Allen and Dynes is known to be a better approximation and to be applicable to larger values of \lambda.[25] In order to use the modified McMillan equation, information on the phonon density of states (a logarithmic average frequency of phonon) is required, but no information is available. The original McMillan equation is known to be reliable when \lambda\!<\!1, and the difference between the original and modified equations is approximately 10% in this \lambda region. Since the value of \lambda obtained here is smaller than 1, the results showing that La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has the largest \lambda among the four do not change significantly even when the modified equation is used to obtain \lambda.

In summary, La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} was synthesized at 9.4 GPa and 1473 K using a belt-type apparatus. The measurements of the electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat revealed that La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} is an intermediately coupled type-II superconducting material with a T_{C} of 14.9 K and H_{C2} of 167(1) kOe. A comparison of superconducting parameters between La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} and the other three skutterudites suggests that the relatively large \lambda in La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} is a plausible explanation for the fact that La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has the highest T_{C} among the ternary filled skutterudite-type phosphides.

The Ginzburg-Landau coherent length \xi(0) was determined to be 4.44(1) nm using the formula H_{C2}(0) = \Uplambda_{0}/2\pi\xi(0)^{2}, where \Uplambda_{0} is the flux quantum.[21] The electron mean free path l was estimated to be 7.8 x 10^{-2}[S_{F}]^{-1} nm from the equation l = 1.27 x 10^{4}[\rho(n^{2/3}S/S_{F})]^{-1}, where r, n, S, and S_{F} are the resistivity at 15.3 K (in \Omega cm), the conduction electron density (in cm^{-3}), the Fermi surface (in cm^{-2}), and the Fermi surface of an electron gas of density n, respectively.[22] We calculated n to be 2.568 x 10^{23} cm^{-3} from the density, the chemical compositions, and the number of valence electrons of La, Rh, and P, i.e., 3, 9, and 5, respectively. Since the values of _S__f__F_ are 0.35 for Nb_{3}Sn and 0.5 for V_{3}Si,[22] we assumed the value of _S__f__F_ in La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} to be between 0.1 and 1.0, leading to a value of l between 0.078 and 0.78 nm. This value of l is smaller than \xi(0), which indicates that the sample is a dirty material.

Figure 5 shows the specific heat divided by the temperature _C/T_ measured at magnetic fields (field cooling) of 0 and 90 kOe as a function of the squared temperature T2. An anomaly attributed to the superconducting transition was observed at 14.2 K for 0 kOe and 6.8 K for 90 kOe, which is consistent with the resistivity data. The obtained parameters g_{m}, b, and d were 25.1(8) mJ/mol K^{2} 0.338(9) mJ/mol K^{4}, and 1.7(2) x 10^{-4} mJ/mol K^{6} respectively, by fitting the _C/T_ data at 90 kOe and temperatures ranging from 6.8 to 19.9 K with \gamma_{\rm{z}} + \beta T^{2} + \delta T^{4}. The Debye temperature, \Uplambda_{D}, was calculated to be 459(12) K from the value of b. We calculated the electronic specific heat of the superconducting state _C_es by subtracting the phonon specific heat _C_ph = \beta T^{3} + \delta T^{6} from _C_(0 kOe). After extrapolating _C_es(0 kOe) to 0 K, the difference in entropy between the normal and superconducting states, _S_es - _S_em, was calculated by integrating (C_{\rm{cs}} - \gamma_{\rm{z}})/T from 15 K to the lower temperatures, as shown in the inset. The entropy difference goes to zero when the temperature goes to zero, which confirms the thermodynamic consistency of the fitting. The value of g_{m} in the dirty limit also can be estimated from the values of _d__H__C_2/_dT_ and r using the following relation: -(dH_{C2}/dT) = 4.48 \times 10^{4}\gamma_{\rm{z}}\rho, where the units of _d__H__C_2/_dT_, g_{m}, and r are Oe K^{-1} erg cm^{-3} K^{-2}, and O cm, respectively.[22] The value of g_{n} obtained from the above relation is 13.6 mJ/mol K^{2} when the values of r at 15.3 K (3.173 x 10^{-4} O cm) and _dH_/_dT_ (12.0 kOe K^{-1}) are used. The values of g_{n} from the specific-heat measurements are 1.8 times larger than those obtained from _dH__C_2/_dT_ and r. One of the plausible explanations for this discrepancy is impurity phases contained in the sample. The existence of impurity phases is expected to change the value of r more sensitively than that of C. Since the oxide LaP3O2 is contained in the sample, the r of the sample is anticipated to be larger than the r of La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} itself. As a result, g_{n} is obtained from _dH__C_2/_dT_, and r becomes smaller than that obtained by specific-heat measurements because g_{n} is in inverse proportion to r in the equation.

In Fig. 6, the difference in _C/T_ between 0 and 90 kOe, [C(0 kOe) - C(90 kOe)]/_T_, is shown as a function of the temperature. The dashed line represents an entropy-conserving construction assuming that _C_es=_A_ exp(-_b/k__B_T_), where k_{B} is Boltzmann's constant. The transition to the superconducting state with an entropy-conserving construction gives \Delta C(T_{C})/T_{C}=22.9(6) mJ/mol K^{2} and _T__C_=12.9 K. The ratio of the specific-heat jump at T_{C} to g_{m}, _C_(_T_)/_g__T_, is calculated to be 0.91, which is smaller than the value of the BCS theory (1.43).[21] The electron-phonon coupling constant l was calculated to be approximately 0.7 from the semiempirical formula proposed by McMillan: \lambda = [1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln(\Uplambda_{D}/1.45T_{C})\rbrack/[(1 -0.62\mu^{*})\ln(\Uplambda_{D}/1.45T_{C}) - 1.04],[23] where _m_' = 0.1, \Uplambda_{D} =459 K, and _T__C_=12.9 K, which suggests that La_{0.82}Rh_{3.9}P_{12.1} is an intermediately coupled superconductor.

Table 1 contains a list of the superconducting parameters of La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} together with those of LaRu_{4}P_{12}, LaFe_{4}P_{12}, and YFe_{4}P_{12}, which have relatively high T_{C} values among the ternary filled skutterudite-type phosphides and reported superconducting parameters.[6, 10, 44] The electronic density of states _N_(0) was calculated from the relation g_{n}

  \pi^{2}n_{atom}N_{0}k_{B}^{2}N(0)(1+\lambda)/3, where n_{atom} is the number of atoms per formula unit and N_{0} is Avogadro's number.[21] The value of \lambda in the three materials was calculated using the above-mentioned equation. La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has a higher H_{C2} than LaRu_{4}P_{12}, which is consistent with the higher T_{C} of La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} because H_{C2} is proportional to T_{C}.[19] It is worth noting that La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has the largest \lambda among the four skutterudites. The largest \lambda in La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} plausibly explains why La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has the highest T_{C} among the four. The McMillan equation modified by Allen and Dynes is known to be a better approximation and to be applicable to larger values of \lambda.[25] In order to use the modified McMillan equation, information on the phonon density of states (a logarithmic average frequency of phonon) is required, but no information is available. The original McMillan equation is known to be reliable when \lambda\!<\!1, and the difference between the original and modified equations is approximately 10% in this \lambda region. Since the value of \lambda obtained here is smaller than 1, the results showing that La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has the largest \lambda among the four do not change significantly even when the modified equation is used to obtain \lambda.

In summary, La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} was synthesized at 9.4 GPa and 1473 K using a belt-type apparatus. The measurements of the electrical resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat revealed that La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} is an intermediately coupled type-II superconducting material with a T_{C} of 14.9 K and H_{C2} of 167(1) kOe. A comparison of superconducting parameters between La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} and the other three skutterudites suggests that the relatively large \lambda in La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} is a plausible explanation for the fact that La_{0.8}Rh_{4}P_{12} has the highest T_{C} among the ternary filled skutterudite-type phosphides.
