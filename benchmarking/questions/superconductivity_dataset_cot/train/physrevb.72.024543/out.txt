###### Abstract

Specific-heat (_C_) measurements on single crystals of HfV2 were made from 1 to 150 K in magnetic fields (_B_) to 14 T applied along the [110] axis. The type-II superconductor HfV2 has a martensitic transition at _T_M ~ 118 K and becomes superconducting at _T_c ~ 8 to 9 K. Specific heats are thermal-history dependent and _T_c increases following repeated cooling cycles from ambient temperature through _T_M. This progression is probably related to an incomplete structural transition from cubic-to-orthorhombic symmetry at _T_M and the related strains that are produced. Differential scanning calorimetry through _T_M had a hysteresis of ~ 1 K related to cooling and warming cycles between 90 and 140 K with no other effect on the martensitic transition. An x-ray determination of phase contents for one sample was used to establish a ratio (~ 1 : 10) of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases below _T_M. Both phases are superconducting, but only a sharp, anomaly is observed at _T_c, which can be rationalized if both phases have nearly identical _T_c's. From fits to the specific heat above _T_c, a representative derived Debye temperature (\Theta_{\text{D}}), characterizing the low-temperature lattice specific heat, is 177 K. At _T_c the ratio D_C_(_T_c)/_g_T_c = 2.07, with _T_c = 8.00 K and g = 42.1 mJ K^{- 2} mol^{- 1}, is representative of the specific-heat measurements and indicates strong coupling. This ratio is nearly independent of variations in _T_c and C associated with repeated cooling from ambient temperature through _T_M. The conventional superconducting state specific heat can be fitted with the alpha model for strong coupling using an energy gap D(0)/_k_B_T_c = 2.1. It has an associated electron-phonon coupling constant l = 1.45. Both parameters are similar to those for the type-I superconductor Pb. In the normal state the Sommerfeld constant (_g_) depends on the thermal history, with a general increase as _T_c increases. For B > 0 the superconducting anomaly shifts to lower temperatures and the Sommerfeld constant in the vortex state (_g_) is linear in B with values and slopes that depend on the thermal history. Extrapolating _g_(_B_) vs B to g yields upper critical fields (_B_c2) ranging from 29 to 35 T.

## I Introduction

Superconducting transitions are preceded by martensitic transitions in certain compounds with the A15 structure (V3Si,Nb3Sn,V3Al), [1, 2] C15 Laves phase structure (HfV2,ZrV2), [3, 4, 5] and in the B2 cesium chloride structure (VRu). [6] They are all cubic at ambient temperature. Below the martensitic transformation temperature (_T_M) the A15 and B2 materials become tetragonal, while the C15 materials transform into orthorhombic or rhombohedral structures. The C15 Laves phase intermetallic HfV2 transforms from a cubic (C15, AB2 structure) to an orthorhombic (A15, O3_{h}^{3} symmetry structure) at _T_M ~ 118 K and exhibits extraordinary resilience to neutron-radiation damage. [7] At cryogenic temperatures it becomes a type-II superconductor, with _T_c ~ 8 to 9 K, and critical magnetic field, _B_c2 ~ 30 T. In addition to its resistance to neutron-radiation damage, the material softens with decreasing temperature [8] making plastic deformation possible at cryogenic temperatures. [9] Although HfV2 has been studied for over 30 years, the influence of microstructure on the nature of the martensitic transition and controversy over whether the superconductivity is conventional or unconventional continues to make it an interesting material.

Our goals for the research reported in this paper were fourfold: first, to use specific-heat (_C_) measurements to show how the martensitic transition is coupled to and affects the superconductivity and second, to obtain the entropy (D_S_M) and enthalpy (D_H_M) of the phase transformation; third, to identify the nature of the superconductivity; and fourth, to track the evolution of the Sommerfeld constant in the vortex state (_g_c) with magnetic field (_B_). All previous measurements [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] of specific heat used polycrystalline samples, or crystals with high mosaicity, in zero magnetic fields. In this paper we report temperature and magnetic field dependent specific-heat measurements on two single crystals, and on two polycrystalline samples for B = 0.

  

## II Experiment

Single-crystal HfV2 was made using the optical-floating-zone technique. As a first step, Hf (99.9%) and V (99.9%) in the molar ratio 1:2 were melted together in an arc furnace in an Ar atmosphere. Several polycrystalline buttons were prepared in this manner, and then combined in an arc furnace under Ar to form the feed rods for the optical-floating-zone furnace. The growth took place under an ultrahigh-purity Ar flow with the growth rate fixed at 6 mm h-1. The resulting sample was cylindrically shaped, ~2 cm in length, and 1 cm in diameter. X-ray powder diffraction measurements showed sharp Bragg peaks and a single-phase pattern corresponding to the cubic Cu2Mg structure. Laue patterns, taken on disk-shaped samples cut from the cylinder, confirmed its single-crystalline nature. From those patterns the preferred growth axis was deduced as [110]. Laue patterns taken in an area defined by a radius of ~0.2 cm from the center of the sample showed the same orientation, whereas patterns taken closer to the cylinder's edge showed deviations from [110] alignment. It was concluded that the cylindrical sample consisted of large, single-crystal grains with the same orientation confined within a cylindrical volume of radius ~0.2 cm centered on the core of the cylinder.

Measurements of specific heat were made on single crystals (sc1 and sc2) and polycrystalline samples (pc1 and pc2) with _B_|[110]. The measurements at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) were done with a physical properties measurement system (PPMS) and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) using a semiadiabatic, heat-pulse technique. The LBNL sc1 sample had a mass of 0.65 g from which a smaller piece of mass ~0.06 g had been cut previously for the LANL measurements. Combined experiments at LBNL and LANL for these samples covered the temperature (_T_) range 1 to 150 K in magnetic fields to 14 T applied parallel to the [110] crystallographic direction. Cooling rates for sample sc1 are given in Table I. All samples were field cooled prior to the specific-heat measurements. (In a separate experiment, two specific-heat measurements were made in 8 T: first, with 8 T applied after the sample had been cooled to 2 K from 150 K in zero field; second, after cooling to 2 K from 150 K in 8 T. There were no observable differences in the two data sets.)

A third single-crystal (sc3) was used for temperature-dependent x-ray powder diffraction measurements [17] to determine the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases for T < _T_M and the lattice parameters. The temperature range was 20 to 300 K for B = 0.

The martensitic transition was also studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to test for reproducibility and hysteresis in the transition for cooling/warming cycles. Measurements were done with a high-sensitivity calorimeter capable of working under applied magnetic fields to 5 T. [18] The time constant for the calorimeter is <10 s. The sample was a single crystal (sc4) of mass 0.06661 g.

The text, figures, and tables use the identifiers [LBNL sc1-1 or LANL sci-_n_], where i is used to designate the single-crystal sample and n is the number of times it was cooled through _T_M. Similar identifiers [LANL pci-_n_] are used for the polycrystalline samples.

The LBNL sc1-1 first stage of cooling was achieved by establishing contact between the sample and a 77 K heat sink using 2 × 10−4 torr nitrogen gas and mechanical heat switches. The cooling rate was approximately exponential and <1 K min−1 near _T_M. From 77 to 4.2 K the sample was in contact with liquid helium only through mechanical heat switches, and cooled to 4.2 K in ~4 h.

## III Measurements and Results

### Martensitic and superconducting transitions

The martensitic transition at T_{\rm M} has been reported to involve two closely spaced structural modifications from cubic to tetragonal to orthorhombic in the range 100 to 115 K.[19] It is not complete, and at low temperatures there is a mixture of untransformed cubic and predominantly orthorhombic phases whose composition depends on the thermal history.[16, 18, 19, 20]

One paper[20] reported that a polycrystalline sample of HV2 was cooled to a bulk superconducting phase in an untransformed cubic structure with a transition temperature T_{\rm c} = 8.1 K, which led to the conclusion that the superconductivity is not significantly influenced by the crystallographic structure. Since there is a wide variation in T_{\rm c}, depending on the thermal history, it would not be unreasonable to anticipate two anomalies, or at least a significant broadening of a single anomaly, for a mixed-phase sample. However, there is only one, relatively sharp, T_{\rm c} with a transition width \Delta T_{\rm c}\sim 1 K for all samples measured in this research, or for those reported previously by others. This can be rationalized if both phases have essentially the same T_{\rm c} and are influenced in the same way by the thermal history.

### X-ray measurements

X-ray powder diffraction measurements showed that the transition from the cubic to the orthorhombic phase at T_{\rm M} was incomplete, which will create grain boundaries and strains in the lattice that are probably related to the thermal-history dependence of, e.g., T_{\rm c}, \gamma, and \gamma_{\rm v}--Secs. III C and III D--where \gamma and \gamma_{\rm v} are, respectively, the electronic specific heat in the normal and vortex states. (The possibility of fracturing and/or micro-cracking at T_{\rm M} as a contributor to the variability in these parameters was eliminated through elastic-constant measurements that were made on a single crystal following an initial cooling from ambient temperature through T_{\rm M}. Those measurements would not have been possible if the single crystal had cracked or fragmented. Furthermore, it is well known that most martensitic transitions do not cause breakup of the sample.)

The x-ray determinations of the lattice parameters were made on sample sc3--ground into a powder and mixed with GE7031 varnish--from 300 to 20 K (see Table 2) during the first cooling from ambient temperature. (The orthorhombic a axis increased with increasing T while the b and c axes decreased. For the cubic phase the a axis increased with increasing T.) Two additional measurements were made at 140 and 40 K following cycles between those temperatures. The particle length below T_{\rm M} was estimated at 1 to 5 \times 10^{-6} m based on the absence of line broadening. Only the cubic structure was present at 140 K, but below T_{\rm M} both orthorhombic and \sim9 at. % untransformed cubic phases were present--independent of the number of cooling cycles. For a fixed T the a axis for the cubic phase and the a and b axes for the orthorhombic phase were not dependent on the number of cooling cycles; however, the c axis for the orthorhombic phase increased monotonically for each passage through T_{\rm M}. Presumably, different samples, or possibly the same sample following additional cooling cycles from ambient temperature, could have different ratios of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases. This ratio probably also depends on the physical state of the sample--powder, polycrystalline, or single crystal.

### Specific-heat measurements for B = 0

We report first on the PPMS measurements made on single crystal sc1 at LANL. Figure 1 is a plot of C/T vs T from 1.8 to 135 K for B = 0, which was measured following the second cooling of the sample through T_{\rm M} from ambient temperature. This was the only specific-heat measurement made to temperatures above T_{\rm M}. The superconducting (SC)

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} T (K) & a (Å) & V (Å^{3}) & a (Å) & b (Å) & c (Å) & V (Å^{3}) \\ T (K) & [cubic] & [cubic] & [ortho] & [ortho] & [ortho] & [ortho] \\ \hline
20 & 7.329(2) & 393.7(2) & 5.1730(5) & 5.2160(4) & 7.4051(8) & 199.81(4) \\

40 & 7.332(2) & 394.1(2) & 5.1743(5) & 5.2164(4) & 7.

 transition at T_{\rm c} = 8.45 K is in marked contrast to T_{\rm c} = 7.78 K following the first cooling from ambient temperature and measurements of specific heats in B = 0 and 8 T from 2 to 15 K. A total of six specific-heat measurements were made on the LANL sc1 sample following successive cooling through T_{\rm M} from ambient temperature, with an additional four made after repeated cooling from 150 K. The results clearly show that parameters characterizing the specific heat are dependent on the thermal history of the sample.

Figure 2 illustrates how T_{\rm c} for B = 0 depends on thermal cycling. When the sample is successively cooled from ambient temperature T_{\rm c} increases; however, when cooling is from 150 K there is no effect on T_{\rm c}. Other parameters affected by the thermal history are the specific heat of the lattice (C_{\rm lat}), the normal (\gamma) and vortex [\gamma_{\rm c}(B)] states, and, a small residual Sommerfeld constant (\gamma_{\rm r}) that is probably due to an electron density of states (EDOS) in a normal phase mixed with the majority superconducting phase of the sample. (Severe strains in small regions of the sample could completely quench superconductivity and lead to occlusions of normal material whose presence is indicated by \gamma_{\rm r}.) There is a general increase in \gamma (an increase in EDOS) linked to the increase in T_{\rm c}.

Specific heats for sample sc2 were measured at LANL from 1 to 150 K following an initial cooling from ambient temperature and four subsequent cooling cycles from 150 K. These measurements were made to test the effect of repeated cooling from 150 K through T_{\rm M}. To within experimental accuracy all of the data coincided with a T_{\rm c} = 8.1 K.

Polycrystalline sample pc1 was measured for B = 0 from 2 to 150 K. A second polycrystalline sample (pc2) was measured in B = 0 to test the effect on the specific heat after cooling to 2 K from ambient temperature followed by three

Successive cycles produce a monotonic increase in the c axis while the a and b axes are unaffected. For the vertical scales the number of increments and their spacing is the same for each axis.

(In the legend the temperatures given in parentheses are the initial temperatures at the start of the cooling sequence.) The results demonstrate changes in the specific heat in the vicinity of the superconducting transition as a function of the thermal history. There is a progressive increase in T_{c} and C changes for successive cooling sequences started at ambient temperature. For cooling cycles initiated at 150 K, both T_{c} and C are unchanged.

  additional cooling cycles through _T_M from 150 K. This was analogous to the test made with single crystal sc2 and gave similar results.

Various parameters characterizing the specific heat for sc1 and sc2 are collected in Table 1. For comparison, parameters reported previously by others for polycrystalline samples, and those for pc1 and pc2, are also listed in Table 3.

### Thermal-history dependence of _T_c

As sample sc1 was successively cooled from ambient temperature through _T_M to low temperatures, _T_c _increased_ as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1; however, successive cooling cycles from 150 K had no effect. It is tempting to associate these increases in _T_c with a change of the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases below _T_M. However, this would be possible only if repeated cooling from _ambient_ temperature--but not from 140 to 150 K--can reduce the ratio.

However, since both phases are superconducting, with essentially the same specific heat, it is assumed that the mechanism for changes in _T_c must be associated with strains originating from the incomplete structural conversion at _T_M. It seems reasonable to assume that the degree of strain is proportional to the amount of cubic phase below _T_M. (The x-ray measurements showed that only the cubic phase was present at 140 K.) Since subsequent cooling through _T_M from 140 to 150 K did not change either _T_c or the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases, the conclusion is that the strains did not change. It is hypothesized that warming to ambient temperature relieves the strains and "trains" the sample so that each additional cooling cycle through _T_M progressively decreases the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases and/or strains.

The lack of change in _T_c when cooling from 140 to 150 K through _T_M implies that the reduction of strain is an activated process. Strain-driven increases in the orthorhombic c axis with repeated cycling through _T_M (see Fig. 3) might provide a means for their reduction. A proposed mechanism would require the orthorhombic phase to retain a "memory" of the _c_-axis increase following cooling through _T_M, and the "training" would be identified with the monotonic increase in the c axis. However, for this mechanism to operate requires that cooling through _T_M must first be preceded by a return to ambient temperature, which is the activation part of the process. For this scenario, each additional sequence of cooling from ambient temperature through _T_M produces a _decrease_ in strains and an _increase_ in _T_c. (It is assumed, _a priori_, that a decrease in strain will increase _T_c.)

### Specific-heat measurements for B > 0

Three sets of specific-heat measurements were made at LANL on sample sc1 in fields to 14 T after the third, fourth, and fifth cooling sequences. The results for the fifth sequence are shown in Fig. 4 as _C_/_T_ vs T from 1.9 to 12 K for B = 0 to 14 T along the [110] crystal axis; results for the third and fourth sequences are similar.

Only a single cooling through _T_M--the first cooling of the large sc1 sample--was done for the LBNL measurements. Those specific-heat measurements covered the range 1 to 20 K and B = 0, 5, and 9 T and are displayed in Fig. 5. The widths of the transitions, particularly for B > 0, are relatively greater than those of the smaller piece measured at LANL. This could be a consequence of greater strains in the larger piece induced at the martensitic transition. In the case of the in-field measurements, it might also indicate misalignment differences of B with the [110] axis for the two samples. The data for B = 0 are given in Table 1.

### Specific-heat measurements in the vicinity of _T_M

The specific-heat data in the vicinity of _T_M are shown in Fig. 6 for polycrystalline sample pc1 and single-crystal sample sc1, both measured at LANL. _T_M is 117.6 K for the single crystal, as defined by an entropy-conserving construction, with the transition extending over ~10 K, as shown by the enhanced specific heat above and below _T_M. This broadening of the specific-heat anomaly reflects the series of struc

Although martensitic transitions are first order, the shape of the anomaly is lambdalike (unlike any previously reported), which resembles a second-order transition.

In contrast to the single crystal, the martensitic transition at T_{\rm M}=96.3 K for polycrystalline sample pc1 is sharper with a width of \sim1 K and a shape that is suggestive of a first-order transition. Previously reported specific-heat measurements [11, 12, 13, 15, 16] on polycrystalline samples have similar transitions, but with T_{\rm M} ranging from 114-118 K, which is comparable to that for single crystal sc1. Although the

Curves through the data are guides to the eye. The inset shows a plot of B_{c2}(B) vs T_{c}(B) where T_{c}(B) was obtained from entropy conserving constructions for B \leq 14 T. B_{c2}(0) at T_{\rm c}=0 was obtained from the linear extrapolation of \gamma_{\rm v}(B) versus B shown in Fig. 15. The curve represents a quadratic fit to the data.

Figure 6: (Color) A plot of C vs T in the vicinity of T_{M} shows the contrasting martensitic transitions for a polycrystalline (pc1) and a single-crystal (sc1) sample of HIV_{2}. The solid curves are from polynomial fits to the data, well above and below T_{M}, to establish “baselines” to be used in calculating \Delta H_{M} and \Delta S_{M} for the transitions, which are shown for LANL sc1-2 in the inset.

Figure 7: (Color) DSC curves in the vicinity of the martensitic transition at \sim115 K in applied fields of B=0 and 3 T for sample sc4. Arrows indicate the cooling and warming curves. The sharper peak is probably related to the cubic-to-orthorhombic transition and the long decay is a signature of an incomplete conversion of the cubic phase to the orthorhombic phase.

  polycrystalline sample pc1 has T_{\rm M}\sim 21 K lower in temperature than the single crystals it is superconducting. However, T_{\rm c}= 7.60 K is the lowest reported value and there is a large \gamma_{\rm r}= 11.7 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}. The second polycrystalline sample, pc2, has T_{\rm M}= 100 K (also low), with T_{\rm c}= 9.0 K, and \gamma_{\rm r}= 2.3 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}. Over an extended range above T_{\rm c}, the specific heats for samples pc1 and pc2 are essentially the same to within experimental accuracy.

The homogeneity range of HfV_{2} is only a few percent, and there is a sharp dependence of the composition of a solid on temperature just below the melting point. A possible explanation of the lower T_{\rm M}'s for the polycrystalline samples may be that their stoichiometry is slightly different compared to that of the single crystals.

An analysis of the single-crystal, specific-heat data for sc1 shown in Fig. 6 was made in the vicinity of T_{\rm M} to determine the enthalpy (latent heat) (\Delta H_{\rm M}) and entropy (\Delta S_{\rm M}) changes associated with the transition. A least-squares polynomial fit was made to the data from well above and below the transition region to obtain a "background" specific heat (C_{\rm bkg}). Integration of (C-C_{\rm bkg}) and (C-C_{\rm bkg})/T with respect to T gave \Delta H_{\rm M}=267 J mol^{-1} and \Delta S_{\rm M}=2.28 J K^{-1} mol^{-1}, respectively. Since an unknown amount of untransformed cubic phase is present below T_{\rm M}, actual values would be larger--by \sim9%, perhaps, based on the x-ray determination of the phase content of sample sc3-1.

A similar analysis was made for the pc1 data shown in Fig. 6, which gave \Delta H_{\rm M}=117 J K^{-1} and \Delta S_{\rm M} = 1.22 J K^{-1} mol^{-1}. These values are \sim1/2 those for the single crystal, which implies that either \sim50% of the polycrystalline sample is in the cubic phase below T_{\rm M} or is in a phase where the martensitic transition has been suppressed. Values of \Delta H_{\rm M} and \Delta S_{\rm M} were not determined for sample pc2.

Three additional cooling cycles for pc2 from 150 to 2 K, without return to ambient temperature, had no effect on C. If the assumption is correct that larger T_{\rm c}'s are associated with less untransformed cubic phase and/or lower strain, then pc2-1 with T_{\rm c}=9.0 K has less cubic phase and/or strain for the initial cooling than either of the single crystals or pc1.

### DSC measurements near T_{\rm M}

The reproducibility of the martensitic transition at T_{\rm M} was checked using DSC to measure warming and cooling thermograms between 90 and 140 K in magnetic fields to 5 T. Thermograms record the evolution of the transition temperature. The warming and cooling scan rates were 0.017 K s^{-1}. Since the time constant for the apparatus is <10 s the temperature was retarded by <1 K. Examples of the thermograms for fields of B=0 and 3 T are shown in Fig. 7. For all cases, the curves show a peak followed by a long decay. The existence of such a long decay is characteristic of systems for which the martensitic transition does not proceed to completion on cooling through T_{\rm M} because of the production of internal strains that oppose the transformation. Probably, some of this decay is also related to the conversion of the intermediate tetragonal phase to the low-temperature orthorhombic phase.

The temperature range \Delta T_{\rm M}\sim 9 K over which the transition takes place and the hysteresis \Delta T_{\rm h}\sim 1 K (defined as the difference in temperature of the calorimetric peaks for heating and cooling) are independent of B to within the accuracy of the data. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Since it is unlikely that a martensitic transition would be dependent on magnetic field, in the absence of a simultaneous change of magnetic order, any observed changes must be due to the number of thermal cycles that are associated with the changes of B at 140 K. The lack of a thermal-history dependence of T_{\rm M} from the DSC measurements between 90 and 140 K is similar to that found for both the x-ray and conventional specific-heat measurements that were made following cycling through T_{\rm M} from 140 and 150 K, respectively--see above.

## IV Analysis and discussion

### The lattice and electronic specific heat

Analysis of the specific-heat data in the superconducting region to determine \gamma and C_{\rm lat} utilized least-squares fitting of the data above T_{\rm c}(B) simultaneously for all B to the expression

\[C=\gamma T+\Sigma B_{n}T^{n},\] (1)

where the series B_{n}T^{n}, with coefficients B_{n}, is the harmonic-lattice approximation for C_{\rm lat} with n= 3, 5, 7, 9 and a fitting range of \sim9 to \sim 18 K. The electronic specific-heat component (C_{\rm e}) is obtained by subtracting C_{\rm lat} from C. In the plot of C/T vs T for the LBNL measurements shown in Fig. 5, the curve is the fit \gamma+C_{\rm lat}/T. From the coefficient B_{3} the characteristic Debye temperature (\Theta_{\rm D}) is calculated from the relationship

\[\Theta_{D}= [12\pi^{4}RN_{d}/5B_{3}]^{1/3},\] (2)

where R is the gas constant and N_{\rm a} the number of atoms in a formula unit. For the LBNL sc1-1 measurement \Theta_{\rm D} =177 K. For the six measurements made at LANL, \Theta_{\rm D} ranged from 167 to 176 K. Values of \Theta_{\rm D} were 162 and 167 K for polycrystalline samples pc1 and pc2, respectively. Previously polycrystalline samples^{10,13,14,16} had reported \Theta_{\rm D}'s that varied from 165 to 190 K. These variations in the lattice specific heat are compelling evidence that it is strongly dependent on thermal history and/or the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases. The first time the LANL and LBNL sc1 samples were cooled the rates were very different--see Table I. Since the \Theta_{\rm D}'s are nearly identical, it appears that the _number_ of times cooled from ambient temperature is much more significant than the _cooling rate_ in determining the low-temperature lattice properties.

For T=T_{\rm c} there is the thermodynamic requirement that the entropy of the superconducting state, S_{\rm es}=f(C_{\rm es}/T)dT, be equal to the entropy in the normal state, S_{\rm en}=\gamma T_{\rm c}. (C_{\rm es} is defined as the specific heat of the superconducting state.) Using the parameters obtained from a fit to Eq. (1), where \gamma is an evaluated parameter, will generally not result in equality of the two entropies. To achieve the required balance, a series of fits are made with \gamma constrained, which is system  atically varied in an iterative procedure for successive fits, until S_{\rm es}=S_{\rm em}. Figure 9 is a plot of C_{\rm e}/T vs T for the LBNL sc1-1 data; Fig. 10 is a comparable plot for the LANL sc1-5 sample after the data plotted in Fig. 4 were analyzed in a similar fashion. Before an entropy check can be made, the specific heat must be extrapolated to T=0; this procedure is described below. The amount of entropy involved in the extrapolation is a small fraction of that at T_{\rm c}.

### Nature of the superconductivity: conventional or unconventional

It has been reported [14, 16] that the specific heat below T_{\rm c} follows a T^{3} dependence, which was cited as evidence for an anisotropic, superconducting energy gap that vanishes at nodes (points) on the Fermi surface--a possible unconventional p-wave superconductor. Figure 11 is a plot of C_{\rm e}/T^{3} vs T at B=0 for the LBNL data shown in Fig. 9. Below T_{\rm c} the ratio C_{\rm es}/T^{3} is nearly constant to \sim4.5 K, but for lower temperatures there is a rapid departure from this T^{3} dependence.

Figure 11: (Color) A plot of C_{\rm e}/T^{3} vs T for the B=0 data shown in Fig. 9. This plot demonstrates the T^{3} behavior of C_{\rm es} below T_{c} to \sim4.5 K, which is characteristic of strong coupling. Below this temperature there is a rapid decrease that will be shown to be exponential in Fig.

  (The upturn in C_{\rm es}/T^{3} for T< 1.5 K is a consequence of an EDOS from a small amount of normal material--see the analysis below.) This plot demonstrates conclusively that HIV_{2} is _not_ an unconventional superconductor; the T^{3} behavior, over a limited region, just below T_{\rm c}, is not unusual and is related to strong electron-phonon coupling. (Strong coupling was proposed previously for a polycrystalline sample.[13])

Figure 12 is a plot of ln C_{\rm e} vs 1/T for the LBNL measurements for B=0 that show an exponential dependence of C_{\rm es} below \sim4 K. The BCS theory[21, 22] predicts that at sufficiently low temperatures C_{\rm es}=\,a(0)\,\gamma T_{\rm c}\,\exp[-b(0)T_{\rm c}/T], where the region of validity is usually divided into two sections--2.5 \approx\,T_{\rm c}/T\approx6 and 7 \approx\,T_{\rm c}/T\approx12--each with different values of the parameters a(0) and b(0). At limiting low temperatures C_{\rm es} for B=0 and C_{\rm ev} for the in-field, vortex-state specific heat can be fit by non-linear, least squares to the expression

\[C_{\rm ex}(B)=\gamma(B)T+\alpha(B)\exp[-\beta(B)/T],\] (3)

where \alpha(0)=\,a(0)\,\gamma T_{\rm c}, \beta(0)=\,b(0)T_{\rm c}. C_{\rm ex}=\,C_{\rm es} for B=0 and C_{\rm ev}, the vortex-state specific heat, for B> 0. For the LBNL sample sc1-1, in the range T_{\rm c}/T=2 to 5.6 (see Fig. 13), a(0)=11 mJ K^{-1} mol^{-1} and b(0)=1.71 K, which are comparable to the BCS values 8.5 mJ K^{-1} mol^{-1} and 1.44 K, respectively. Similar values are obtained for the LANL sc1-5 measurements although the fit range is truncated to T_{\rm c}/T=2 to 4 because the measurements are limited to \sim2 K. Equation (3) is also used to extrapolate C_{\rm e}(B) to T=0, albeit without theoretical justification. The results of the fits and extrapolations for the LBNL and LANL data are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively, where the fit parameters are tabulated. Gap parameters \beta(B) and prefactors \alpha(B) both decrease with increasing B. For both sets of measurements the entropies above T_{\rm c} agree for all B to within experimental accuracy as required by the third law of thermodynamics. The entropy checks for the LBNL data for sample sc1-1 are given in Fig. 9.

Sommerfeld constant \gamma vs B and the upper (B_{\rm c2}) and lower (B_{\rm c1}) critical fields

The simplest explanation for a residual linear in T term for B=0 is the presence of an EDOS from normal material, which is characterized by a Sommerfeld constant \gamma_{\rm r}. All \gamma_{\rm r}'s for the single-crystal measurements on sc1 and sc2 were small (varying from 0 to 2.4 mJ K^{-1} mol^{-1}--see Table 1). However, for the polycrystalline sample pc1 \gamma_{\rm r} = 11.7 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} implying that \sim21% of the sample remained in the normal state. Polycrystalline sample pc2 had \gamma_{\rm r}=2.3 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}.

The Sommerfeld constants for B> 0, obtained from the fits using Eq. (3), are composites of \gamma_{\rm r}= \gamma(0) from normal

Figure 14: (Color) A plot of C_{\rm es}/T vs T for the specific-heat data shown is in Fig. 10, which is similar to that of Fig. 13. The fitting expression and parameters are given in the figure. Extrapolations are over longer ranges of temperature than in Fig. 13 because the PPMS cryostat used for the measurements has a limiting lower temperature of \sim2 K.

Figure 12: (Color) A plot of ln[C_{\rm c}] vs 1/T shows the exponential dependence of C_{\rm es} below \sim4.5 K, where the specific-heat data are those for B=0 shown in Fig. 9. The departure of the data from the fit line below \sim1.4 K is the result of a lowered precision of C_{\rm es} as T approaches zero.

Figure 13: (Color) A plot of C_{\rm es}/T vs T for B=0, 5, and 9 T, which illustrates the results of an exponential fit and extrapolation of the electronic specific-heat data shown in Fig. 9. The fitting expression and parameters are given in the figure.

  material and \gamma_{\rm v}^{\prime}(B) from the vortex state. They are corrected to values corresponding to a fully superconducting sample using the relationship \gamma_{\rm v}(B) = [\gamma_{\rm v}^{\prime}(B) - \gamma_{\rm v}\rbrack/(1 - \gamma_{\rm v}/\gamma) and are plotted in Figs. 15 as \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B. For each cooling sequence through T_{\rm M} from ambient temperature, a plot of \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B is linear, to within experimental accuracy, but with different slopes [d\gamma_{\rm v}(B)/dB] and corresponding values of \gamma--see Table 1 and Fig. 15. As the number of times cooled from ambient temperature through T_{\rm M}_increases_, d\gamma_{\rm v}(B)/dB_decreases_.

If the linear relationship holds to the normal state \gamma, the extrapolated upper critical fields (B_{\rm c2}) range from 28.6 to 33.6 to 35.4 T for the cooling sequences LBNL sc1-1 and LANL sc1-3,5, respectively. [Because of a malfunction of the PPMS on the fourth cooling (sc1-4), no B = 0 specific-heat measurements were made, and \gamma_{\rm v} was not determined; however, a plot of \gamma_{\rm v}^{\prime}(B) vs B--not shown in Fig. 15--was linear.] For a polycrystalline sample of Hf0.4Zr0.6V2, with T_{\rm c}= 10.1 K, B_{\rm c2} was reported [23] to be 28 T. ZrV2 has the same crystal structure as HfV2 and both undergo martensitic transitions. At 0.005 T an M vs B measurement, where M is the magnetic moment, gave a T_{\rm c} of 7.7 K for the first cooling through T_{\rm M}. This is comparable to T_{\rm c} = 7.78 K for the first cooling of HfV2. Consequently, the B_{\rm c2}(0) = 28 T for Hf0.4Zr0.6V2 is probably similar to that for HfV2, which provides supporting evidence that \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B is linear to \gamma.

In the vortex state for a type-II superconductor, for B near the lower critical field (B_{\rm c1}), the theory [24] predicts that \gamma_{\rm v}(B) versus B will be strongly nonlinear (downward curvature) because of vortex-vortex interactions, and will approach linearity only when B \ggB_{\rm c1}. If vortex-vortex interactions are absent, or negligible, \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B is linear. [24]

The magnetic susceptibility of a HfV2 single crystal was measured as a function of B following zero-field cooling to 1.9 K. A plot of M vs B was linear to \sim0.02 T with a minimum at 0.046 T. B_{\rm c1} is estimated to be \sim0.02 T, but see Sec. IV D for another estimate using the thermodynamic critical field (B_{\rm c}). (A more precise value of B_{\rm c1} is not possible from the M vs H measurements since the sample is a single crystal of approximately cubic dimension that is not uniformly magnetized, which would cause inhomogeneous flux penetration and exclusion. Another complication is hysteresis produced by pinning.) However, since the lowest in-field measurement of specific heat for sample sc1-3 was at 0.5 T--more than an order of magnitude greater than the minimum in M vs B at 0.046 T--a departure from linearity for \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B would not be expected, nor was one observed.

### Thermodynamic critical field (B_{\rm c}) and related parameters

The thermodynamic critical field is defined for B = 0 as

\[(V/8\,\pi)B_{\rm c}(T)^{2} = G_{\rm es}(T) - G_{\rm en}(T) = - \int_{0}^{T}[S_{\rm es}(T) - \gamma T]dT,\]

where V is the molar volume and G the Gibbs free energy for the superconducting, G_{\rm es}, and normal, G_{\rm en}, states, respectively. At T_{\rm c} the free energies of the superconducting and normal states are equal and by setting G_{\rm es}(T_{\rm c}) - G_{\rm en}(T_{\rm c}) = 0 the integration constant is determined. The unit cell contains four HfV2 molecules and its volume is given as a function of temperature in Table 2, from which V = 30.1 cm^{3} mol^{-1}. G_{\rm en}(T) - G_{\rm en}(T) was calculated from the specific-heat data for LBNL sc1-1 (T_{\rm c}=8.00 K and \gamma=42.1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}). At T =0, B_{\rm c}(0) = 0.245 T and the curve of B_{\rm c}(T) versus T can be fit to within 0.3% to the two-fluid model, parabolic expression

\[B_{\rm c}(T) = B_{\rm c}(0)[1 - (T/T_{\rm c})^{2}] = 0.245[1 - (T/8.00)^{2}].\]

Equation (5) is not a good representation for BCS superconductors, but for very strong coupling, as in the present case, C_{\rm es} \propto T^{3} near T_{\rm c} (see Fig. 11) and the fit is improved. Unlike B_{\rm c2}(T) vs T and B_{\rm c1}(T) vs T, there is no change in properties when the B_{\rm c}(T) boundary is crossed. However, it is related to B_{\rm c1} and B_{\rm c2} by characteristic superconducting parameters that are associated with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity [25]

\[B_{\rm c2} = (2)^{1/2}\kappa B_{\rm c} = \Phi_{0}/2\,\pi\xi^{2} = 4\,\pi\lambda_{p}^{2}B_{\rm c}^{2}/\Phi_{0}\]

and

\[B_{\rm c1} \approx [ \ln\kappa/(2)^{1/2}\kappa]B_{\rm c},\]

where \xi is the coherence length, \lambda_{\rm p} the penetration depth, \kappa = \lambda_{\rm p}/\xi (\kappa < 1 for type-I and \kappa > 1 for type-II superconductors), and \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum (2.07\times 10^{-11} T cm^{2}).

Using B_{\rm c2}(0) = 22.6 T from the extrapolation of \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B for LBNL sc1-1 and B_{\rm c}(0) = 0.245 T gave: \kappa(0) = 82, \xi(0) = 34 A, \lambda_{\rm p}(0) = 2800 A, and B_{\rm c1}(0) = 0.009 T. A similar fit to the LANL sc1-5 data (T_{\rm c} = 8.60 K and \gamma = 45.9 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}) using the extrapolated B_{\rm c2}(0) = 35.4 T gave: B_{\rm c}(0) = 0.279 T, \kappa(0) = 90, \xi(0) = 31 A, \lambda_{\rm p}(0) = 2740 A, and B_{\rm c1}(0) = 0.01 T. The fit of B_{\rm c}(T) vs T for LANL sc1-5 to Eq. (5) was similar to that of LBNL sc1-1: B_{\rm c}(T) = 0.280[1 -(7/8.61)^{2}].

The lower critical field, B_{\rm c1}(0), calculated from Eq. (7) is less well determined than the other parameters. Nevertheless, it is not inconsistent with B_{\rm c1}(0) < 0.02 T estimated from the M vs B measurements at 1.9 K.

The coherence length \xi, is much smaller than the grain size of 1 to 5 microns (10 000 to 50 000 A) estimated from the x-ray measurements below T_{M} . Consequently, the proximity effect can not be invoked to explain the presence of a single, sharp anomaly at T_{\rm c} for a mixture of cubic and orthorhombic phases.

### The discontinuity in specific heat at T_{\rm c}

Figure 16 is a plot of C_{\rm c}/T vs T for the LBNL measurements on sc1 made for B = 0, where the transition to the superconducting state has a width \Delta T_{\rm c}\sim 1 K. The C_{\rm es}/T data below T_{\rm c} are corrected and normalized to that for a fully superconducting sample by subtracting \gamma_{\rm r} =0.5 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and dividing by the factor (1 - \gamma_{\rm r}/\gamma). An entropy-conserving construction defines T_{\rm c}=8.00 K and the size of the discontinuity \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}= 87.1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} for an ideal superconducting transition. The scaled discontinuity

 at T_{\rm c}, \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} = 2.07, is indicative of strong electron-phonon coupling, which is in accord with the T^{3} dependence near T_{\rm c} shown in Fig. 11. A BCS curve, where \Delta(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} = 1.43, is shown for comparison. Although both T_{\rm c} and \gamma are dependent on the cooling sequence for sample sc1 (they range from 7.8 to 9.0 K and 42.1 to 53.8 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}, respectively), the values of \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} have a smaller variation--1.95 to 2.10--to within approximately the accuracy of the various measurements--see Table 1. Samples sc2, pc1, and pc2 also have \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} values of 1.99, 1.95, and 1.93, respectively. If different samples have different ratios of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases below T_{\rm M}, this observation supports the argument that superconductivity in HfV_{2} is essentially independent of the crystallographic phase.[16, 20] [For other polycrystalline samples, reported previously,[10, 13, 14, 15, 16]\Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} ranges from 1.7 to 2.0.] For comparison Pb, which is a strongly coupled type-I superconductor,[26] has T_{\rm c} = 7.19 K and \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c}=2.65.

### F. Fit of C_{\rm es} to the \alpha model for B=0

A semiempirical modification of the BCS formalism, the \alpha model,[27] was developed to enable a quantitative fit of the specific heat of strongly coupled, single-gap superconductors. (This interpretation was recently extended to two-gap superconductors[28] and was successfully applied to MgB_{2}.) In the \alpha model's phenomenological modification of the BCS theory the superconducting energy-gap ratio, \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{\rm c} (k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant), is used as a fitting variable in place of the lower-bound BCS value 1.764; however, the temperature dependence of the gap is assumed to be the same

Figure 16: (Color) A plot of C_{\rm c}/T vs T for B=0, for the larger single-crystal piece (sc1) of HfV_{2} measured at LBNL, with an entropy-conserving construction that defines T_{\rm c}. The data have been corrected, as discussed in the text, for the EDOS of the small amount of assumed normal material. The BCS specific-heat curve is shown for comparison. The increased height of the anomaly, compared to that for a BCS superconductor, indicates strong electron-phonon coupling.

Figure 17: (Color) This plot illustrates the fit of the LBNL sc1-1 C_{\rm es} data shown in Fig. 16 to the \alpha model, a phenomenological modification of the BCS theory that is applicable to strongly coupled superconductors. The fit is excellent and the superconducting energy-gap ratio of 2.1 is nearly identical to the 2.2 energy-gap ratio for the type-1 superconductor Pb. The BCS curve is included for comparison.

Figure 15: (Color) Plots of \gamma_{\rm p}(B) vs B determined for B[[110] axis. From bottom-to-top the data are from LBNL sc1-1, LANL sc1-3, and LANL sc1-5. While \gamma_{\rm p} is linear in B, \gamma_{\rm p}(B), and d\gamma_{\rm p}(B)/dB are dependent on the thermal history. The upper critical field (B_{c2}) is evaluated assuming the linear relationship holds to \gamma. The differences in \gamma and B_{c2} are probably attributable to different ratios of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases and/or variations of the stress fields developed at the martensitic transition.

  as that of the BCS theory. Figure 17 shows the \alpha-model fit to the LBNL specific-heat data for sc1. The fit uses a gap ratio \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{\rm c}=2.1, and it agrees well with the normalized C_{\rm ss} data. This energy gap ratio is nearly identical to the 2.2 for Pb.[29] For comparison, the BCS curve is also shown in Fig. 17. The LANL data for sc1, sc2, pc1, and pc2 can also be fit by the \alpha model with very similar results.

### Electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda

Band-structure calculations have been reported[30] for HV2 in the cubic C15 Lawes phase that give a bare density of states at the Fermi level N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F})=197.9 states Ry^{-1} (primitive unit cell)^{-1}. Since there are two HV2 formula units in a primitive unit cell, N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F})=99.0 states Ry^{-1} (HfV2)^{-1}. The relationships between N(E_{\rm F}), and the bare density of states \gamma_{b} are given by

\[N(E_{\rm F})=(1+\lambda)N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F})=(3/\pi^{2}k_{B})(1+\lambda)\gamma _{\rm b}=(3/\pi^{2}k_{\rm B})\gamma,\] (8)

where \lambda is an interaction parameter with electron-phonon and electron-electron coupling components. It can be written as

\[\lambda=(\gamma\gamma_{\rm b}-1)=(m^{*}/m_{\rm b}-1)\,.\] (9)

Here m_{\rm b} is the band-structure electron mass modified by the periodic potential and m^{*} the effective electron mass, increased due to interactions. For the LBNL measurements \gamma =42.1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} from which N(E_{\rm F})=5.76\gamma=242 states Ry^{-1} (HfV2)^{-1}. Using N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F}), from the bare density of states calculation, and N(E_{\rm F}) in Eq. (8) gives \lambda=1.45, which is consistent with HfV2 being a strongly coupled superconductor. [At low temperatures, where \gamma is determined, HfV2 is a mixture of orthorhombic and minority cubic crystallographic phases. Consequently, using the N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F}) calculated for the cubic phase probably results in some inaccuracy for the derived \lambda.] Values of \lambda range from 1.61 to 2.13 using \gamma's evaluated from the LANL measurements on the two single crystals. This variation presumably reflects the effect of strains and/or the amount of untransformed cubic phase. For comparison, \lambda's for the strongly coupled type-I superconductor Pb are 1.48 from resistivity,[31] 1.55 from tunneling,[32] and 1.68 from a theoretical calculation using a local density approximation (LDA).[33] They are similar to \lambda's for HfV2. Table 1 lists \lambda values, calculated from previously reported values of \gamma, and N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F}) from Ref. 30, for polycrystalline samples that range from 1.8 to 2.4. Our polycrystalline sample pc1 has \lambda=2.25 and sample pc2 has \lambda=2.51. These larger values, relative to those of the single crystals, could be associated with different stress fields, and/or ratios of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases below T_{\rm M}, and the stoichiometry.

McMillan[34] introduced an equation that relates T_{\rm c}, \Theta_{\rm D}, and \lambda that is applicable to conventional electron-phonon coupled superconductors when \lambda\leq 1.5,

\[T_{\rm c}=(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45){\rm exp}\{-1.04(1+\lambda)/[\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+ 0.65\lambda)]\},\] (10)

where \mu^{*} is the "renormalized" Coulomb repulsion. Values of \mu^{*} are not well defined; and, it is usually assumed that \mu^{*}\ll 0.2, but there is evidence that it can be larger.[35] In the derivation of Eq. (6) McMillian used the phonon spectrum for Nb, which is characteristic of a number of conventional superconductors. His formula was later modified by Allen and Dynes[36] who replaced the \Theta_{\rm D}/1.45 prefactor with a more correct \omega_{\rm ln}/1.20, where \omega_{\rm ln} is a moment of the phonon frequencies weighted by electron-phonon matrix elements. (Unlike \Theta_{\rm D}, however, a value for \omega_{\rm ln} is not easily obtained.) Using the parameters derived from the LBNL measurements in Eq. (10)--\Theta_{\rm D}=177 K, T_{\rm c}=8.00 K, \lambda=1.45--the renormalized Coulomb repulsion \mu^{*}=0.27. On the other hand, if the Allen and Dynes modification of Eq. (10) is used with \mu^{*}=0.1, \omega_{\rm ln}=72 K. There is a simple relationship[37] between T_{\rm c}, \omega_{\rm ln}, and \lambda_{\rm eff} expressed as

\[T_{\rm c}=0.25\omega_{\rm ln}/[{\rm exp}(2/\lambda_{\rm eff})-1]^{1/2},\] (11)

where \lambda_{\rm eff}\approx\lambda/(1+2.6\mu^{*}) for \lambda> 1. It follows from Eq. (11) that the ratio T_{\rm c}/\omega_{\rm ln} is a measure of the coupling strength. In the present case, for \mu^{*}=0.1, T_{\rm c}/\omega_{\rm ln}=0.11, which is essentially equal to the ratio 0.10 for Pb.[37]

## V Conclusions

In summary, HfV2 is a strongly coupled type-II superconductor whose energy gap and electron-phonon coupling strength are very similar to Pb, a strongly coupled type-I superconductor. The superconductivity is not unconventional as was suggested in some previous work. The \alpha model, a phenomenological modification of the BCS theory that is applicable to strongly coupled superconductors, can be used to fit the LBNL sc1-1 data for B=0 to within experimental accuracy, with a superconducting energy-gap ratio \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=2.1. Similar fits and agreements with data can be made for the LANL measurements.

Parameters characterizing the specific heat of HfV2 for the single crystals are dependent on the number of thermal cycles from ambient temperature through the martensitic transition at T_{\rm M}=117.6 K. Evidence for this is the dependence of T_{\rm c}, \gamma, \gamma_{\rm r}, and C_{\rm lat} on the thermal history; however, there is very little effect on the ratio \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c}. The successive cooling of HfV2 from ambient to low temperatures causes a general increase in \gamma that is coupled to the increases in T_{\rm c}, which approach 9.0 K, perhaps a limiting value.

Structural x-ray determinations showed that the high-temperature cubic phase was not transformed completely to the low-temperature orthorhombic phase at T_{\rm M} and that the amount for sample sc3 (ground into a powder for the measurements) was unchanged in magnitude at \sim9 wt. % when successively cooled from 140 K. Such an incomplete conversion of phases is commonly observed in martensitic transitions, and is usually sample dependent. Because of the incompleteness of the transition, it seems plausible that the dependence of the specific heat on thermal history is a result of changes in the ratio of untransformed cubic-to-orthorhombic phases and/or strains developed at T_{\rm M}. If the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases is relatively reproducible for repeated cycling through T_{\rm M} from ambient temperature the progressive increase of T_{\rm c}--and changes in other parameters--can be rationalized assuming "training" of the sample, which occurs via the elongation of the orthorhombic c axis, thus reducing strain below T_{\rm M}.

  DSC measurements demonstrate that the transition hysteresis is \sim1 K for successive warming/cooling cycles between 90 and 140 K, with no additional effects on T_{\rm M}. Furthermore, they confirm that the martensitic transition to the orthorhombic phase is incomplete.

Both the cubic and orthorhombic phases are superconducting since there is only a small, residual \gamma_{t} that is assumed to be associated with an EDOS for a normal-state phase of HfV_{2}. Since there is a single, relatively sharp, superconducting anomaly the two phases must have nearly identical T_{\rm c}'s and be affected similarly by the thermal history. The relatively large grain size, in the low micron range, and the small coherence length \xi=31 \AA preclude the proximity effect as a mechanism for producing a single anomaly. We speculate that the same T_{\rm c} values observed for each phase arise from the fact that the V tetrahedra leave the phonons associated with the superconductivity unchanged.

In the vortex state \gamma_{\rm v}(B) is linear in B; however, d\,\gamma_{\rm v}(B)/dB and B_{\rm c2}(0), evaluated from an extrapolation to \gamma, depend on the thermal history, and change monotonically with the number of cycles from ambient temperature through T_{\rm M}.

###### Abstract

Specific-heat (_C_) measurements on single crystals of HfV2 were made from 1 to 150 K in magnetic fields (_B_) to 14 T applied along the [110] axis. The type-II superconductor HfV2 has a martensitic transition at _T_M ~ 118 K and becomes superconducting at _T_c ~ 8 to 9 K. Specific heats are thermal-history dependent and _T_c increases following repeated cooling cycles from ambient temperature through _T_M. This progression is probably related to an incomplete structural transition from cubic-to-orthorhombic symmetry at _T_M and the related strains that are produced. Differential scanning calorimetry through _T_M had a hysteresis of ~ 1 K related to cooling and warming cycles between 90 and 140 K with no other effect on the martensitic transition. An x-ray determination of phase contents for one sample was used to establish a ratio (~ 1 : 10) of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases below _T_M. Both phases are superconducting, but only a sharp, anomaly is observed at _T_c, which can be rationalized if both phases have nearly identical _T_c's. From fits to the specific heat above _T_c, a representative derived Debye temperature (\Theta_{\text{D}}), characterizing the low-temperature lattice specific heat, is 177 K. At _T_c the ratio D_C_(_T_c)/_g_T_c = 2.07, with _T_c = 8.00 K and g = 42.1 mJ K^{- 2} mol^{- 1}, is representative of the specific-heat measurements and indicates strong coupling. This ratio is nearly independent of variations in _T_c and C associated with repeated cooling from ambient temperature through _T_M. The conventional superconducting state specific heat can be fitted with the alpha model for strong coupling using an energy gap D(0)/_k_B_T_c = 2.1. It has an associated electron-phonon coupling constant l = 1.45. Both parameters are similar to those for the type-I superconductor Pb. In the normal state the Sommerfeld constant (_g_) depends on the thermal history, with a general increase as _T_c increases. For B > 0 the superconducting anomaly shifts to lower temperatures and the Sommerfeld constant in the vortex state (_g_) is linear in B with values and slopes that depend on the thermal history. Extrapolating _g_(_B_) vs B to g yields upper critical fields (_B_c2) ranging from 29 to 35 T.

## I Introduction

Superconducting transitions are preceded by martensitic transitions in certain compounds with the A15 structure (V3Si,Nb3Sn,V3Al), [1, 2] C15 Laves phase structure (HfV2,ZrV2), [3, 4, 5] and in the B2 cesium chloride structure (VRu). [6] They are all cubic at ambient temperature. Below the martensitic transformation temperature (_T_M) the A15 and B2 materials become tetragonal, while the C15 materials transform into orthorhombic or rhombohedral structures. The C15 Laves phase intermetallic HfV2 transforms from a cubic (C15, AB2 structure) to an orthorhombic (A15, O3_{h}^{3} symmetry structure) at _T_M ~ 118 K and exhibits extraordinary resilience to neutron-radiation damage. [7] At cryogenic temperatures it becomes a type-II superconductor, with _T_c ~ 8 to 9 K, and critical magnetic field, _B_c2 ~ 30 T. In addition to its resistance to neutron-radiation damage, the material softens with decreasing temperature [8] making plastic deformation possible at cryogenic temperatures. [9] Although HfV2 has been studied for over 30 years, the influence of microstructure on the nature of the martensitic transition and controversy over whether the superconductivity is conventional or unconventional continues to make it an interesting material.

Our goals for the research reported in this paper were fourfold: first, to use specific-heat (_C_) measurements to show how the martensitic transition is coupled to and affects the superconductivity and second, to obtain the entropy (D_S_M) and enthalpy (D_H_M) of the phase transformation; third, to identify the nature of the superconductivity; and fourth, to track the evolution of the Sommerfeld constant in the vortex state (_g_c) with magnetic field (_B_). All previous measurements [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] of specific heat used polycrystalline samples, or crystals with high mosaicity, in zero magnetic fields. In this paper we report temperature and magnetic field dependent specific-heat measurements on two single crystals, and on two polycrystalline samples for B = 0.

  

## II Experiment

Single-crystal HfV2 was made using the optical-floating-zone technique. As a first step, Hf (99.9%) and V (99.9%) in the molar ratio 1:2 were melted together in an arc furnace in an Ar atmosphere. Several polycrystalline buttons were prepared in this manner, and then combined in an arc furnace under Ar to form the feed rods for the optical-floating-zone furnace. The growth took place under an ultrahigh-purity Ar flow with the growth rate fixed at 6 mm h-1. The resulting sample was cylindrically shaped, ~2 cm in length, and 1 cm in diameter. X-ray powder diffraction measurements showed sharp Bragg peaks and a single-phase pattern corresponding to the cubic Cu2Mg structure. Laue patterns, taken on disk-shaped samples cut from the cylinder, confirmed its single-crystalline nature. From those patterns the preferred growth axis was deduced as [110]. Laue patterns taken in an area defined by a radius of ~0.2 cm from the center of the sample showed the same orientation, whereas patterns taken closer to the cylinder's edge showed deviations from [110] alignment. It was concluded that the cylindrical sample consisted of large, single-crystal grains with the same orientation confined within a cylindrical volume of radius ~0.2 cm centered on the core of the cylinder.

Measurements of specific heat were made on single crystals (sc1 and sc2) and polycrystalline samples (pc1 and pc2) with _B_|[110]. The measurements at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) were done with a physical properties measurement system (PPMS) and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) using a semiadiabatic, heat-pulse technique. The LBNL sc1 sample had a mass of 0.65 g from which a smaller piece of mass ~0.06 g had been cut previously for the LANL measurements. Combined experiments at LBNL and LANL for these samples covered the temperature (_T_) range 1 to 150 K in magnetic fields to 14 T applied parallel to the [110] crystallographic direction. Cooling rates for sample sc1 are given in Table I. All samples were field cooled prior to the specific-heat measurements. (In a separate experiment, two specific-heat measurements were made in 8 T: first, with 8 T applied after the sample had been cooled to 2 K from 150 K in zero field; second, after cooling to 2 K from 150 K in 8 T. There were no observable differences in the two data sets.)

A third single-crystal (sc3) was used for temperature-dependent x-ray powder diffraction measurements [17] to determine the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases for T < _T_M and the lattice parameters. The temperature range was 20 to 300 K for B = 0.

The martensitic transition was also studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to test for reproducibility and hysteresis in the transition for cooling/warming cycles. Measurements were done with a high-sensitivity calorimeter capable of working under applied magnetic fields to 5 T. [18] The time constant for the calorimeter is <10 s. The sample was a single crystal (sc4) of mass 0.06661 g.

The text, figures, and tables use the identifiers [LBNL sc1-1 or LANL sci-_n_], where i is used to designate the single-crystal sample and n is the number of times it was cooled through _T_M. Similar identifiers [LANL pci-_n_] are used for the polycrystalline samples.

The LBNL sc1-1 first stage of cooling was achieved by establishing contact between the sample and a 77 K heat sink using 2 × 10−4 torr nitrogen gas and mechanical heat switches. The cooling rate was approximately exponential and <1 K min−1 near _T_M. From 77 to 4.2 K the sample was in contact with liquid helium only through mechanical heat switches, and cooled to 4.2 K in ~4 h.

## III Measurements and Results

### Martensitic and superconducting transitions

The martensitic transition at T_{\rm M} has been reported to involve two closely spaced structural modifications from cubic to tetragonal to orthorhombic in the range 100 to 115 K.[19] It is not complete, and at low temperatures there is a mixture of untransformed cubic and predominantly orthorhombic phases whose composition depends on the thermal history.[16, 18, 19, 20]

One paper[20] reported that a polycrystalline sample of HV2 was cooled to a bulk superconducting phase in an untransformed cubic structure with a transition temperature T_{\rm c} = 8.1 K, which led to the conclusion that the superconductivity is not significantly influenced by the crystallographic structure. Since there is a wide variation in T_{\rm c}, depending on the thermal history, it would not be unreasonable to anticipate two anomalies, or at least a significant broadening of a single anomaly, for a mixed-phase sample. However, there is only one, relatively sharp, T_{\rm c} with a transition width \Delta T_{\rm c}\sim 1 K for all samples measured in this research, or for those reported previously by others. This can be rationalized if both phases have essentially the same T_{\rm c} and are influenced in the same way by the thermal history.

### X-ray measurements

X-ray powder diffraction measurements showed that the transition from the cubic to the orthorhombic phase at T_{\rm M} was incomplete, which will create grain boundaries and strains in the lattice that are probably related to the thermal-history dependence of, e.g., T_{\rm c}, \gamma, and \gamma_{\rm v}--Secs. III C and III D--where \gamma and \gamma_{\rm v} are, respectively, the electronic specific heat in the normal and vortex states. (The possibility of fracturing and/or micro-cracking at T_{\rm M} as a contributor to the variability in these parameters was eliminated through elastic-constant measurements that were made on a single crystal following an initial cooling from ambient temperature through T_{\rm M}. Those measurements would not have been possible if the single crystal had cracked or fragmented. Furthermore, it is well known that most martensitic transitions do not cause breakup of the sample.)

The x-ray determinations of the lattice parameters were made on sample sc3--ground into a powder and mixed with GE7031 varnish--from 300 to 20 K (see Table 2) during the first cooling from ambient temperature. (The orthorhombic a axis increased with increasing T while the b and c axes decreased. For the cubic phase the a axis increased with increasing T.) Two additional measurements were made at 140 and 40 K following cycles between those temperatures. The particle length below T_{\rm M} was estimated at 1 to 5 \times 10^{-6} m based on the absence of line broadening. Only the cubic structure was present at 140 K, but below T_{\rm M} both orthorhombic and \sim9 at. % untransformed cubic phases were present--independent of the number of cooling cycles. For a fixed T the a axis for the cubic phase and the a and b axes for the orthorhombic phase were not dependent on the number of cooling cycles; however, the c axis for the orthorhombic phase increased monotonically for each passage through T_{\rm M}. Presumably, different samples, or possibly the same sample following additional cooling cycles from ambient temperature, could have different ratios of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases. This ratio probably also depends on the physical state of the sample--powder, polycrystalline, or single crystal.

### Specific-heat measurements for B = 0

We report first on the PPMS measurements made on single crystal sc1 at LANL. Figure 1 is a plot of C/T vs T from 1.8 to 135 K for B = 0, which was measured following the second cooling of the sample through T_{\rm M} from ambient temperature. This was the only specific-heat measurement made to temperatures above T_{\rm M}. The superconducting (SC)

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} T (K) & a (Å) & V (Å^{3}) & a (Å) & b (Å) & c (Å) & V (Å^{3}) \\ T (K) & [cubic] & [cubic] & [ortho] & [ortho] & [ortho] & [ortho] \\ \hline
20 & 7.329(2) & 393.7(2) & 5.1730(5) & 5.2160(4) & 7.4051(8) & 199.81(4) \\

40 & 7.332(2) & 394.1(2) & 5.1743(5) & 5.2164(4) & 7.

 transition at T_{\rm c} = 8.45 K is in marked contrast to T_{\rm c} = 7.78 K following the first cooling from ambient temperature and measurements of specific heats in B = 0 and 8 T from 2 to 15 K. A total of six specific-heat measurements were made on the LANL sc1 sample following successive cooling through T_{\rm M} from ambient temperature, with an additional four made after repeated cooling from 150 K. The results clearly show that parameters characterizing the specific heat are dependent on the thermal history of the sample.

Figure 2 illustrates how T_{\rm c} for B = 0 depends on thermal cycling. When the sample is successively cooled from ambient temperature T_{\rm c} increases; however, when cooling is from 150 K there is no effect on T_{\rm c}. Other parameters affected by the thermal history are the specific heat of the lattice (C_{\rm lat}), the normal (\gamma) and vortex [\gamma_{\rm c}(B)] states, and, a small residual Sommerfeld constant (\gamma_{\rm r}) that is probably due to an electron density of states (EDOS) in a normal phase mixed with the majority superconducting phase of the sample. (Severe strains in small regions of the sample could completely quench superconductivity and lead to occlusions of normal material whose presence is indicated by \gamma_{\rm r}.) There is a general increase in \gamma (an increase in EDOS) linked to the increase in T_{\rm c}.

Specific heats for sample sc2 were measured at LANL from 1 to 150 K following an initial cooling from ambient temperature and four subsequent cooling cycles from 150 K. These measurements were made to test the effect of repeated cooling from 150 K through T_{\rm M}. To within experimental accuracy all of the data coincided with a T_{\rm c} = 8.1 K.

Polycrystalline sample pc1 was measured for B = 0 from 2 to 150 K. A second polycrystalline sample (pc2) was measured in B = 0 to test the effect on the specific heat after cooling to 2 K from ambient temperature followed by three

Successive cycles produce a monotonic increase in the c axis while the a and b axes are unaffected. For the vertical scales the number of increments and their spacing is the same for each axis.

Figure 2: (Color) A plot of C/T vs T for the smaller piece cut from HV2 single crystal sc1. (In the legend the temperatures given in parentheses are the initial temperatures at the start of the cooling sequence.) The results demonstrate changes in the specific heat in the vicinity of the superconducting transition as a function of the thermal history. There is a progressive increase in T_{c} and C changes for successive cooling sequences started at ambient temperature. For cooling cycles initiated at 150 K, both T_{c} and C are unchanged.

  additional cooling cycles through _T_M from 150 K. This was analogous to the test made with single crystal sc2 and gave similar results.

Various parameters characterizing the specific heat for sc1 and sc2 are collected in Table 1. For comparison, parameters reported previously by others for polycrystalline samples, and those for pc1 and pc2, are also listed in Table 3.

### Thermal-history dependence of _T_c

As sample sc1 was successively cooled from ambient temperature through _T_M to low temperatures, _T_c _increased_ as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1; however, successive cooling cycles from 150 K had no effect. It is tempting to associate these increases in _T_c with a change of the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases below _T_M. However, this would be possible only if repeated cooling from _ambient_ temperature--but not from 140 to 150 K--can reduce the ratio.

However, since both phases are superconducting, with essentially the same specific heat, it is assumed that the mechanism for changes in _T_c must be associated with strains originating from the incomplete structural conversion at _T_M. It seems reasonable to assume that the degree of strain is proportional to the amount of cubic phase below _T_M. (The x-ray measurements showed that only the cubic phase was present at 140 K.) Since subsequent cooling through _T_M from 140 to 150 K did not change either _T_c or the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases, the conclusion is that the strains did not change. It is hypothesized that warming to ambient temperature relieves the strains and "trains" the sample so that each additional cooling cycle through _T_M progressively decreases the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases and/or strains.

The lack of change in _T_c when cooling from 140 to 150 K through _T_M implies that the reduction of strain is an activated process. Strain-driven increases in the orthorhombic c axis with repeated cycling through _T_M (see Fig. 3) might provide a means for their reduction. A proposed mechanism would require the orthorhombic phase to retain a "memory" of the _c_-axis increase following cooling through _T_M, and the "training" would be identified with the monotonic increase in the c axis. However, for this mechanism to operate requires that cooling through _T_M must first be preceded by a return to ambient temperature, which is the activation part of the process. For this scenario, each additional sequence of cooling from ambient temperature through _T_M produces a _decrease_ in strains and an _increase_ in _T_c. (It is assumed, _a priori_, that a decrease in strain will increase _T_c.)

### Specific-heat measurements for B > 0

Three sets of specific-heat measurements were made at LANL on sample sc1 in fields to 14 T after the third, fourth, and fifth cooling sequences. The results for the fifth sequence are shown in Fig. 4 as _C_/_T_ vs T from 1.9 to 12 K for B = 0 to 14 T along the [110] crystal axis; results for the third and fourth sequences are similar.

Only a single cooling through _T_M--the first cooling of the large sc1 sample--was done for the LBNL measurements. Those specific-heat measurements covered the range 1 to 20 K and B = 0, 5, and 9 T and are displayed in Fig. 5. The widths of the transitions, particularly for B > 0, are relatively greater than those of the smaller piece measured at LANL. This could be a consequence of greater strains in the larger piece induced at the martensitic transition. In the case of the in-field measurements, it might also indicate misalignment differences of B with the [110] axis for the two samples. The data for B = 0 are given in Table 1.

### Specific-heat measurements in the vicinity of _T_M

The specific-heat data in the vicinity of _T_M are shown in Fig. 6 for polycrystalline sample pc1 and single-crystal sample sc1, both measured at LANL. _T_M is 117.6 K for the single crystal, as defined by an entropy-conserving construction, with the transition extending over ~10 K, as shown by the enhanced specific heat above and below _T_M. This broadening of the specific-heat anomaly reflects the series of struc

Although martensitic transitions are first order, the shape of the anomaly is lambdalike (unlike any previously reported), which resembles a second-order transition.

In contrast to the single crystal, the martensitic transition at T_{\rm M}=96.3 K for polycrystalline sample pc1 is sharper with a width of \sim1 K and a shape that is suggestive of a first-order transition. Previously reported specific-heat measurements [11, 12, 13, 15, 16] on polycrystalline samples have similar transitions, but with T_{\rm M} ranging from 114-118 K, which is comparable to that for single crystal sc1. Although the

Curves through the data are guides to the eye. The inset shows a plot of B_{c2}(B) vs T_{c}(B) where T_{c}(B) was obtained from entropy conserving constructions for B \leq 14 T. B_{c2}(0) at T_{\rm c}=0 was obtained from the linear extrapolation of \gamma_{\rm v}(B) versus B shown in Fig. 15. The curve represents a quadratic fit to the data.

The solid curves are from polynomial fits to the data, well above and below T_{M}, to establish “baselines” to be used in calculating \Delta H_{M} and \Delta S_{M} for the transitions, which are shown for LANL sc1-2 in the inset.

The sharper peak is probably related to the cubic-to-orthorhombic transition and the long decay is a signature of an incomplete conversion of the cubic phase to the orthorhombic phase.

  polycrystalline sample pc1 has T_{\rm M}\sim 21 K lower in temperature than the single crystals it is superconducting. However, T_{\rm c}= 7.60 K is the lowest reported value and there is a large \gamma_{\rm r}= 11.7 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}. The second polycrystalline sample, pc2, has T_{\rm M}= 100 K (also low), with T_{\rm c}= 9.0 K, and \gamma_{\rm r}= 2.3 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}. Over an extended range above T_{\rm c}, the specific heats for samples pc1 and pc2 are essentially the same to within experimental accuracy.

The homogeneity range of HfV_{2} is only a few percent, and there is a sharp dependence of the composition of a solid on temperature just below the melting point. A possible explanation of the lower T_{\rm M}'s for the polycrystalline samples may be that their stoichiometry is slightly different compared to that of the single crystals.

An analysis of the single-crystal, specific-heat data for sc1 shown in Fig. 6 was made in the vicinity of T_{\rm M} to determine the enthalpy (latent heat) (\Delta H_{\rm M}) and entropy (\Delta S_{\rm M}) changes associated with the transition. A least-squares polynomial fit was made to the data from well above and below the transition region to obtain a "background" specific heat (C_{\rm bkg}). Integration of (C-C_{\rm bkg}) and (C-C_{\rm bkg})/T with respect to T gave \Delta H_{\rm M}=267 J mol^{-1} and \Delta S_{\rm M}=2.28 J K^{-1} mol^{-1}, respectively. Since an unknown amount of untransformed cubic phase is present below T_{\rm M}, actual values would be larger--by \sim9%, perhaps, based on the x-ray determination of the phase content of sample sc3-1.

A similar analysis was made for the pc1 data shown in Fig. 6, which gave \Delta H_{\rm M}=117 J K^{-1} and \Delta S_{\rm M} = 1.22 J K^{-1} mol^{-1}. These values are \sim1/2 those for the single crystal, which implies that either \sim50% of the polycrystalline sample is in the cubic phase below T_{\rm M} or is in a phase where the martensitic transition has been suppressed. Values of \Delta H_{\rm M} and \Delta S_{\rm M} were not determined for sample pc2.

Three additional cooling cycles for pc2 from 150 to 2 K, without return to ambient temperature, had no effect on C. If the assumption is correct that larger T_{\rm c}'s are associated with less untransformed cubic phase and/or lower strain, then pc2-1 with T_{\rm c}=9.0 K has less cubic phase and/or strain for the initial cooling than either of the single crystals or pc1.

### DSC measurements near T_{\rm M}

The reproducibility of the martensitic transition at T_{\rm M} was checked using DSC to measure warming and cooling thermograms between 90 and 140 K in magnetic fields to 5 T. Thermograms record the evolution of the transition temperature. The warming and cooling scan rates were 0.017 K s^{-1}. Since the time constant for the apparatus is <10 s the temperature was retarded by <1 K. Examples of the thermograms for fields of B=0 and 3 T are shown in Fig. 7. For all cases, the curves show a peak followed by a long decay. The existence of such a long decay is characteristic of systems for which the martensitic transition does not proceed to completion on cooling through T_{\rm M} because of the production of internal strains that oppose the transformation. Probably, some of this decay is also related to the conversion of the intermediate tetragonal phase to the low-temperature orthorhombic phase.

The temperature range \Delta T_{\rm M}\sim 9 K over which the transition takes place and the hysteresis \Delta T_{\rm h}\sim 1 K (defined as the difference in temperature of the calorimetric peaks for heating and cooling) are independent of B to within the accuracy of the data. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Since it is unlikely that a martensitic transition would be dependent on magnetic field, in the absence of a simultaneous change of magnetic order, any observed changes must be due to the number of thermal cycles that are associated with the changes of B at 140 K. The lack of a thermal-history dependence of T_{\rm M} from the DSC measurements between 90 and 140 K is similar to that found for both the x-ray and conventional specific-heat measurements that were made following cycling through T_{\rm M} from 140 and 150 K, respectively--see above.

## IV Analysis and discussion

### The lattice and electronic specific heat

Analysis of the specific-heat data in the superconducting region to determine \gamma and C_{\rm lat} utilized least-squares fitting of the data above T_{\rm c}(B) simultaneously for all B to the expression

\[C=\gamma T+\Sigma B_{n}T^{n},\] (1)

where the series B_{n}T^{n}, with coefficients B_{n}, is the harmonic-lattice approximation for C_{\rm lat} with n= 3, 5, 7, 9 and a fitting range of \sim9 to \sim 18 K. The electronic specific-heat component (C_{\rm e}) is obtained by subtracting C_{\rm lat} from C. In the plot of C/T vs T for the LBNL measurements shown in Fig. 5, the curve is the fit \gamma+C_{\rm lat}/T. From the coefficient B_{3} the characteristic Debye temperature (\Theta_{\rm D}) is calculated from the relationship

\[\Theta_{D}= [12\pi^{4}RN_{d}/5B_{3}]^{1/3},\] (2)

where R is the gas constant and N_{\rm a} the number of atoms in a formula unit. For the LBNL sc1-1 measurement \Theta_{\rm D} =177 K. For the six measurements made at LANL, \Theta_{\rm D} ranged from 167 to 176 K. Values of \Theta_{\rm D} were 162 and 167 K for polycrystalline samples pc1 and pc2, respectively. Previously polycrystalline samples^{10,13,14,16} had reported \Theta_{\rm D}'s that varied from 165 to 190 K. These variations in the lattice specific heat are compelling evidence that it is strongly dependent on thermal history and/or the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases. The first time the LANL and LBNL sc1 samples were cooled the rates were very different--see Table I. Since the \Theta_{\rm D}'s are nearly identical, it appears that the _number_ of times cooled from ambient temperature is much more significant than the _cooling rate_ in determining the low-temperature lattice properties.

For T=T_{\rm c} there is the thermodynamic requirement that the entropy of the superconducting state, S_{\rm es}=f(C_{\rm es}/T)dT, be equal to the entropy in the normal state, S_{\rm en}=\gamma T_{\rm c}. (C_{\rm es} is defined as the specific heat of the superconducting state.) Using the parameters obtained from a fit to Eq. (1), where \gamma is an evaluated parameter, will generally not result in equality of the two entropies. To achieve the required balance, a series of fits are made with \gamma constrained, which is system  atically varied in an iterative procedure for successive fits, until S_{\rm es}=S_{\rm em}. Figure 9 is a plot of C_{\rm e}/T vs T for the LBNL sc1-1 data; Fig. 10 is a comparable plot for the LANL sc1-5 sample after the data plotted in Fig. 4 were analyzed in a similar fashion. Before an entropy check can be made, the specific heat must be extrapolated to T=0; this procedure is described below. The amount of entropy involved in the extrapolation is a small fraction of that at T_{\rm c}.

### Nature of the superconductivity: conventional or unconventional

It has been reported [14, 16] that the specific heat below T_{\rm c} follows a T^{3} dependence, which was cited as evidence for an anisotropic, superconducting energy gap that vanishes at nodes (points) on the Fermi surface--a possible unconventional p-wave superconductor. Figure 11 is a plot of C_{\rm e}/T^{3} vs T at B=0 for the LBNL data shown in Fig. 9. Below T_{\rm c} the ratio C_{\rm es}/T^{3} is nearly constant to \sim4.5 K, but for lower temperatures there is a rapid departure from this T^{3} dependence.

Figure 11: (Color) A plot of C_{\rm e}/T^{3} vs T for the B=0 data shown in Fig. 9. This plot demonstrates the T^{3} behavior of C_{\rm es} below T_{c} to \sim4.5 K, which is characteristic of strong coupling. Below this temperature there is a rapid decrease that will be shown to be exponential in Fig.

  (The upturn in C_{\rm es}/T^{3} for T< 1.5 K is a consequence of an EDOS from a small amount of normal material--see the analysis below.) This plot demonstrates conclusively that HIV_{2} is _not_ an unconventional superconductor; the T^{3} behavior, over a limited region, just below T_{\rm c}, is not unusual and is related to strong electron-phonon coupling. (Strong coupling was proposed previously for a polycrystalline sample.[13])

Figure 12 is a plot of ln C_{\rm e} vs 1/T for the LBNL measurements for B=0 that show an exponential dependence of C_{\rm es} below \sim4 K. The BCS theory[21, 22] predicts that at sufficiently low temperatures C_{\rm es}=\,a(0)\,\gamma T_{\rm c}\,\exp[-b(0)T_{\rm c}/T], where the region of validity is usually divided into two sections--2.5 \approx\,T_{\rm c}/T\approx6 and 7 \approx\,T_{\rm c}/T\approx12--each with different values of the parameters a(0) and b(0). At limiting low temperatures C_{\rm es} for B=0 and C_{\rm ev} for the in-field, vortex-state specific heat can be fit by non-linear, least squares to the expression

\[C_{\rm ex}(B)=\gamma(B)T+\alpha(B)\exp[-\beta(B)/T],\] (3)

where \alpha(0)=\,a(0)\,\gamma T_{\rm c}, \beta(0)=\,b(0)T_{\rm c}. C_{\rm ex}=\,C_{\rm es} for B=0 and C_{\rm ev}, the vortex-state specific heat, for B> 0. For the LBNL sample sc1-1, in the range T_{\rm c}/T=2 to 5.6 (see Fig. 13), a(0)=11 mJ K^{-1} mol^{-1} and b(0)=1.71 K, which are comparable to the BCS values 8.5 mJ K^{-1} mol^{-1} and 1.44 K, respectively. Similar values are obtained for the LANL sc1-5 measurements although the fit range is truncated to T_{\rm c}/T=2 to 4 because the measurements are limited to \sim2 K. Equation (3) is also used to extrapolate C_{\rm e}(B) to T=0, albeit without theoretical justification. The results of the fits and extrapolations for the LBNL and LANL data are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively, where the fit parameters are tabulated. Gap parameters \beta(B) and prefactors \alpha(B) both decrease with increasing B. For both sets of measurements the entropies above T_{\rm c} agree for all B to within experimental accuracy as required by the third law of thermodynamics. The entropy checks for the LBNL data for sample sc1-1 are given in Fig. 9.

Sommerfeld constant \gamma vs B and the upper (B_{\rm c2}) and lower (B_{\rm c1}) critical fields

The simplest explanation for a residual linear in T term for B=0 is the presence of an EDOS from normal material, which is characterized by a Sommerfeld constant \gamma_{\rm r}. All \gamma_{\rm r}'s for the single-crystal measurements on sc1 and sc2 were small (varying from 0 to 2.4 mJ K^{-1} mol^{-1}--see Table 1). However, for the polycrystalline sample pc1 \gamma_{\rm r} = 11.7 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} implying that \sim21% of the sample remained in the normal state. Polycrystalline sample pc2 had \gamma_{\rm r}=2.3 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}.

The Sommerfeld constants for B> 0, obtained from the fits using Eq. (3), are composites of \gamma_{\rm r}= \gamma(0) from normal

Figure 14: (Color) A plot of C_{\rm es}/T vs T for the specific-heat data shown is in Fig. 10, which is similar to that of Fig. 13. The fitting expression and parameters are given in the figure. Extrapolations are over longer ranges of temperature than in Fig. 13 because the PPMS cryostat used for the measurements has a limiting lower temperature of \sim2 K.

Figure 12: (Color) A plot of ln[C_{\rm c}] vs 1/T shows the exponential dependence of C_{\rm es} below \sim4.5 K, where the specific-heat data are those for B=0 shown in Fig. 9. The departure of the data from the fit line below \sim1.4 K is the result of a lowered precision of C_{\rm es} as T approaches zero.

Figure 13: (Color) A plot of C_{\rm es}/T vs T for B=0, 5, and 9 T, which illustrates the results of an exponential fit and extrapolation of the electronic specific-heat data shown in Fig. 9. The fitting expression and parameters are given in the figure.

  material and \gamma_{\rm v}^{\prime}(B) from the vortex state. They are corrected to values corresponding to a fully superconducting sample using the relationship \gamma_{\rm v}(B) = [\gamma_{\rm v}^{\prime}(B) - \gamma_{\rm v}\rbrack/(1 - \gamma_{\rm v}/\gamma) and are plotted in Figs. 15 as \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B. For each cooling sequence through T_{\rm M} from ambient temperature, a plot of \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B is linear, to within experimental accuracy, but with different slopes [d\gamma_{\rm v}(B)/dB] and corresponding values of \gamma--see Table 1 and Fig. 15. As the number of times cooled from ambient temperature through T_{\rm M}_increases_, d\gamma_{\rm v}(B)/dB_decreases_.

If the linear relationship holds to the normal state \gamma, the extrapolated upper critical fields (B_{\rm c2}) range from 28.6 to 33.6 to 35.4 T for the cooling sequences LBNL sc1-1 and LANL sc1-3,5, respectively. [Because of a malfunction of the PPMS on the fourth cooling (sc1-4), no B = 0 specific-heat measurements were made, and \gamma_{\rm v} was not determined; however, a plot of \gamma_{\rm v}^{\prime}(B) vs B--not shown in Fig. 15--was linear.] For a polycrystalline sample of Hf0.4Zr0.6V2, with T_{\rm c}= 10.1 K, B_{\rm c2} was reported [23] to be 28 T. ZrV2 has the same crystal structure as HfV2 and both undergo martensitic transitions. At 0.005 T an M vs B measurement, where M is the magnetic moment, gave a T_{\rm c} of 7.7 K for the first cooling through T_{\rm M}. This is comparable to T_{\rm c} = 7.78 K for the first cooling of HfV2. Consequently, the B_{\rm c2}(0) = 28 T for Hf0.4Zr0.6V2 is probably similar to that for HfV2, which provides supporting evidence that \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B is linear to \gamma.

In the vortex state for a type-II superconductor, for B near the lower critical field (B_{\rm c1}), the theory [24] predicts that \gamma_{\rm v}(B) versus B will be strongly nonlinear (downward curvature) because of vortex-vortex interactions, and will approach linearity only when B \ggB_{\rm c1}. If vortex-vortex interactions are absent, or negligible, \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B is linear. [24]

The magnetic susceptibility of a HfV2 single crystal was measured as a function of B following zero-field cooling to 1.9 K. A plot of M vs B was linear to \sim0.02 T with a minimum at 0.046 T. B_{\rm c1} is estimated to be \sim0.02 T, but see Sec. IV D for another estimate using the thermodynamic critical field (B_{\rm c}). (A more precise value of B_{\rm c1} is not possible from the M vs H measurements since the sample is a single crystal of approximately cubic dimension that is not uniformly magnetized, which would cause inhomogeneous flux penetration and exclusion. Another complication is hysteresis produced by pinning.) However, since the lowest in-field measurement of specific heat for sample sc1-3 was at 0.5 T--more than an order of magnitude greater than the minimum in M vs B at 0.046 T--a departure from linearity for \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B would not be expected, nor was one observed.

### Thermodynamic critical field (B_{\rm c}) and related parameters

The thermodynamic critical field is defined for B = 0 as

\[(V/8\,\pi)B_{\rm c}(T)^{2} = G_{\rm es}(T) - G_{\rm en}(T) = - \int_{0}^{T}[S_{\rm es}(T) - \gamma T]dT,\]

where V is the molar volume and G the Gibbs free energy for the superconducting, G_{\rm es}, and normal, G_{\rm en}, states, respectively. At T_{\rm c} the free energies of the superconducting and normal states are equal and by setting G_{\rm es}(T_{\rm c}) - G_{\rm en}(T_{\rm c}) = 0 the integration constant is determined. The unit cell contains four HfV2 molecules and its volume is given as a function of temperature in Table 2, from which V = 30.1 cm^{3} mol^{-1}. G_{\rm en}(T) - G_{\rm en}(T) was calculated from the specific-heat data for LBNL sc1-1 (T_{\rm c}=8.00 K and \gamma=42.1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}). At T =0, B_{\rm c}(0) = 0.245 T and the curve of B_{\rm c}(T) versus T can be fit to within 0.3% to the two-fluid model, parabolic expression

\[B_{\rm c}(T) = B_{\rm c}(0)[1 - (T/T_{\rm c})^{2}] = 0.245[1 - (T/8.00)^{2}].\]

Equation (5) is not a good representation for BCS superconductors, but for very strong coupling, as in the present case, C_{\rm es} \propto T^{3} near T_{\rm c} (see Fig. 11) and the fit is improved. Unlike B_{\rm c2}(T) vs T and B_{\rm c1}(T) vs T, there is no change in properties when the B_{\rm c}(T) boundary is crossed. However, it is related to B_{\rm c1} and B_{\rm c2} by characteristic superconducting parameters that are associated with the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity [25]

\[B_{\rm c2} = (2)^{1/2}\kappa B_{\rm c} = \Phi_{0}/2\,\pi\xi^{2} = 4\,\pi\lambda_{p}^{2}B_{\rm c}^{2}/\Phi_{0}\]

and

\[B_{\rm c1} \approx [ \ln\kappa/(2)^{1/2}\kappa]B_{\rm c},\]

where \xi is the coherence length, \lambda_{\rm p} the penetration depth, \kappa = \lambda_{\rm p}/\xi (\kappa < 1 for type-I and \kappa > 1 for type-II superconductors), and \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum (2.07\times 10^{-11} T cm^{2}).

Using B_{\rm c2}(0) = 22.6 T from the extrapolation of \gamma_{\rm v}(B) vs B for LBNL sc1-1 and B_{\rm c}(0) = 0.245 T gave: \kappa(0) = 82, \xi(0) = 34 A, \lambda_{\rm p}(0) = 2800 A, and B_{\rm c1}(0) = 0.009 T. A similar fit to the LANL sc1-5 data (T_{\rm c} = 8.60 K and \gamma = 45.9 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}) using the extrapolated B_{\rm c2}(0) = 35.4 T gave: B_{\rm c}(0) = 0.279 T, \kappa(0) = 90, \xi(0) = 31 A, \lambda_{\rm p}(0) = 2740 A, and B_{\rm c1}(0) = 0.01 T. The fit of B_{\rm c}(T) vs T for LANL sc1-5 to Eq. (5) was similar to that of LBNL sc1-1: B_{\rm c}(T) = 0.280[1 -(7/8.61)^{2}].

The lower critical field, B_{\rm c1}(0), calculated from Eq. (7) is less well determined than the other parameters. Nevertheless, it is not inconsistent with B_{\rm c1}(0) < 0.02 T estimated from the M vs B measurements at 1.9 K.

The coherence length \xi, is much smaller than the grain size of 1 to 5 microns (10 000 to 50 000 A) estimated from the x-ray measurements below T_{M} . Consequently, the proximity effect can not be invoked to explain the presence of a single, sharp anomaly at T_{\rm c} for a mixture of cubic and orthorhombic phases.

### The discontinuity in specific heat at T_{\rm c}

Figure 16 is a plot of C_{\rm c}/T vs T for the LBNL measurements on sc1 made for B = 0, where the transition to the superconducting state has a width \Delta T_{\rm c}\sim 1 K. The C_{\rm es}/T data below T_{\rm c} are corrected and normalized to that for a fully superconducting sample by subtracting \gamma_{\rm r} =0.5 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} and dividing by the factor (1 - \gamma_{\rm r}/\gamma). An entropy-conserving construction defines T_{\rm c}=8.00 K and the size of the discontinuity \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/T_{\rm c}= 87.1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} for an ideal superconducting transition. The scaled discontinuity

 at T_{\rm c}, \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} = 2.07, is indicative of strong electron-phonon coupling, which is in accord with the T^{3} dependence near T_{\rm c} shown in Fig. 11. A BCS curve, where \Delta(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} = 1.43, is shown for comparison. Although both T_{\rm c} and \gamma are dependent on the cooling sequence for sample sc1 (they range from 7.8 to 9.0 K and 42.1 to 53.8 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1}, respectively), the values of \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} have a smaller variation--1.95 to 2.10--to within approximately the accuracy of the various measurements--see Table 1. Samples sc2, pc1, and pc2 also have \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} values of 1.99, 1.95, and 1.93, respectively. If different samples have different ratios of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases below T_{\rm M}, this observation supports the argument that superconductivity in HfV_{2} is essentially independent of the crystallographic phase.[16, 20] [For other polycrystalline samples, reported previously,[10, 13, 14, 15, 16]\Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} ranges from 1.7 to 2.0.] For comparison Pb, which is a strongly coupled type-I superconductor,[26] has T_{\rm c} = 7.19 K and \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c}=2.65.

### F. Fit of C_{\rm es} to the \alpha model for B=0

A semiempirical modification of the BCS formalism, the \alpha model,[27] was developed to enable a quantitative fit of the specific heat of strongly coupled, single-gap superconductors. (This interpretation was recently extended to two-gap superconductors[28] and was successfully applied to MgB_{2}.) In the \alpha model's phenomenological modification of the BCS theory the superconducting energy-gap ratio, \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{\rm c} (k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant), is used as a fitting variable in place of the lower-bound BCS value 1.764; however, the temperature dependence of the gap is assumed to be the same

Figure 16: (Color) A plot of C_{\rm c}/T vs T for B=0, for the larger single-crystal piece (sc1) of HfV_{2} measured at LBNL, with an entropy-conserving construction that defines T_{\rm c}. The data have been corrected, as discussed in the text, for the EDOS of the small amount of assumed normal material. The BCS specific-heat curve is shown for comparison. The increased height of the anomaly, compared to that for a BCS superconductor, indicates strong electron-phonon coupling.

Figure 17: (Color) This plot illustrates the fit of the LBNL sc1-1 C_{\rm es} data shown in Fig. 16 to the \alpha model, a phenomenological modification of the BCS theory that is applicable to strongly coupled superconductors. The fit is excellent and the superconducting energy-gap ratio of 2.1 is nearly identical to the 2.2 energy-gap ratio for the type-1 superconductor Pb. The BCS curve is included for comparison.

Figure 15: (Color) Plots of \gamma_{\rm p}(B) vs B determined for B[[110] axis. From bottom-to-top the data are from LBNL sc1-1, LANL sc1-3, and LANL sc1-5. While \gamma_{\rm p} is linear in B, \gamma_{\rm p}(B), and d\gamma_{\rm p}(B)/dB are dependent on the thermal history. The upper critical field (B_{c2}) is evaluated assuming the linear relationship holds to \gamma. The differences in \gamma and B_{c2} are probably attributable to different ratios of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases and/or variations of the stress fields developed at the martensitic transition.

  as that of the BCS theory. Figure 17 shows the \alpha-model fit to the LBNL specific-heat data for sc1. The fit uses a gap ratio \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{\rm c}=2.1, and it agrees well with the normalized C_{\rm ss} data. This energy gap ratio is nearly identical to the 2.2 for Pb.[29] For comparison, the BCS curve is also shown in Fig. 17. The LANL data for sc1, sc2, pc1, and pc2 can also be fit by the \alpha model with very similar results.

### Electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda

Band-structure calculations have been reported[30] for HV2 in the cubic C15 Lawes phase that give a bare density of states at the Fermi level N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F})=197.9 states Ry^{-1} (primitive unit cell)^{-1}. Since there are two HV2 formula units in a primitive unit cell, N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F})=99.0 states Ry^{-1} (HfV2)^{-1}. The relationships between N(E_{\rm F}), and the bare density of states \gamma_{b} are given by

\[N(E_{\rm F})=(1+\lambda)N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F})=(3/\pi^{2}k_{B})(1+\lambda)\gamma _{\rm b}=(3/\pi^{2}k_{\rm B})\gamma,\] (8)

where \lambda is an interaction parameter with electron-phonon and electron-electron coupling components. It can be written as

\[\lambda=(\gamma\gamma_{\rm b}-1)=(m^{*}/m_{\rm b}-1)\,.\] (9)

Here m_{\rm b} is the band-structure electron mass modified by the periodic potential and m^{*} the effective electron mass, increased due to interactions. For the LBNL measurements \gamma =42.1 mJ K^{-2} mol^{-1} from which N(E_{\rm F})=5.76\gamma=242 states Ry^{-1} (HfV2)^{-1}. Using N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F}), from the bare density of states calculation, and N(E_{\rm F}) in Eq. (8) gives \lambda=1.45, which is consistent with HfV2 being a strongly coupled superconductor. [At low temperatures, where \gamma is determined, HfV2 is a mixture of orthorhombic and minority cubic crystallographic phases. Consequently, using the N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F}) calculated for the cubic phase probably results in some inaccuracy for the derived \lambda.] Values of \lambda range from 1.61 to 2.13 using \gamma's evaluated from the LANL measurements on the two single crystals. This variation presumably reflects the effect of strains and/or the amount of untransformed cubic phase. For comparison, \lambda's for the strongly coupled type-I superconductor Pb are 1.48 from resistivity,[31] 1.55 from tunneling,[32] and 1.68 from a theoretical calculation using a local density approximation (LDA).[33] They are similar to \lambda's for HfV2. Table 1 lists \lambda values, calculated from previously reported values of \gamma, and N_{\rm b}(E_{\rm F}) from Ref. 30, for polycrystalline samples that range from 1.8 to 2.4. Our polycrystalline sample pc1 has \lambda=2.25 and sample pc2 has \lambda=2.51. These larger values, relative to those of the single crystals, could be associated with different stress fields, and/or ratios of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases below T_{\rm M}, and the stoichiometry.

McMillan[34] introduced an equation that relates T_{\rm c}, \Theta_{\rm D}, and \lambda that is applicable to conventional electron-phonon coupled superconductors when \lambda\leq 1.5,

\[T_{\rm c}=(\Theta_{\rm D}/1.45){\rm exp}\{-1.04(1+\lambda)/[\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+ 0.65\lambda)]\},\] (10)

where \mu^{*} is the "renormalized" Coulomb repulsion. Values of \mu^{*} are not well defined; and, it is usually assumed that \mu^{*}\ll 0.2, but there is evidence that it can be larger.[35] In the derivation of Eq. (6) McMillian used the phonon spectrum for Nb, which is characteristic of a number of conventional superconductors. His formula was later modified by Allen and Dynes[36] who replaced the \Theta_{\rm D}/1.45 prefactor with a more correct \omega_{\rm ln}/1.20, where \omega_{\rm ln} is a moment of the phonon frequencies weighted by electron-phonon matrix elements. (Unlike \Theta_{\rm D}, however, a value for \omega_{\rm ln} is not easily obtained.) Using the parameters derived from the LBNL measurements in Eq. (10)--\Theta_{\rm D}=177 K, T_{\rm c}=8.00 K, \lambda=1.45--the renormalized Coulomb repulsion \mu^{*}=0.27. On the other hand, if the Allen and Dynes modification of Eq. (10) is used with \mu^{*}=0.1, \omega_{\rm ln}=72 K. There is a simple relationship[37] between T_{\rm c}, \omega_{\rm ln}, and \lambda_{\rm eff} expressed as

\[T_{\rm c}=0.25\omega_{\rm ln}/[{\rm exp}(2/\lambda_{\rm eff})-1]^{1/2},\] (11)

where \lambda_{\rm eff}\approx\lambda/(1+2.6\mu^{*}) for \lambda> 1. It follows from Eq. (11) that the ratio T_{\rm c}/\omega_{\rm ln} is a measure of the coupling strength. In the present case, for \mu^{*}=0.1, T_{\rm c}/\omega_{\rm ln}=0.11, which is essentially equal to the ratio 0.10 for Pb.[37]

## V Conclusions

In summary, HfV2 is a strongly coupled type-II superconductor whose energy gap and electron-phonon coupling strength are very similar to Pb, a strongly coupled type-I superconductor. The superconductivity is not unconventional as was suggested in some previous work. The \alpha model, a phenomenological modification of the BCS theory that is applicable to strongly coupled superconductors, can be used to fit the LBNL sc1-1 data for B=0 to within experimental accuracy, with a superconducting energy-gap ratio \Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=2.1. Similar fits and agreements with data can be made for the LANL measurements.

Parameters characterizing the specific heat of HfV2 for the single crystals are dependent on the number of thermal cycles from ambient temperature through the martensitic transition at T_{\rm M}=117.6 K. Evidence for this is the dependence of T_{\rm c}, \gamma, \gamma_{\rm r}, and C_{\rm lat} on the thermal history; however, there is very little effect on the ratio \Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c}. The successive cooling of HfV2 from ambient to low temperatures causes a general increase in \gamma that is coupled to the increases in T_{\rm c}, which approach 9.0 K, perhaps a limiting value.

Structural x-ray determinations showed that the high-temperature cubic phase was not transformed completely to the low-temperature orthorhombic phase at T_{\rm M} and that the amount for sample sc3 (ground into a powder for the measurements) was unchanged in magnitude at \sim9 wt. % when successively cooled from 140 K. Such an incomplete conversion of phases is commonly observed in martensitic transitions, and is usually sample dependent. Because of the incompleteness of the transition, it seems plausible that the dependence of the specific heat on thermal history is a result of changes in the ratio of untransformed cubic-to-orthorhombic phases and/or strains developed at T_{\rm M}. If the ratio of cubic-to-orthorhombic phases is relatively reproducible for repeated cycling through T_{\rm M} from ambient temperature the progressive increase of T_{\rm c}--and changes in other parameters--can be rationalized assuming "training" of the sample, which occurs via the elongation of the orthorhombic c axis, thus reducing strain below T_{\rm M}.

  DSC measurements demonstrate that the transition hysteresis is \sim1 K for successive warming/cooling cycles between 90 and 140 K, with no additional effects on T_{\rm M}. Furthermore, they confirm that the martensitic transition to the orthorhombic phase is incomplete.

Both the cubic and orthorhombic phases are superconducting since there is only a small, residual \gamma_{t} that is assumed to be associated with an EDOS for a normal-state phase of HfV_{2}. Since there is a single, relatively sharp, superconducting anomaly the two phases must have nearly identical T_{\rm c}'s and be affected similarly by the thermal history. The relatively large grain size, in the low micron range, and the small coherence length \xi=31 \AA preclude the proximity effect as a mechanism for producing a single anomaly. We speculate that the same T_{\rm c} values observed for each phase arise from the fact that the V tetrahedra leave the phonons associated with the superconductivity unchanged.

In the vortex state \gamma_{\rm v}(B) is linear in B; however, d\,\gamma_{\rm v}(B)/dB and B_{\rm c2}(0), evaluated from an extrapolation to \gamma, depend on the thermal history, and change monotonically with the number of cycles from ambient temperature through T_{\rm M}.
