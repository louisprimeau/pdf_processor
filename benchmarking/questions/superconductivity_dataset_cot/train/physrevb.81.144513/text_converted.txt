###### Abstract

The roles of Se deficiency and Fe atoms, for the superconductivity of
FeSe, have been, respectively, investigated in FeSe_(1 − δ) and
(Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − δ) by our NMR experiments. The data, for
nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T₁), show that the spin
fluctuations are weakened at a larger δ, and are correlated with the
superconductivity in FeSe. The superconducting volume fraction,
estimated by our ac susceptibility experiments, is found to vary
inversely with δ. Our findings suggest that the Se-deficient FeSe has an
inhomogeneous phase, where the superconductivity is associated with the
regions having few or no Se vacancies. As for
(Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − δ)$T_{\rm c}$ is rapidly suppressed by Cu
doping and vanishes around x=0.03. The ⁷⁷Se and the ⁶³Cu NMR linewidths
suggest that a local moment is induced at the Fe sites and not at the Cu
sites. However, 1/T₁ shows no obvious change with the Cu doping. We
suspect that other effects, such as disorder or change in the density of
states, have more influence on $T_{\rm c}$ suppression since a
metal-insulator transition, induced by Cu substitution, occurs in the
resistivity measurements.

Among the discovered iron-based superconductors, FeSe_(1 − δ) was a
binary compound to be found.[1] Though its superconducting temperature,
$T_{\rm c}$∼ 8 K, is not as high as those in the class of iron-arsenic
superconductors, FeSe_(1 − δ) has quickly drawn considerable attention,
due to its structural simplicity and easier material handling. Recent
high-pressure experiments have even raised its $T_{\rm c}$ up to 36.7 K,
which is comparable to the FeAs-based superconductors.[2] This has made
FeSe a potential paradigm for investigating the mechanism of
superconductivity in the Fe-based superconductors. Indeed, FeSe has been
found to share a number of features with the FeAs-based superconductors,
including layered structures, electronic states, and lattice
instability.[3, 4, 5] However, still unclear is whether or not FeSe is
similar to the iron arsenides, with regard to spin-density-wave
instability or magnetic order.[2, 6] Recent high-pressure NMR
experiments, on the other hand, have demonstrated strong spin
correlation with the superconductivity in FeSe, as also found in other
iron arsenides.[7, 8] Further investigation must determine whether or
not the spin-fluctuation-driven picture, of the Cooper-pairing
mechanism, is applicable to the Fe-based superconductors. Here, we
report our NMR studies on the Se-deficient and Cu-substituted FeSe.

Iron selenide has complex structural phases, as summarized in the
original literature where the superconductivity was reported in the
Se-deficient tetragonal β-FeSe, i.e., FeSe_(0.82) and FeSe_(0.88).[1] A
similar finding soon followed, for a composition of FeSe_(0.92),[9]
However, McQueen _et al._ have recently claimed that the
superconductivity actually exists only in the nearly stoichiometric FeSe
and a small Se deficiency (δ=0.03) is enough to destroy the Cooper
pairing.[10] Though they attributed this discrepancy to the oxygen
contamination in those Se-deficient samples, it is intriguing to ask why
any oxygen contamination, in FeSe_(0.88) and FeSe_(0.92), would produce
a similar $T_{\rm c}$ as FeSe_(0.99). Clarifying the role of Se
deficiency, in FeSe, is crucial to any theoretical treatments of the
pairing mechanism because it determines whether or not it is essential
to introduce charge carriers in the two-dimensional (2D) FeSe layers, as
compared to the cuprate superconductors.

The role of the Fe²⁺ spin is another interesting issue, which has
recently been investigated by chemically substituting Fe for Cu, i.e.,
(Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − δ)[11, 12] The superconductivity is rapidly
suppressed by the Cu doping and is followed by a metal-insulator
transition. Cu²⁺ and Fe²⁺ have the same valence electrons but posses
different spins and atomic radii. This chemical substitution is
generally expected to alter the lattice and electronic structures, to
introduce disorder and modify spin correlation. However, which one most
dominates needs clarification.

We have conducted experiments for ⁷⁷Se NMR spectrum and nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T₁), on Se-deficient FeSe_(0.88) and
Cu-doped (Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − δ) to investigate the role of Se
deficiency and magnetic correlation in FeSe. Our findings suggest that
spin fluctuations are closely related to the superconductivity in FeSe,
as previously reported by Imai _et al.[7]_ Our 1/T₁ and superconducting
volume fraction analysis indicate that the Se-deficient FeSe has an
inhomogeneous electronic state, where the pairing occurs only in the
regions having few or no Se vacancy, expanding upon similar results from
previously reported NMR data. This is supported by the decrease in spin
fluctuation and superconducting volume fraction at larger δ. As for
(Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − δ) we find that the NMR linewidth increases
drastically upon Cu doping and then saturates. Whether or not this
Cu-induced disorder is correlated with the rapid suppression of
$T_{\rm c}$ needs further investigation. Interestingly, the 1/T₁ is
nearly unchanged upon Cu doping. We suspect that the electronic band
structure is altered more significantly than the spin dynamics because a
metal-insulator transition was shown in the resistivity measurements.[1]

Polycrystalline samples of the Se-deficient FeSe_(0.88) and the
Cu-substituted (Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − δ) with (x, δ) = (0, 0.12),
(0.01, 0.15), (0.02, 0.12), (0.03, 0.12), and (0.04, 0.12) were used in
our NMR and ac magnetic-susceptibility experiments. Sample preparation
was similar to that of (Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(0.85) in Ref. [11]. Figure
1 gives the powder x-ray diffraction patterns of these samples. Rietveld
refinement was analyzed by using GSAS software, to confirm the sample
stoichiometry and quality. Detailed structural analysis shows similar
features as for (Fe1-Cu3)Se0.85 in Ref. 11. Figure 2 shows the
resistivity (normalized to 300 K) of different Cu contents. As in
(Fe1-xCu3)Se0.85 and (Fe1-01-Cu3)Se, a metal-insulator transition is
also observed in our (Fe1-xCu3)Se0.88 samples.[11, 12]

To our knowledge, there are only three NMR papers, to date, reporting on
superconductivity in FeSe1-_b_ Imai _et al._ measured the nearly
stoichiometric FeSe0.99 and FeSe0.97, with the samples claimed to be
free of oxygen contamination.[7] Kotegawa _et al._[13] and Masaki _et
al._[8] studied the Se-deficient FeSe0.92 but did not specify whether or
not there was any oxygen contamination. In order to resolve the
discrepancy, regarding the stoichiometry of the superconductivity in
FeSe, the following discussions compare our FeSe0.88 data, with the data
reproduced from the previous literature. Standard Hahn-echo pulse
sequences and saturation pulses were, respectively, employed throughout
our 77Se NMR spectra and 1/_T_1 experiments at 75 kG.

Figure 3 shows the 77Se NMR spectra of FeSe1-_b_ at 10 K. The linewidth
increases with the Se deficiency, as expected because NMR linewidth
generally reflects the amount of lattice disorder in the sample. This
indirectly confirms the correct stoichiometry of these samples. Similar
_T_e = 8 K, observed in the disordered FeSe0.88 and ordered FeSe0.99,
suggests that the Cooper pairing is not vulnerable to the lattice
disorder induced by the Se vacancy. We notice that the frequency shift
(_K_) does not vary much with d (Fig. 3, inset), which means that the
local spin susceptibility _kh_ does not change much either because K
_kh_. These results differ from those, in the report on bulk
susceptibilities, by Williams _et al._, in which bulk susceptibility
increases significantly with d, due to the impurity phases from excess
Fe or iron oxides. If these magnetic impurities were bonded to the FeSe
samples, magnetic broadening of the linewidth would also be seen at low
temperature. The linewidth for our FeSe0.88 is nearly temperature
independent, from 70 K down to _T_c (not shown), as was the case for
FeSe0.92 in Ref. 13. Therefore, our NMR frequency shift and linewidth
data suggest that any impurity phases would not enter the FeSe1-_b_
stoichiometry but we cannot rule out the possibility of oxygen
contamination in FeSe1-_b_ as McQueen _et al._[10] pointed out, for
FeSe1-_b_Oy. We will leave this issue to a later discussion.

Figure 4 displays a typical nuclear spin-lattice relaxation curve
[_M_(_t_): nuclear magnetization as a function of time] for FeSe0.88 at
16 K. Stretched exponential behavior [ϵ^(−(t/T₁)^(n))] is observed, in
contrast to the single exponential in FeSe0.99 and FeSe0.97. This means
that T1 is distributed in FeSe0.88, due to Se-vacancy-induced disorder.
We note that the single exponential, in the nearly stoichiometric FeSe
polycrystal samples, implies a nearly isotropic T1, although it
possesses a 2D layered structure. A stretched exponential, caused by
anisotropic T1, is then ruled out. The inset shows the stretched
exponent (_a_) obtained from a stretched exponential curve fitting. This
temperature-dependent exponent implies that different Se sites have
different temperature-dependent 1/_T_1. Similar behavior was also
reported in FeSe0.92.[13]

The relaxation rate from the stretched fit is plotted in Fig. 5. The
Korringa-type behavior (_T_1_T_=const), for temperatures between _T_c
and 50 K, in FeSe0.88 and FeSe0.92, is actually misleading because both
1/_T_1 values are directly from the stretched exponential fit. These
stretched data cannot reflect the true average behavior for 1/(_T_1_T_)
since the stretched exponent is known to be temperature dependent.
Masaki _et al._ have fit their FeSe0.92 relaxation curves, using a

two-T₁ function, and found that the short T₁ component displays an
enhanced 1/T₁ that is similar to FeSe_(0.99).[8] The upward 1/(T₁T),
just above T_(c), has been considered as evidence for the connection of
spin fluctuations to superconductivity in FeSe.[7] In order to catch the
intrinsic feature from the distributed T₁, we calculated the average
1/T₁, directly from the initial slope of the relaxation curve,[14]
instead of the two-T₁ fit. Figure 6 (filled circles) gives the average
1/(T₁T) data for our FeSe_(0.88). Indeed, similar uprising behavior, at
low temperature, is seen in our sample, in contrast to the flat behavior
in the nonsuperconducting FeSe_(0.97). Note that the drop of 1/(T₁T)
below T_(c), expected from the opening of the superconducting gap, is
smeared out due to the broad 1/T₁ distribution.

We can see that the size of the spin fluctuations seems to decrease with
δ, for the superconducting samples, by looking at the 1/(T₁T) value just
above T_(c) (Fig. 5). If the magnetic fluctuations are strongly linked
to the Cooper pairing in FeSe, why do FeSe_(0.99), FeSe_(0.92), and
FeSe_(0.88) show similar onset T_(c)? The superconducting volume
fraction estimated from our ac susceptibility experiment may provide a
clue. Figure 7 (open circles) shows our dynamical
magnetic-susceptibility data for FeSe_(0.88). It was measured by using
the LC resonant circuit originally for NMR experiments.[7] This method
utilizes the resonance frequency ω (∼$1/\sqrt{LC}$) of the LC circuit
which changes with the inductance, which in turn depends on the sample
susceptibility χ. That is, L=L₀[1 + 4πχ(T)], L₀: inductance of the NMR
coil. The rising of the frequency-shift ratio [defined as ω(T)/ω(15)−1]
in Fig. 7 represents the superconducting transition because ω increases
as it enters the superconducting state, χ<0. The size of the
frequency-shift ratio gives a rough estimate of the superconducting
volume fraction.

We found that FeSe_(0.88) has a superconducting volume fraction
significantly smaller than FeSe_(0.99) since FeSe_(0.88) has a smaller
frequency-shift ratio. The dc bulk susceptibilities, reported in Ref.
[12], show the similar result of a weaker superconducting diamagnetic
response in FeSe_(0.82), if the background signal from impurities is
subtracted. Note that the pressure experiment on FeSe_(0.99) shows that
T_(c) and superconducting volume fraction vary simultaneously with
pressure,[7] unlike in the Se-deficient case, where only superconducting
volume fraction varies with Se deficiency. We also did the two-T₁
analysis for our FeSe_(0.88) and found that the volume fraction, for the
short T₁ component, is about 50

Combining the reduced superconducting volume fraction in the
Se-deficient FeSe with the findings from the previous discussions, i.e.,
the different temperature-dependent 1/T₁ at different Se sites and the
reduced spin fluctuations at a larger δ, we infer that the Se-deficient
FeSe has an inhomogeneous phase, where the superconductivity comes from
regions with few or no Se vacancies. The Se-vacancy-free region has much
stronger magnetic fluctuations than the Se-vacant region. When greater
vacancy is introduced in FeSe, both the overall spin fluctuations and
superconducting volume fraction decrease. However, this picture cannot
explain why the superconductivity disappears in FeSe_(0.97).[10] Is this
really due to the oxygen contamination in those Se-deficient samples so
that the superconductivity is actually from FeSe_(1 − δ)O_(y), instead
of FeSe_(1 − δ)? An oxygen-free FeSe_(0.82) has been reported by
Williams _et al._, with magnetic susceptibility clearly showing a
superconducting diamagnetic response, if the background signal from
impurities is subtracted.[12] Therefore, we think it unlikely that
occurrence of any oxygen contamination is the cause. While preparing
this paper, we noticed that a different result was recently reported,
where the superconductivity was claimed to exist in a narrow range of
δ=0.03, i.e., FeSe_(0.974 ± 0.005).[15] These recent experiments,
together with our own, indicate that the superconductivity emerges from
the nearly stoichiometric FeSe.

Figure 8(a) shows the ⁷⁷Se NMR spectra in the normal state of
(Fe_(1 − δ)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − δ) at 15 K, where the linewidth increases
rapidly upon Cu doping and then saturates. This implies that Cu
substitution induces a magnetic moment so that the line broadening is
dominated by magnetic disorder, rather

axis, is explained in the text.

than by structural disorder. Judging by the rapid increase in the ⁷⁷Se
NMR linewidth, the disorder effects may or may not correlate with the
rapid suppression of $T_{\rm c}$ by the Cu doping. In contrast, the ⁶³Cu
linewidth [Fig. 8(b)] gradually decreases with the Cu doping, which
suggests that the induced moments are not at the Cu sites but at Fe
sites.

So why do ⁶³Cu and ⁷⁷Se linewidths behave so differently? Normally the
NMR spectrum becomes wider and more asymmetric when the increase in
doping level is begun.[16, 17] But here, the ⁶³Cu linewidth can come
from both the doping-induced magnetic shift distribution, and the powder
patterns due to the anisotropic shifts and quadrupolar effects. The
broad shoulders, on both sides of the central peak, are caused by the
quadrupolar broadening. Because these broad shoulders stay nearly
unchanged, unlike the central peak which sharpens at higher Cu doping,
the quadrupolar effects probably do not cause the narrowing of the
central peak. Note that the centroid of the spectrum moves closer to the
unshifted reference line at higher Cu doping, which implies that the Cu
nuclei do not much feel the hyperfine fields, from the neighboring Fe/Cu
spins, at a higher doping levels. Since there is no direct chemical
bonding between the Cu and Fe atoms, part of the ⁶³Cu frequency shift at
low Cu doping comes from the transferred hyperfine coupling, mediated by
the conduction electrons. For higher Cu doping, we suspect that the
metal-insulator transition reduces the number of conduction electrons so
that the transferred hyperfine coupling becomes weaker. Therefore, both
the magnetic shift and linewidth decrease at higher Cu doping. This is
different from the ⁷⁷Se spectra, where there is direct wave-function
overlap between the Se 4p and Fe 3d electrons so that the ⁷⁷Se nucleus
can always effectively probe the Fe spins, to show a broader linewidth
at higher doping (Fig. 9).

As with Se-deficient FeSe, stretched exponential behavior is observed in
the spin-lattice relaxation curves for all (Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − ϕ).
Their average (T₁T)⁻¹ curves are plotted in Fig. 6. Within experimental
error, all of our samples show similar average 1/(T₁T) behavior, the
values increasing at lower temperature. Interestingly, Cu substitution
does not alter spin fluctuation in FeSe_(0.88), though Cu²⁺ possesses a
spin different from Fe²⁺. We note that both superconducting volume
fraction and $T_{\rm c}$ rapidly decreases, upon Cu doping. This is
different from the Se-deficient samples, where only superconducting
volume fraction reduces significantly. The similar superconducting
volume fraction, found in (Fe_(0.99)Cu_(0.01))Se_(0.85) and
(Fe_(0.98)Cu_(0.02))Se_(0.88), could be an effect of compensation, due
to the different values of x and δ. Recent transport experiments, on
(Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − ϕ) have shown that increasing Cu doping
migrates the metallic state to a Mott insulator.[11, 12] Therefore, we
suspect that the suppression of $T_{\rm c}$ is mainly due to the change
in the electronic states rather than the spin dynamics.

In summary, we conducted comprehensive studies of the ⁷⁷Si NMR in the
Se-deficient and Cu-substituted FeSe. By comparing our data with
previous literature, we infer that FeSe_(1 − δ) has an inhomogeneous
phase, where the superconductivity emerges from regions with little or
no Se vacancy. As for the $T_{\rm c}$ suppression in
(Fe_(1 − x)Cu_(x))Se_(1 − ϕ) magnetic fluctuations are not directly
relevant. We suspect that it is the electronic states that change most
with Cu substitution so that a metal-insulator transition arises after
$T_{\rm c}$ is suppressed.
