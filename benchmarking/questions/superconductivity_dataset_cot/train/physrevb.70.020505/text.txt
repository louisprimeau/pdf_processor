###### Abstract

Pressure studies of CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) indicate two superconducting phases as a function of \(x\), one with \(T_{c}\)\(\approx\) 2 K for \(x\)\(<\) 0.9 and the other with \(T_{c}\)\(<\) 1.2 K for \(x\)\(>\) 0.9. The higher \(T_{c}\) phase, phase 1, emerges in proximity to an antiferromagnetic quantum-critical point; whereas, Cooper pairing in the lower \(T_{c}\) phase 2 is inferred to arise from fluctuations of a yet to be found magnetic state. The \(T\)-\(x\)-\(P\) phase diagram of CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\), though qualitatively similar, is distinctly different from that of CeCu\({}_{2}\)(Si\({}_{1-x}\)Ge\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\).

 superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry to ensure the absence of free In. Pressures to 2.3 GPa were generated in a Be-Cu clamp-type cell with Flourinert as the pressure-transmitting medium, and at least seven, approximately equally spaced, pressure measurements were made on each composition. The inductively measured shift in the superconducting transition of high purity Sn or Pb determined the clamped pressure at low temperatures.

Figure 1 shows the electrical resistivity at various pressures for \(x\) = 0, 0.5, and 1 in CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\). These responses are representative of the series. For \(x\) \(<\) 0.5, the low-temperature resistivity increases initially with applied pressure and the temperature \(T_{\rm max}\) at which the resistivity is a maximum (not shown) decreases with \(P\). Near and above \(x\) = 0.5, opposite trends appear--the low-temperature resistivity decreases and the resistivity maximum moves to higher temperatures with applied pressure. As seen in Fig. 1, Rh/Ir substitutions have a small effect on potential scattering since the limiting resistivity just above either an antiferromagnetic or superconducting phase transition at atmospheric or high pressure varies from about 2 \(\mu\)m\(\Omega\) cm for \(x\) = 0 and 1.0 to about 7 \(\mu\)m\(\Omega\) cm for \(x\) = 0.5. Qualitatively, this reflects Nordheim's rule for isovalent substitutions [15] and is a further indication of sample homogeneity. Superimposed on this frozen disorder scattering are comparable or larger pressure-dependent changes in the inelastic scattering rate. For \(x\) \(<\) 0.5, pressure enhances the scattering rate as magnetic order is replaced by superconductivity; whereas, for \(x\) = 0.5, the scattering rate at atmospheric pressure is already relatively large and decreases with applied pressure, and this trend continues with increasing \(x\). The variation in the low-temperature resistivity of this CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) series at atmospheric pressure is analogous to responses found in several antiferromagnets as they are tuned by applied pressure toward a quantum critical point. [16] This analogy argues that Ir substitution for Rh acts principally as an effective applied pressure and that there is a quantum-critical point at atmospheric pressure in the series near \(x\) \(\approx\) 0.5. Indeed, the ambient-pressure Neel temperature drops to \(T\) = 0 at \(x_{\rm c}\) \(\approx\) 0.65 where the specific heat begins to diverge logarithmically, [17] and, as shown in Fig. 2, Ir substitution and applied pressure are demonstrably equivalent for \(x\) \(\approx\) 0.25. The rigid shift by a constant pressure of the superconducting transition _T_\({}_{c}\)(_P_), the Neel temperature _T_\({}_{N}\)(_P_), and the temperature _T_\({}_{\rm max}\)(_P_), where the resistivity is a maximum, scales each onto a common curve. For these three compositions, the rigid pressure shift _P_\({}_{c}\)(GPa) \(\approx\) 10\(x^{2}\), which, extrapolating to \(x\) = 1, implies that CeIrIn\({}_{5}\) is under an effective chemical pressure of about 10 GPa relative to CeRhIn\({}_{5}\). This straightforward scaling breaks down for \(x\) \(>\) 0.3, indicating additional effects of Ir substitution.

Linear interpolations of _T_\({}_{c}\)(_P_), defined by the onset of a diamagnetic response in ac susceptibility, and _T_\({}_{N}\)(_P_), determined from a change in slope of \(\rho\)(_T_), for each value of \(x\) allow the construction of isobaric _T_\(-\)_x_ phase diagrams. Data in the upper panel of Fig. 3 are results from ambient-pressure measurements, [11] and those in the middle and lower panels are representative _T_\(-\)x diagrams at pressures of 1.0 and 1.75 GPa. Similar isobaric diagrams at intermediate pressures confirm the smooth evolution seen in Fig. 3, and, in particular, the _T_\(-\)_x_ phase diagram at 2 GPa shows no evidence for antiferromagnetism. As seen in Fig. 3, the cusplike suppression of _T_\({}_{c}\) near \(x\) = 0.9 at \(P\) = 0 evolves with applied pressure to become a range of compositions 0.75 \(\leq\)_x_ \(\leq\) 0.85, where no bulk superconductivity is detected above 0.3 K by ac susceptibility. Therefore, in CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) under pressure, there is a range of compositions separating two superconducting phases, phase 1 with _T_\({}_{c}\) \(\approx\) 2 K for \(x\) \(<\) 0.75 and phase 2 with _T_\({}_{c}\) \(<\) 1.2 K for \(x\) \(>\) 0.85. [18]

Data, shifted by constant pressures of 0, 0.1, and 0.6 GPa for \(x\) = 0, 0.1 and 0.25, respectively, scale onto common curves as shown.

  The results of Fig. 3 appear analogous to the evolution of \(T_{c}(y,P)\) in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{y}\)Be\({}_{13}\), particularly, if we consider CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) as Rh-doped CeIrIn\({}_{5}\), as well as to the observation of two superconducting phases in CeCu\({}_{2}\)(Si,Ge)\({}_{2}\). In the latter, each dome of superconductivity is controlled by proximity to a distinctly different transition that is tuned to \(T\)\(\rightarrow\) 0 by pressure. This conclusion was possible by realizing that Ge substitution for Si expands the unit-cell volume and that this expansion can be compensated by an externally applied pressure to produce nearly identical superconducting phase diagrams as a function of cell volume for both CeCu\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) and CeCu\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\)[8]. A similar argument is inferred from the pressure scaling shown in Fig. 2. If the primary role of Ir substitutions for Rh is to decrease the cell volume, then the observation of two superconducting phases in CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) suggests that a second superconducting phase also might emerge in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) at much higher pressures than investigated here. Besides a dome of superconductivity centered near the antiferromagnetic critical point at \(P_{c}\)\(\approx\) 2.5 GPa, where \(T_{c}\) exceeds 2 K, Muramatsu _et al._[19] have reported a second dome of superconductivity in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) with a maximum \(T_{c}\)\(\approx\) 1 K near 6.5 GPa. Considering that details of Ir/Rh substitution were ignored in estimating the effective pressure in CeIrIn\({}_{5}\), this estimate and the observed pressure of 6.5 GPa are in good agreement and further suggest that the second, high-pressure dome of superconductivity in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) is analogous to phase-2 superconductivity in CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\).

This simple volume-based extrapolation was implied from the empirical observation that \(P_{c}\)\(\propto\)\(x^{2}\) for \(\approx\) 0.25. Studies at atmospheric pressure show, however, that \(T_{c}\)'s of CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) are a linear function of the ratio of tetragonal lattice parameters \(c\)/\(a\) and not cell volume (\(a^{2}c\))[20]. This apparent dichotomy suggests that \(c\)/\(a\) is not a monotonic function of pressure even though the cell volume is. Pressure-dependent structural studies of CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) confirm this suggestion[21]: \(c\)/\(a\) exhibits two maxima as a function of pressure, one near 2.5 GPa and a second near 6 GPa. The correspondence between these maxima and those in \(T_{c}\)(\(P\)) reinforces the relationship between \(T_{c}\) and \(c\)/\(a\) found in the Rh/Ir solid solutions at atmospheric pressure. The pronounced nonmonotonic variation of \(c\)/\(a\)(\(P\)) in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\), though not directly established in other members of CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) or in isostructural CeCoIn\({}_{5}\), also may account for the different responses of \(T_{c}\) to uniaxial pressure observed in CeIrIn\({}_{5}\) and CeCoIn\({}_{5}\)[22].

Though the emergence of two superconducting phases in CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) and CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) under pressure appears similar to the nonmonotonic variation of \(T_{c}\)(\(P\)) in CeCu\({}_{2}\)(Si, Ge)\({}_{2}\), there is an important distinction. In the latter, there are well-defined regimes of pressure where \(T_{c}\)\(<\)1 K and \(T_{c}\)\(>\) 2 K, but, the high-pressure, high-\(T_{c}\) regime is accompanied by topological changes in the Fermi surface[23] and/or an increase in ground-state degeneracy[24, 25] so that superconductivity with different \(T_{c}\)'s develops out of qualitatively different electronic states. This is not true in CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) and CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) under pressure. de Haas-van Alphen studies find that, except for expected quantitative changes due to their slightly different ratio of tetragonal lattice parameters, CeIrIn\({}_{5}\) at \(P\)=0 and superconducting CeRhIn\({}_{5}\)(\(P\)\(>\) 0) have the same Fermi-surface topology and comparably large quasiparticle masses[26, 27]. Furthermore, at atmospheric pressure, the electronic entropy to 5 K is (0.5\(\pm\)0.05)\(R\) ln 2 for all \(x\)[11], indicating the same ground-state degeneracy.

On the basis of scaling shown in Fig. 2, we assume reasonably that superconductivity in phase 1 has the same origin as in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) near and below 2.5 GPa, namely that superconductivity is mediated by excitations associated with proximity to an antiferromagnetic quantum-critical point. The pairing mechanism for phase-2 superconductivity is not so obvious since antiferromagnetic order appears to be well removed from this part of the phase diagram and there is no evidence for a line of valence transitions as a function of \(x\) or \(P\). Like superconductivity in phase 1 where \(C\)/\(T\)\(\propto\)\(T\) and \(1/T_{1}\)\(\propto\)\(T^{3}\) below \(T_{c}\), the same power laws are found[28] in CeIrIn\({}_{5}\), which is representative of phase-2 superconductivity, and indicate an unconventional mechanism for superconductivity in phase 2. The pairing mechanism for phase 2 is suggested from thermal expansion measurements on CeIrIn\({}_{5}\) in a field sufficient to destroy bulk superconductivity. In these experiments, the coefficient of \(c\)-axis thermal expansion \(c_{x}\)=\(aT^{0.5}\)+\(bT\), a temperature dependence expected for thermal expansion dominated by three-dimensional critical fluctuations at an antiferromagnetic quantum-critical point[22]. These observations, together with a non-Fermi-liquid like \(1/T_{1}\) above \(T_{c}\) in CeIrIn\({}_{5}\)[14, 29] imply that phase-2 superconductivity in CeRh\({}_{1-x}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)In\({}_{5}\) for \(x\)\(>\) 0.85 and, by inference, in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) at \(P\)\(>\) 5 GPa is mediated by fluctuations arising from some form of hidden magnetic order. One possibility is that this hidden order manifests itself in field-induced magnetic transitions observed in CeIrIn\({}_{5}\), near 40 T (Ref. [30]) and in CeRhIn\({}_{5}\) near 50 T[31]. Whatever the precise nature of this

The cusplike suppression of \(T_{c}\) near \(x\)=0.9 at \(P\)=0 evolves into a range of compositions where \(T_{c}\)\(<\)0.3 K at higher pressures. Plots of \(T_{c}\)(\(P\)) for \(x\)=0.75 and 0.85 (not shown explicitly) strongly suggest that \(T_{c}\)=0 for these compositions at 1.75 GPa and higher pressures. SC1: phase-1 superconductivity; SC2: phase-2 superconductivity.

  hidden magnetic order, the lower \(T_{c}\) of phase-2 superconductivity suggests that pair-mediating fluctuation spectrum is more nearly three-dimensional, coupling electronic states less efficiently than magnetic excitations associated with \(T_{N}\) and phase-1 superconductivity.
