###### Abstract

The temperature dependence of the resistivity \(\rho(T)\) and the thermoelectric power \(\alpha(T)\) have been measured under hydrostatic pressure on a single-crystal film of La\({}_{1.85}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) deposited on a LaSrAlO\({}_{4}\) substrate. The compressive biaxial stress built into the film raises \(T_{c}\) at ambient pressure. \(T_{c}\) increased with pressure \(P\)\(<\)3.3 kbar, but saturated at a pressure-independent \(T_{c}\)=43.7 at pressures \(P\)\(>\)3.3 kbar. A low-temperature enhancement of \(\alpha(T)\) having a \(T_{\rm max}\)\(\approx\)140 K increased with \(T_{c}\). The data are discussed within the framework of a vibronic model of the superconductive phase.

La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) is the simplest of the superconductive copper-oxide systems. It contains no charge-reservoir layer, which makes unambiguous the number of holes per Cu atom in the superconductive CuO\({}_{2}\) sheets once the doping concentration \(x\) and the chemical stoichiometry are established. Systematic study[1] has revealed an evolution with \(x\) from antiferromagnetic insulator to superconductor and finally to normal metal, as illustrated by the partial phase diagram of Fig. 1. The superconductive compositions appear to represent a distinguishable thermodynamic state below room temperature,[2] with a maximum critical temperature \(T_{\rm max}\)\(\approx\)36 K occurring in an orthorhombic single-phase composition with \(x\) = 0.15.[3] The distortion from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry buckles the Cu-O-Cu bond angle from 180\({}^{\circ}\) to (180\({}^{\circ}\) - \(\phi\)) to relieve the compressive stress on the CuO\({}_{2}\) sheets introduced by a mismatch of the (La,Sr)-O and Cu-O equilibrium bond lengths. This distortion decreases with increasing temperature and Sr concentration \(x\). At \(T_{c}\), the orthorhombic-tetragonal transition occurs at an x\(\approx\)0.21.[4]

The charge-carrier concentration of 0.15\(\leq\)\(x\)\(\leq\)0.20 per Cu in a CuO\({}_{2}\) sheet appears to give the maximum \(T_{c}\) in all cuprate superconductors. An additional feature influencing \(T_{c}\) is the (180\({}^{\circ}\)-\(\phi\)) Cu-O-Cu bond angle within a CuO\({}_{2}\) sheet. An anomalously large compressibility of the Cu-O bond within a CuO\({}_{2}\) sheet,[3] which is due to a transition from localized to itinerant behavior of the antibonding electrons that \(\sigma\) bond in a CuO\({}_{2}\) sheet,[6] causes hydrostatic pressure to straighten the (180\({}^{\circ}\)-\(\phi\)) Cu-O-Cu bond angle. Previous measurements[7, 8] on ceramic samples with \(x\)\(\geq\)0.18 in Be-Cu pressure cells have shown that \(T_{c}\) initially increases linearly with hydrostatic pressure in the orthorhombic phase, but changes abruptly to a pressure-independent value at a critical pressure \(P_{c}\) that, like the orthorhombic-tetragonal transition temperature \(T_{r}\), decreases with increasing \(x\). Moreover, a high-pressure x-ray study[9] has shown that pressure stabilizes the tetragonal phase of the 214 structure, so we assume that the change in slope of \(T_{c}\) versus \(P\) at \(P_{c}\) reflects the orthorhombic-tetragonal transition. In any case, saturation of \(T_{c}\) occurs in a phase with flat, or nearly so, CuO\({}_{2}\) sheets as pressure reduces the bending angle \(\phi\) of the (180\({}^{\circ}\)-\(\phi\)) Cu-O-Cu bond. The dependence of \(T_{c}\) on the bending angle \(\phi\) is also apparent from a comparison of \(T_{c}\) for the same \(x\) of the isostructural systems La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) and La\({}_{2-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\).[10] However, limitation to pressures \(P\)\(<\)20 kbar with a Be-Cu cell prevented us from access to critical pressure \(P_{c}\) in an \(x\) = 0.15 ceramic sample. In this paper we report access to this transition with a Be-Cu pressure cell in an \(x\) = 0.15 thin-film sample that is under a two-dimensional compressive stress as a result of bond-length mismatch with the substrate. We define optimal superconductivity in the La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system as that having the highest value of \(T_{c}\) obtainable under pressure in the optimally doped (\(x\) = 0.15) composition.

Sato and Naito[11] demonstrated that La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) films

 oriented with the \(c\) axis perpendicular to the substrate have \(T_{c}\) reduced by a tensile stress on the CuO\({}_{2}\) sheets if deposited on SrTiO\({}_{3}\), and have \(T_{c}\) increased by a compressive stress if deposited on LaSrAlO\({}_{4}\). A La\({}_{1.85}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) film on LaSrAlO\({}_{4}\) remained orthorhombic at \(T\)= \(T_{0}\), but had \(T_{c}\)\(\approx\) 43 K compared to \(T_{c}\)\(\approx\) 36 K in an unstressed ceramic or single-crystal specimen. We therefore undertook to investigate whether, with a Be-Cu pressure cell, we could add hydrostatic pressure to the two-dimensional compressive stress already in the film so as to access the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition. Three questions motivated this experiment: (1) Does \(T_{c}\) increase to a maximum value at \(P_{c}\) in an optimally doped sample? (2) What is the maximum value of \(T_{c}\) attainable in the La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system and is it influenced by a biaxial component of the pressure? (3) Does the low-temperature enhancement of the thermoelectric power that we[12] have associated with the superconductive phase increase to a maximum with \(T_{c}\)? Finally, we consider the implications of the observed angular dependence of \(T_{c}\) for a '-vibronic' model of the superconductive phase.

The single-crystal L\({}_{1.85}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) film studied was deposited on LaSrAlO\({}_{4}\) at NTT, Japan. Details of the procedure for making the films can be found in Ref. [11]. The film with \(T_{0}\) = 43.8 K as measured at NTT was found at Austin to have \(T_{0}\)= 43.0 K, where \(T_{0}\) is the temperature below which no voltage is resolvable with a nanovoltmeter. A higher resolution at Austin revealed a small shoulder at low resistivity that lowered \(T_{0}\) by 0.4 K. The other 0.4-K discrepancy appears to be due to a difference in the calibration of the thermometers. The measurement error at Austin is \(\Delta\)\(T_{0}\)\(<\)0.2 K. The Be-Cu high-pressure apparatus and a description of the measurement of physical properties have been reported elsewhere.[13]

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity within the basal plane, \(\rho_{ab}(T)\); it is identical to single-crystal data[14] and to independent measurements on films.[15] Above 100 K, \(\rho(T)\) can be fit perfectly to a linear relationship that extrapolates to zero near \(T\)= 0 K. Hydrostatic pressure does not alter this linear temperature dependence, but it increases \(T_{0}\) from 43 to 43.7 K within 3.3 kbar. \(T_{0}\) saturates for \(P\)\(\approx\) 3.3 kbar (Figs. 3 and 4) indicative of a \(P_{c}\)\(\approx\) 3.3 kbar in our film.

At ambient pressure, the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power \(\alpha(T)\) of Fig. 5 is similar to that found for ceramic samples.[16] Also as in the ceramic samples, the low-temperature enhancement of \(\alpha(T)\) with a \(T_{\rm max}\)\(\approx\) 140 K increases significantly with \(T_{c}\) below 3.3 kbar. In the \(x\) = 0.15 ceramic samples, \(T_{c}\) and the enhancement do not saturate within the pressure range accessible in a Be-Cu pressure cell. However, in the films the enhancement increases only weakly with \(P\) at \(P\)\(>\)3.3 kbar, where \(T_{c}\) is pressure independent (Fig. 4).

The \(T_{c}\)-\(P\) curve in Fig. 4 suggests that the film is still orthorhombic under ambient pressure but much closer to the transition at \(P_{c}\) than a ceramic specimen, which is orthorhombic for \(P\)\(<\)20 kbar.[7] Figure 4 confirms that the film is under the epitaxial stress caused by the lattice mismatch with the substrate. our estimation for the in-plane epitaxial stress of about 16 kbar[11] shows good agreement with the difference between \(P_{c}\)\(\approx\) 3.3 kbar for the film and \(P_{c}\)\(\approx\) 20 kbar for the ceramic sample.[7] Moreover, the low-temperature enhancement of \(\alpha(T)\), which is not due to phonon drag, is found to increase with \(T_{c}\) in the pressure range 0\(\leq\)\(P\)\(\leq\) 3.3 kbar; it

  retains a smaller pressure dependence for \(P\) > 3.3 kbar, even though the films already appear to be tetragonal at a _T_max ~140 K at ambient pressure. We suggest that this observation indicates that the transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry is not sharp in the normal state, short-range orthorhombic distortions persisting well above the long-range ordering temperature. \(T_{c}\) = 43.7 K for the film in the tetragonal phase is nearly 2 K higher than the maximum \(T_{c}\)  42 K obtained under hydrostatic pressure for the bulk.1 This gain in \(T_{c}\) is associated with the two-dimensional component of the stress on the film, which has \(T_{c}\) = 43 K at ambient pressure. Even higher \(T_{c}\) is expected for a tetragonal sample with higher compressive stress in the _a-b_ plane and large _c_-axis extensions. In fact, \(T_{c}\) = 49 K was recently reported for a thin film of La19Sr01CuO4 with a large compression of the _a-b_ plane and a large _c_-axis extension by the epitaxial strain.18

To interpret the significance of this dependence on the angle _ph_, we turn finally to a _vibronic_ model of the superconductive phase. The superconductive phase in La2-Sr2CuO4 appears at a crossover from localized-electron behavior in the antiferromagnetic insulator La2CuO4 to Fermi-liquid electronic behavior in the overdoped compositions with \(x\)  0.30. The equilibrium Cu-O bond length for localized electrons is larger than that for itinerant electrons,6 and a double-well potential for the Cu-O bond length at crossover is responsible not only for the large compressibility of the Cu-O bond in the superconductive phase, but also for phase segregation between the antiferromagnetic phase and clusters or stripes rich in charge carriers. Two of us have shown2,19 that in the underdoped compositions 0<_x_ < 0.10, a mobile charge carrier is confined to a cluster of five copper centers by interaction with the antiferromagnetic matrix. We have also argued20 that in the optimally doped compositions these clusters form a strongly interacting "polaron gas" at high temperatures that condenses into a "polaron liquid" below room temperature. At that time we did not specify the nature of this liquid, but later experiments21,22 indicated that the hole-rich regions become ordered below \(T_{l}\) into stripes separated by localized-electron magnetic-stripes that, in the La2-Sr2CuO4 structure, are oriented alternately along tetragonal [100] and [010] directions, the (_p_,0) and (0,_p_) directions of the CuO2 sheet on traversing the \(c\) axis. In the low-temperature-tetragonal (LTT) phase of La18Ba012CuO4, these stripes are pinned and are therefore directly detectable with neutron diffraction.22 Superconductivity is suppressed where the stripes are stationary:23,24 it reappears in the LTT phase if the stripes are depinned under pressure, and \(T_{c}\) increases with pressure.25 It follows that superconductivity is associated with mobile stripes and that these stripes are to be distinguished from a conventional charge-density wave that introduces an energy gap at the Fermi energy. These stripes appear to be the consequence of a phase segregation that is accomplished by cooperative oxygen-atom displacements in the CuO2 sheets rather than by any atomic diffusion.21 Clearly the charge carriers must couple strongly to the oxygen displacements for phase segregation into the stripes to occur. This strong electron-lattice coupling would be retained with mobile stripes as well as with mobile clusters of five copper centers. The linear temperature dependence of \(r_{b}\)(_T_) extends to 1000 K without saturation,15 which indicates that the mobility of the charge carriers is not determined by a Boltzmann scattering mechanism. Strong electron coupling to mobile stripes or clusters would make the normal-state charge carriers move diffusively, but with any activation energy \(E_{a}\) < _kT_ for \(T\) > \(T_{c}\) , thereby giving a charge-carrier mobility \(m\) ~ _T_-1 and \(r_{b}\) ~ \(T\). The problem is to find a way to describe the transformation from cluster molecular orbitals to itinerant charge carriers coupled to mobile stripes.

Electron coupling to mobile stripes would be to the phonons with propagation vector **q** parallel to the vector **Q** of the stripe periodicity in a CuO2 plane. These phonons would have the same symmetry as an itinerant electron of wave vector **k** having a component in the direction **Q**, so we can expect an admixture of phonons and electrons to give _itinerant vibronic states_ traveling in the direction of **Q**. The admixture of traveling electronic and phononic states would transform the electronic heterogeneity of mobile clusters or static stripes into a homogeneous system as required by the theories of vortex formation and pinning. Moreover, it would give a stabilization energy \(\Delta \varepsilon \sim ({\bf k} \cdot {\bf Q})^2\) in a given CuO2 sheet. Averaging over successive sheets, the stabilization would go as (cos_th_ + sin_th_)(cos_th_ - sin_th_)~cos2_th_, which corresponds to _d_-wave symmetry. Moreover, the number of states so stabilized would increase with the ordering of the mobile stripes, and hence with decreasing temperature, in the polaron-liquid phase appearing in the interval \(T_{c}\) < \(T\) < \(T_{l}\)  300 K. A transfer of spectral weight from (_p_,_p_) to the (_p_,0) and (0,_p_) directions with decreasing temperature would flatten the _e__**k**(**k**)curves in the (_p_,0) and (0,_p_) directions, so as to enhance _a_(_T_) to a maximum value at _T_max. The onset of Cooper-pair fluctuations in the interval \(T_{c}\) < \(T\) < _T_max would increasingly lower _a_(_T_) as \(T\) approached \(T_{c}\) in the interval \(T_{c}\) < \(T\) < _T_max. Consistent with this model is the quite spectacular observation of a progressive transfer of spectral weight from the (_p_,_p_) to the (_p_,0) and (0,_p_) directions in the CuO2 sheets on lowering the temperature from 300 K to \(T_{c}\).26,27 In this model, the _d_-wave superconductivity below \(T_{c}\) reflects a coupling between itinerant vibronic states. The itinerant electrons with **k** parallel to the stripes

  are not coupled to the phonons and may give a measurable _s_-wave component to the superconductive energy gap D.

Within this model, the influence of the Cu-O-Cu bond angle on \(T_{c}\) might be attributed to (1) a change in the oxygen vibrational frequency \(o_{O}\) within a bond, (2) an enhanced Cu-O covalent mixing, or (3) a weaker pinning and hence greater mobility of the stripes. Although there is strong evidence that \(o_{O}\) would increase with the Cu-O-Cu bond angle, we rule out the first alternative as there is little effect on \(T_{c}\) of 18O/16O isotope exchange in optimally doped copper oxides. We might rule out the second alternative because \(T_{c}\) is unchanged by pressure in the tetragonal phase even though pressure should continue to increase the Cu-O covalent mixing after the Cu-O-Cu bond angle is straightened. Indeed, \(T_{c}\) has been reported [17] to decrease at high pressures \(P\) > 4 GPa in overdoped tetragonal samples. On the other hand, an anisotropic compressibility may invalidate this deduction, since a large _c_-axis compression under hydrostatic pressure may make the increase in _c_-axis covalent bonding compete with any increase in covalence in the _a_-_b_ plane. With only a two-dimensional compressive stress, \(T_{c}\) appears to be higher in the tetragonal phase. A maximum \(T_{c}\) = 42 K under hydrostatic pressure [17] is to be compared with a \(T\)0 = 43.7 K in the film samples, and a \(T_{c}\) > \(T\)0 makes the difference even larger. Finally, the increase with pressure in the enhancement of _a_(_T_) would, in the vibronic model, signal a more facile coherence of stripe segments within the polaron-liquid normal state, which would be compatible with achieving the long-range coherence needed for superconductivity at a higher \(T_{c}\). We are thus led to the conclusion that bending of the Cu-O-Cu bond angle makes more difficult the long-range ordering of the mobile stripes that is required for superconductivity.

In conclusion, the (tetragonal) phase having a pressure-independent \(T_{c}\) has been approached under hydrostatic pressure in an optimally doped La2-xSrCuO4 thin film. The flat CuO2 sheets have been shown to give a maximum \(T_{c}\) under ambient or hydrostatic pressure. In contrast to the maximum \(T_{c}\) of a ceramic sample under hydrostatic pressure, the two-dimensional stress on the CuO2 sheets of a film give an extra gain in \(T_{c}\), which points to a way to increase \(T_{c}\) in these anisotropic materials. The enhancement at \(T\) ~ 140 K in the thermoelectric power has been confirmed to change with \(T_{c}\) regardless of whether the gain in \(T_{c}\) is due to a flattening of the CuO2 sheets or to a two-dimensional stress.
