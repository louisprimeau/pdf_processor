###### Abstract

We report both ⁷⁷Se and ⁸⁷Rb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on
Tl0.47Rb0.34Fe1.63Se2 single-crystalline superconductors (T_(c) ≈ 32 K).
Singlet superconductivity is suggested by a sharp drop of the Knight
shift K(T) below T_(c), after subtracting the superconducting
diamagnetic effect. However, the Hebel-Slichter coherence peak below
T_(c) is not observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T₁, even
with a low in-plane NMR field of 2.6 T. Just above T_(c), no evidence of
low-energy spin fluctuation is found in the spin-lattice relaxation rate
on both the ⁷⁷Se and the ⁸⁷Rb sites. Upon warming, however, the Knight
shifts and the spin-lattice relaxation rates of both nuclei increase
substantially with temperature. In particular, the Knight shift is
nearly isotropic and follow a function fit of K = a + bT² from T_(c) up
to 300 K. Our observations should put a strong constraint to the theory
of magnetism and superconductivity in the recently discovered iron
selenide superconductors.

## I Introduction

As the second type of high-temperature superconductors after cuprates,
the iron-based superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4] have attracted a lot of
research interests in recent years. The iron pnictide superconductors
are remarkable in that they originate from antiferromagnetic (AFM)
semimetals [4] and have multiple electron and hole bands on the Fermi
surface which are gapped in the superconducting state. [5, 6] Lately, a
family of iron selenide superconductors, with nominal chemical formulas
A_(y)Fe_(2 − x)Se₂ or (TI, A_(y))Fe_(2 − x)Se₂ (A = K, Rb, Cs). [7, 8,
9, 10, 11] have been discovered within a T_(c) as high as 33 K.
Comparing with iron pnictides, this iron selenide family shows
qualitatively different properties in lattice structure, band structure,
and magnetic properties, as described below, and thus enrich and
challenge our understanding of the iron-based superconductivity.

First, the composition of this type of superconductors is suggested to
be close to A_(0.8)Fe_(1.6)Se₂ by the x-ray and the neutron diffraction
structure refinement studies. [12, 13] This chemical stoichiometry leads
to an almost perfect Fe-vacancy order in superconductors with a
$\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}\times 1$ supercell at low temperatures. [12, 13,
14, 15, 16] Second, the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) studies found that the hole bands centered at the Γ point sink
below the Fermi level, [17, 18] which is different from previous iron
pnictide and chalcogenide superconductors. [19, 20, 21] Third, nodeless
superconducting gaps are observed on the electron pockets on the Fermi
surface. [17, 18, 21, 20, 21] NMR studies on nominal K0.8Fe_(2 − x)Se₂
show a singlet pairing symmetry from the Knight shift, whereas the
Hebel-Slichter coherence peak is not observed in the spin-lattice
relaxation rate. [22] The s^(±) gap symmetry, proposed in iron pnictides
with interband transitions, [23, 24] may not be applicable here because
of the absence of the hole band on the Fermi surface. Finally, an AFM
order with large magnetic moments (2.3-3.3 μ_(B)/Fe) has been determined
by neutron diffraction [13, 32] for all of the these iron selenide
superconductors and possibly coexists with bulk superconductivity, as
indicated by the μSR and other bulk measurements. [13, 26, 27] From NMR,
however, the Curie-Weiss upturn in 1/T₁T, as an indication of low-energy
spin fluctuations observed in most iron pnictides, [28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
33, 34, 35] is not seen in K0.8Fe_(2 − x)Se₂ (Ref. [22]).

In the previous NMR studies, the superconducting diamagnetic effect is
not counted, which may preclude a strong evidence for a singlet pairing.
[23, 36, 37] It should also be noted that the large NMR magnetic field
used in those studies may suppress the Hebel-Slichter coherence peak.
Furthermore, a large increase of the Knight shifts and the spin-lattice
relaxation rates with temperature are also observed in the normal state
with an unknown origin. So far NMR data are only available in
K0.8Fe_(2 − x)Se₂. NMR studies in the same structure family are seeking
to verify and understand these observations.

In this paper, we report both ⁷⁷Se and ⁸⁷Rb NMR studies on a
single-crystalline Tl0.47Rb0.34Fe1.63Se2 superconductor. The paper is
organized as following. First, we compare the Knight shifts of ⁷⁷Se and
⁸⁷Rb in the superconducting state. The superconducting diamagnetic
effect are evaluated, owing to the differences in the hyperfine coupling
strength of the two nuclei. Second, we investigate the spin-lattice
relaxation rate under different NMR fields below T_(c). The coherence
peak is not observed even with a 2.6-T in-plane field. Finally, we study
the Knight shift and the spin-lattice relaxation rate in the normal
state and discuss the possible spin fluctuations. Detailed comparisons
with K0.8Fe_(2 − x)Se₂ are also given in the paper.

## II Experimental techniques and results

The Tl0.47Rb0.34Fe1.63Se2 single crystals were synthesized by the
Bridgeman method. [11] The chemical composition, determined by the
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, is consistent with the Fe
vacancy order in a general stoichiometric structure of
A_(0.8)Fe_(1.6)Se₂ (or A₂Fe₄Se₅). [14] In this paper, we primarily
report our results on one single crystal with dimensions of ∼5 x 3 x 1
mm³ (T_(c) ≈ 32 K at zero field). The superconducting transition was
monitored _in situ_ by the ac susceptibility measurements with the NMR
coil. In Fig. 1(a), T_(c) is shown at about 31 K with an 11.62-T field
oriented along the crystalline c axis.

The ⁷⁷Se (S = 1/2) NMR is performed under an 11.62-T NMR field, and ⁸⁷Rb
(S = 3/2) NMR is performed under 11.62- and 2.6-T fields. We also
studied the field anisotropy effect with field along both the
crystalline c axis and the ab plane. Typical ⁷⁷Se spectra with H//c are
shown in Fig. 1(b). A linewidth about 20 kHz is observed at T = 35 K,
and narrows down as temperature increases. Below T_(c), the spectra
broaden and shift to lower frequencies. The ⁸⁷Rb has one center
transition and two satellites (v_(q) ≈ 1.4 MHz, data not shown).

The Knight shifts ⁷⁷K(T) and ⁸⁷K(T) are obtained from
K(T) = (f − γ_(n)B)/γ_(n)B, where f is the measured resonance frequency
at magnetic field B, and ⁷⁷γ_(n) = 8.131 MHz/T and ⁸⁷γ_(n) = 13.931
MHz/T are the gyromagnetic ratios of two respective nuclei. The Knight
shift data of ⁷⁷Se and ⁸⁷Rb are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.

The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T₁ is measured by the
inversion-recovery method and is obtained from the fitting
I(t)/I(0) = 1 − ae^(−t/T1) for ⁷⁷Se and
I(t)/I(0) = 1 − a(0.1e^(−t/T1) + 0.9e^(−t/T1)) for ⁸⁷Rb (a ≥ 1). The
fitting works nicely at all measured temperatures, indicating a single
phase. The 1/⁷⁷T₁ and 1/⁸⁷T₁ data are shown in Figs. 4 and 5,
respectively.

## III The NMR Knight shift and the singlet superconductivity

The ⁷⁷Se Knight shift data of Tl_(0.47)Rb_(0.34)Fe_(1.63)Se₂ are shown
in Fig. 2(a). The measurements were performed with field along either
the ab plane (open diamonds) or the c axis (open circles). Above T_(c),
the ⁷⁷K for both field orientations increases monotonically with
temperature. In fact, both sets of data can be nicely fit by a simple
function K(T) = a + bT² with temperature from T_(c) to 300 K, as shown
in Fig. 2(b). The fitting parameters are given as

Figure 1: (Color online) (a) The temperature shift of the tuning
frequency f of a fixed NMR circuit, with the field (11.62 T) oriented
along the crystalline c axis. The large frequency shift below T_(c) is
related to the ac susceptibility χ_(ac) of the sample, Δf ∝ −χ_(ac).
T_(c) of the sample is determined as 31 ± 1 K with the applied field.
(b) The ⁷⁷Se NMR spectra at different temperatures. For data below 28 K,
the circles represent the integrated spectral intensity, and the solid
lines are Gaussian fits to the data.

condition. The solid line is a guide to the normal state ⁷⁷K. The solid
diamonds with error bars represent the values of ⁷⁷K after subtracting
the superconducting diamagnetic effect (see text).

a ≈ 0.1% and b ≈ 6 × 10⁻⁶%/K² for H//ab and a ≈ 0.1% and
b ≈ 5.5 × 10⁻⁶%/K² for H//c. The low-temperature part of ⁷⁷K(T) is
highlighted in Fig. 2(c) to show a fast drop of ⁷⁷K from T_(c) to
T_(c)/2 (about 15 K) with both field orientations. Below 15 K, the
spectral intensity is very small due to RF screening, and we believe our
Knight shift is not well determined because that vortex core also
contributes to the spectrum.

The ⁸⁷Rb Knight shift data of Tl_(0.4r)Rb_(0.34)Fe_(1.63)Se₂ are shown
in Fig. 3(a). The measurements were performed with field along the
crystalline c axis. Above T_(c), the ⁸⁷K also increases with
temperature, following the same a + bT² behavior (see the solid line
fitting).

We first discuss the Knight shift data in the superconducting state and
its implication to the pairing symmetry. Below T_(c), the total shift K
includes three parts K = K_(d) + K_(s) + K_(c), where K_(d), K_(s), and
K_(c) represent the superconducting diamagnetic shielding, the spin, and
the chemical (or orbital) contribution to the frequency shift. In
principle, K_(c) does not change with temperature, while K_(d) decreases
from zero to negative below T_(c), and K_(s) measures local electron
susceptibility. Therefore, below T_(c), the change of the shift follows
ΔK(T) = ΔK_(s)(T) + ΔK_(d)(T) with ΔK defined as ΔK = K(T) − K(T_(c)).
Usually, the K_(s) and the K_(d) are difficult to separate. In the
current compound, due to a weaker hyperfine coupling on the interlayer
⁸⁷Rb site, as shown by the smaller Knight shift, K_(s) and K_(d) can be
estimated by comparing the ⁷⁷K and the ⁸⁷K under the same field
condition [see Fig. 3(b)], as described below.

Let us first look at the Knight shifts at a specific temperature T = 16
K. The ⁸⁷K decreases by about 0.028 ± 0.004% from T_(c) to 16 K, which
gives the diamagnetic shift of −0.028% < ΔK_(d) < 0.1. It is reasonable
to assume that K_(d) is the same for both nuclei from the same
diamagnetic shielding; therefore, the value of ⁷⁷K_(s) + ⁷⁷K_(c) for
⁷⁷Se should be moved up by the same amount 0.028 ± 0.004% (or less) from
the ⁷⁷K(T) (0.015 ± 0.004%). This gives
⁷⁷K_(s) + ⁷⁷K_(c) ≤ 0.043 ± 0.008% at 16 K, which is far below the guide
line of the normal state ⁷⁷K.

The K_(d) and K_(s) can also be calculated with a higher precision as
follows. We first estimate ⁸⁷K_(s)/⁷⁷K_(s) ≈ 0.4 from the change of the
Knight shift in the temperature range between T_(c) and 300 K, because
the ⁷⁷K and the ⁸⁷K increase with the same T² behavior. Then the values
of K_(d) and K_(s) are separated from the ⁷⁷K and ⁸⁷K data at each
temperature below T_(c), using ⁸⁷K_(s)/⁷⁷K_(s) = 0.4. We plot the
resulting value of ⁷⁷K_(s) + ⁷⁷K_(c) below T_(c) in Fig. 3(b) (the solid
diamonds). The data shown that the diamagnetic shift is less than 0.02%
even at the lowest temperature.

A sharp drop in ⁷⁷K just below T_(c), after the subtraction of the
diamagnetic effect, is clearly seen, indicating a singlet
superconductivity. This confirms the previous results in
K_(0.8)Fe_(2 − x)Se₂, although the diamagnetic effect was not considered
there.[22] The singlet pairing puts a strong constraint to the
superconducting mechanism and narrows down the gap to s-wave, d-wave, or
other even orbital symmetry.

## IV The spin-lattice relaxation rate and the coherence peak

We further study the spin-lattice relaxation rate below T_(c) to
understand the pairing symmetry. Usually, the 1/T₁ far below T_(c)
follows an activation behavior for a conventional s-wave superconductor.
Unfortunately, the strong RF screening of our single-crystal limits our
studies of T₁ to a narrow temperature range below T_(c).

The 1/⁷⁷T₁ data with field oriented along the c axis is shown in Fig. 4.
Above T_(c), the 1/⁷⁷T₁ increases with temperatures. Below T_(c), a
sharp drop of 1/⁷⁷T₁ is clearly shown by the low-temperature highlight
in Fig. 4(b). In Fig. 5, we show the 1/⁸⁷T₁ data of ⁸⁷Rb with a 2.6-T
field oriented along the ab plane. We are able to measure 1/⁸⁷T₁ below
T_(c) due to the higher natural abundance of ⁸⁷Rb. A sharp drop of
1/⁸⁷T₁ is also prominent, as shown in Fig. 5(b).

The above data show that the Hebel-Slichter coherence peak is absent in
the 1/T₁ just below T_(c) for both nuclei. Since the H_(c2)^(ab)(0) is
over 60 T for this class of iron selenide superconductors,[38; 39] the
coherence peak is unlikely to be suppressed with the 2.6-T in-plane
field. The absence of the coherence peak in the current compound is
consistent with the result reported in K_(0.8)Fe_(2 − x)Se₂ (Refs. [22;
36; 37]).

Usually, the absence of a coherence peak is interpreted as evidence for
d-wave or other non-s-wave pairing symmetry. In most iron pnictides, the
coherence peak is not observed by far,[40; 41; 42; 43; 44; 45; 46] which
is proposed as a consequence of the s^(±) pairing symmetry with
interband impurity scattering.[47; 48; 49; 50; 51] In the current iron
selenide superconductors, however, the s^(±) scenario with interband
transitions may not be applicable, because the hole band is absent on
the Fermi surface close to the Γ point. The absence of the coherence
peak suggests that the system is different from a conventional s-wave
superconductor and needs to be further addressed. It may be worthwhile
to note that an s^(±) symmetry is proposed in K_(0.8)Fe_(2 − x)Se₂
considering the coupling between the bonding and the antibonding states
on the Fermi surface.[52]

## V The low-temperature spin dynamics

Next we discuss the magnetic properties from the Knight shift and the
spin-lattice relaxation rate data in the normal state. In Fig. 4(a), the
1/⁷⁷T₁T is plotted versus temperature to compare with the Fermi liquid
behavior (1/T₁T= const.).

Figure 5: (Color online) The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice
rate 1/⁸⁷T₁ with a 2.6-T field oriented along the ab plane. The solid
line is a guide for the eye. Insets: (a) 1/⁸⁷T₁T vs temperature; (b) the
highlighted low-temperature 1/⁸⁷T₁ data.

Our data show that 1/⁷⁷T₁T reaches a constant value when the temperature
is close to T_(c). 1/⁸⁷T₁T also shows a similar temperature dependence
as seen in Fig. 5(a). The Knight shift data, ⁷⁷K and ⁸⁷K, also level off
toward T_(c) [see Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)]. The levels off of both the
Knight shift and the 1/T₁T suggest that the system approaches a normal
Fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures, with a constant density of
states at the Fermi level.

In contrast, the binary iron selenide (FeSe) superconductors show strong
AFM spin fluctuations by a Curie-Weiss upturn in 1/T₁T ∼ 1/(T + Θ)[28]
above T_(c). Similarly, the Curie-Weiss upturn in 1/T₁T has also been
reported in many iron arsenide superconductors.[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
35] The existence of AFM spin fluctuations just above T_(c) in the
previous iron-based superconductors draw a correlation between spin
fluctuations and superconductivity.[28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]

The absence of the Curie-Weiss upturn in 1/⁷⁷T₁T in the current material
and also in K_(0.8)Fe_(2 − x)Se₂[22] suggests that the spin fluctuations
are weak in both compounds, although their T_(c)’s are also high. These
distinctive behaviors of the spin-lattice relaxation rate in the current
iron selenides does not seem to support that the superconductivity has a
magnetic origin. We note that in several iron pnictides with low T_(c),
the spin fluctuations appear to be weak.[36, 37, 38]

However, we should be aware that spin fluctuations may exist in other
forms. For example, some spin fluctuations at the wave vector (±π, ±π)
cannot be detected in the current spin-lattice relaxation rate, due to
the cancellation effect on the Se and Rb sites which are located at the
center of the Fe square. Furthermore, as we show below, the spin
fluctuations may exist in the high-energy modes according to our
high-temperature data.

## VI The High-Temperature Spin Dynamics

To further compare with a Fermi liquid behavior, we plot (T₁T)^(−0.5)
against K(T) in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) for both nuclei. Usually, a Fermi
liquid follows the Korringa relation (T₁T)^(−0.5) ∝ K_(s). As shown in
Fig. 6(a), a linear relation between (T₁T)^(−0.5) and K(T), as demanded
by the Korringa relation, is approximately satisfied for ⁷⁷Se in the
low-temperature limit. However, the Korringa relation is not obeyed in
the high-temperature range, indicating a deviation from the Fermi liquid
behavior. Here we estimated K_(c) ≈ 0 based on the value of K at
T ≪ T_(c), where K_(s)(T) = 0 is expected [see Fig. 3(b)]. For ⁸⁷Rb, the
Korringa relation does not hold either at high temperatures.

Now we look closely at the high-temperature behavior of the Knight shift
and the spin-lattice relaxation rate. The 1/T₁T of two nuclei increases
substantially with temperature. The Knight shift data ⁷⁷K and the ⁸⁷K
increase by over a factor of three, when the temperature increases from
T_(c) to the room temperature, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The Knight
shift ⁷⁷K of K_(0.8)Fe_(2 − x)Se₂ with H//ab is also plotted in Fig.
2(b), and it falls on the same line of the current compound. This
suggests a universal electronic structure in these iron selenide
superconductors. In contrast, in most iron pnictides, the Knight shift
shows a much smaller increase with a linear T behavior.[32]

The anisotropy of the Knight shift is small with
K_(ab)^(ab)/K_(c)^(s) ≈ 1.1 in the studied temperature range, as
indicated by the slightly different slope in the T² plot of ⁷⁷K (see
Fig. 2). This anisotropy may come from an anisotropic susceptibility or
an anisotropic hyperfine coupling. As a local probe, the Knight shift
data should indicate an intrinsic behavior of the magnetic
susceptibility. In contrast, the magnetic susceptibility reported on
Tl_(0.58)Rb_(0.42)Fe_(1.72)Se₂ shows a T² behavior with H ∥ c, but not
with H ∥ ab [Refs. [38]], which may be affected by some unknown
contributions. Furthermore, the ratio ⁸⁷K/⁷⁷K ≈ 0.4 indicates that the
hyperfine field on the interlayer Rb site is comparable to that on the
Se site, implying a three-dimensional-like system.

Such a large increase of the Knight shift is unlikely caused by charge
excitations. In this compound, the charge excitation scenario will
require an increase of the electron density over a factor of three up to
the room temperature, which has not been indicated by any ARPES or
transport measurements. Spin fluctuations constitute another possible
scenario. The temperature behavior of the Knight shift suggest that a
finite spin gap (or pseudogap) may exist, so that the spin fluctuations
are suppressed at low temperatures and thermally activated at high
temperatures. However, the experimental evidence for the physical origin
of such a spin gap is lacking. Our evidence of nearly isotropic,
three-dimensional Knight shift should constitute important constraints
to possible theories.

We note that a magnetic transition at about 500 K has been reported by
recent neutron scattering[25] and susceptibility measurements[27] on
(Tl, A)${}_{\rm Fe2-x}$Se₂ superconductors. However, the long-range
antiferromagnetism has not been seen by NMR so far. It is possible that
the sample is phase separated with magnetic regions and nonmagnetic
regions at low temperatures. Further NMR measurements, in particular at
high temperatures, are needed to address this issue.

## VII Summary

To summarize, our ⁷⁷Se and ⁸⁷Rb Knight shifts of
Tl_(0.47)Rb_(0.34)Fe_(1.63)Se₂ show bulk evidence for singlet
superconductivity. However, the Hebel-Slichter coherence peak is not
seen in the spin-lattice relaxation rate at a very low in-plane field,
which suggests that the system is probably not a conventional s-wave
superconductor. In the normal state, evidence for low-energy spin
fluctuations is not observed close

Korringa relation.

to T_(c), which raises questions about the correlation between spin
fluctuations and the superconductivity. With increasing temperature,
however, the Knight shift increases substantially with a T² behavior up
to room temperature, which is in contrast to most iron pnictides. The
spin-lattice relaxation rate also shows a large increase with
temperature. The Knight shift and the spin-lattice relaxation may
suggest spin excitations with a finite gap (or pseudogap) which are
thermally excited at high temperatures.

Our resolved chemical composition of Tl_(0.47)Rb_(0.34)Fe_(1.63)Se₂
suggests that the A₂Fe₄Se₅ stoichiometric structure is formed in our
superconducting compound. Furthermore, the similar NMR data of
Tl_(0.47)Rb_(0.34)Fe_(1.63)Se₂ and K_(0.8)Fe_(2 − x)Se₂ indicates the
same electronic structure and pairing symmetry in both compounds, which
points to a common origin of superconductivity in this structure family
of the iron-based superconductors.
