###### Abstract

The introduction of impurities in superconducting materials is a well
known approach to test their stability for future technological
applications as well as to unravel their intrinsic microscopic
properties. In the cuprates the study of the staggered spin
configuration around isolated spinless impurities, as Zn, has allowed
one to determine how the electronic correlations evolve throughout the
phase diagram [1]. When a sizable amount of impurities is introduced
they can no longer be treated as independent local perturbations; the
correlation among the impurities themselves has to be considered and
quantum transitions to new phases may arise [2].

In iron-based superconductors several studies on the effect of
impurities have been carried out and it has soon emerged that the
behavior may vary a lot depending on the family considered. If one
concentrates on the LnFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(z) (Ln1111) family, with Ln a
lanthanide ion, one notices that spinless impurities introduced by
substituting Fe by Ru, cause a very weak effect both on the magnetic
(z = 0) [3, 4, 5, 6] and on the superconducting (z = 0.11) [7, 8, 9, 10,
11] ground state. One has to introduce almost 60

The nature of the magnetic ground state development at high Mn contents
is still controversial [15]. In Ba_(0.5)K_(0.5)(Fe_(1 − x)Mn_(x)As)₂
superconductors neutron scattering results suggested that Mn could
modify the magnetic wave vector from (π/a, 0) to (π/a, π/a) (square
lattice unit cell with Fe ions at the vertices) [16], leading to a
weakening of s_(x⁻)wave pairing [17]. However, the absence of single
crystals with a size appropriate for neutron scattering experiments
makes the determination of the magnetic correlations developing upon Mn
doping rather difficult for Ln1111 superconductors.

Since in Fe-based superconductors one of the most likely pairing
mechanisms involves magnetic excitations [18], it is of major importance
to investigate how the spin excitations evolve in optimally doped
LaFe_(1 − x)Mn_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) superconductors as the QCP is
approached. From ⁷⁵As nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T₁
measurements it was observed [14] that when T_(c) vanishes for
x_(c) ≃ 0.002 the spin correlations follow the behavior predicted for
strongly correlated electron systems close to a two-dimensional (2D)
antiferromagnetic QCP [19]. In this Rapid Communication it is shown that
upon increasing the chemical pressure, by partially substituting Y for
La, T_(c) decreases more slowly with x (Fig. 1), mimicking the effect
observed for Sm1111. This indicates that the different behavior of
Sm1111 and La1111 against Mn impurities has to be associated with the
larger chemical pressure induced by the lanthanide ions on the FeAs
planes in the former case. From ¹⁹F NMR 1/T₁ measurements it is shown
that besides the high frequency (10¹²-10¹³ s⁻¹) dynamics probed by ⁷⁵As
nuclei, an additional very low-frequency (megahertz range) dynamics
develops upon Mn doping and becomes progressively enhanced as the QCP is
approached. Furthermore, it is evidenced that if the system is driven
away from the QCP by partially substituting La with Y the low-frequency
dynamics becomes significantly enhanced only at high Mn contents where
T_(c) → 0. These results evidence that the disruption of the
superconducting phase coincides with the enhancement of low-frequency
fluctuations possibly competing with the ones driving the pairing.

NMR experiments were performed on (La,Y)
Fe_(1 − x)Mn_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) polycrystalline samples. Y for La
substitution allows one to vary the chemical pressure without
introducing paramagnetic lanthanide ions which would significantly
affect ¹⁹F NMR 1/T₁[20]. Two series of samples were studied: the first
one with no Y and with Mn contents of x = 0%, 0.025%, 0.075%, 0.1%, and
0.2% (referred to as LaYO), while the second one was studied with 20% of
yttrium (LaY20 hereafter) and Mn content x = 0%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 10%, and
20%. LaY0 and LaY20 samples were prepared as described in Refs. [13] and
[21], respectively. All the samples were optimally electron doped with
fluorine content around 11%[22]. T_(c) was determined by means of
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) zero-field-cooled
magnetization measurements in a 10 Oe magnetic field [21]. The diagram
of the superconducting phase, for both series of samples, as a function
of Mn content is shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the introduction of
20% of yttrium stabilizes the superconducting phase, leading to an
increase of T_(c) for x = 0[23] as well as to a marked increase of x_(c)
from 0.2% to about 4.5%.

¹⁹F NMR measurements were performed at low magnetic fields, H ≤ 1.5 T,
by using standard radio-frequency pulse sequences. The spin-lattice
relaxation rate was estimated by following the recovery of nuclear
magnetization M_(z)(τ) after a saturation recovery sequence. The
recovery was fit according to

M_(z)(τ) = M₀[1 − f e^(−(τ/T₁)t^(′))]
(1)

with M₀ the magnetization at equilibrium. The factor f ≃ 1 is introduced
to account for incomplete saturation and θ is a stretching exponent
which indicates a distribution of 1/T₁. The stretching exponent β was
found to be 1 for T > 80 K and decreased to about 0.5 at low T. The
distribution of relaxation rates originates from the presence of
different inequivalent Mn impurity configurations around ¹⁹F nuclei.

The T dependence of 1/T₁ for both sample series is shown in Fig. 2.
Below 70 K ¹⁹F NMR 1/T₁ is characterized by a progressive increase upon
decreasing T, by a pronounced maximum around 20 K, which can be either
below or above T_(c) depending on the Y and Mn content (see Fig. 1) and
eventually by a decrease at low T. Since, in all samples, the increase
starts well above T_(c) those peaks should not be associated with
dynamics which develop in the superconducting phase (e.g., vortex
motions) [24] but to normal state low-energy excitations. It should be
remarked that in the normal phase of Ln111 superconductors without
impurities no marked peak in 1/T₁ has ever been reported. Only peaks in
1/T₁T have been observed [25], corresponding to small bumps in 1/T₁.
Here it

nonsuperconducting samples. The dashed lines are fits of the data

is noticed that those peaks are significantly enhanced by the presence
of impurities suggesting that Mn tends to strengthen those low-frequency
dynamics which might already be present in pure compounds (see Fig. 2).

By performing 1/T₁ measurements at different magnetic fields one
observes that while the high T behavior is only weakly field dependent
the magnitude of the peak around 20 K grows by lowering the magnetic
field (Fig. 3). This is exactly the behavior expected in the presence of
dynamics approaching the nuclear Larmor frequency ω₀, namely, in the
megahertz range. If one assumes an exponential decay for the correlation
function describing the fluctuations with a characteristic time τ_(c),
then one has [26]

$$\frac{1}{T_{1}}=\gamma^{2}\langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle\frac{\tau_{c}}{1+\omega _{0}^{2}\tau_{c}^{2}},$$
(2)

where γ is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and ⟨h_(⊥)²⟩ the mean square
amplitude of the local field fluctuations perpendicular to Ĥ. In several
disordered systems, including cuprates [27], the T dependence of the
correlation time is well accounted for by an Arrhenius law
τ_(c)(T) = τ₀exp (E_(a)/k_(B)T) with E_(a) an energy barrier and τ₀ the
characteristic attempt time. Nevertheless, a monodisperse behavior
cannot suitably describe the broad peaks in 1/T₁ and one rather has to
consider a distribution of correlation times associated with the
nonuniform distribution of Mn impurities. This corresponds to a
distribution of energy barriers which, for simplicity, was taken as
squared with a width Δ centered around ⟨E_(a)⟩[28]. In order to account
for the high T behavior of 1/T₁ a linear Korringa term σ[29],
characteristic of metallic systems, was introduced (see Fig. 2). Then
1/T₁ can be described by the expression [28]

$$\frac{1}{T_{1}} = \frac{\gamma^{2}\langle h_{\perp}^{2}\rangle T}{2\omega_{0}\Delta} \big{[}a\tan\big{(}\omega_{0}\tau_{0}e^{\langle E_{a}\rangle+\Delta\rangle/T} \big{)}$$
(3)
$$-a\tan\big{(}\omega_{0}\tau_{0}e^{\langle E_{a}\rangle-\Delta \rangle/T}\big{)}\big{]}+\alpha T.$$

By fitting the data of the superconducting samples (x < 0.2

Moreover, one may notice (Fig. 2) that for x ≤ 0.5

The observation that the magnetic correlations become depressed when La
is substituted by a smaller lanthanide ion can in principle be
associated with a decrease of the ratio U/t between Coulomb repulsion
and hopping integral due to the increase in the chemical pressure.
However, for stripe collinear order [Q̃ = (π/a, 0) or (0, π/a)]
theoretical works [32,33]

Figure 3: (Color online) ¹⁹F NMR 1/T₁ in the x = 0.1

suggest that in Ln1111 the magnetic order parameter should become
enhanced on decreasing the Ln size or equivalently increasing the As z/c
coordinate, exactly the opposite of what is found here. It should also
be remarked that the behavior found upon Mn doping is contrary to that
observed in Ru-substituted Fe-based superconductors where the magnetic
order is stabilized by decreasing the size of the lanthanide [11].
Hence, it is likely that upon increasing x magnetic correlations
different from the stripe ones develop. Giovannetti _et al._[33] showed,
through Landau free energy calculations, that around optimal electron
doping the energy difference between the stripe and orthomagnetic phases
becomes reduced. Hence, it might be possible that the introduction of Mn
impurities could stabilize the latter type of order.

More recently Gastiasoro and Andersen [34] have considered the
cooperative behavior of paramagnetic impurities coupled via
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in the Fe-based
superconductors. They pointed out that upon increasing the Kondo-like
coupling between the localized impurity and the itinerant electrons,
Neel [Q̃ = (π/a, π/a)] correlations would arise and the amplitude of
collinear stripe modes decrease. However, even when the coupling becomes
significant and Neel fluctuations enhanced, stripe spin correlations
would still survive. In a real space description their results imply the
development of Neel-type correlations in small islands around the
impurity and stripe spin arrangement at larger distances from the
impurity. Even if from ¹⁹F NMR spectra we cannot check the validity of
this model, this theoretical approach is able to explain both the
weakening of the superconductivity [17] and the onset of a novel
magnetic phase upon Mn doping [14]. In such a scenario the peaks in 1/T₁
should be associated with the freezing of the spin fluctuations around
Mn impurities which get more and more correlated as the QCP is
approached. The theoretical model by Gastiasoro and Andersen [34] also
allows one to make an analogy between heavy fermion physics and that
achieved by doping Fe-based superconductor impurities. In this respect
we recall that, similarly to heavy fermions, at the QCP there is a
charge localization [13] suggesting a divergence of the electron
effective mass. Hence, one should actually consider two possible
concomitant effects which depress superconductivity: loss of spin
excitations causing the pairing and/or charge localization. Once more,
we remark that the behavior achieved by Mn doping is quite different
from that observed in Ln1111 superconductors doped with Ru spinless
impurities, where even at very high doping levels (≃50

An alternative explanation for the growth of low-frequency spin
fluctuations in Mn-doped Ln1111 relies on the presence of nematic
fluctuations. In this respect it is interesting to observe that even
nominally pure samples do show a small bump in 1/T₁[25,36,37] in the
same T range where the peak in ¹⁹F NMR 1/T₁ arises. The same
low-frequency dynamics was found to affect the NMR transverse relaxation
rate in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Rh_(x))₂As₂ and was tentatively associated with
nematic fluctuations [37], possibly involving charge stripes [36].
Although there is no neat evidence for the type of dynamics here, one
may be tempted to relate the energy barrier probed by 1/T₁ to the one
separating the degenerate nematic phases [38]. In this framework the
enhancement of the low-frequency dynamics could be associated with the
pinning of those fluctuations by impurities.

In conclusion, the increase in the chemical pressure driven by Y for La
substitution in La_(1 − y)Y_(y)Fe_(1 + x)Mn_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) is
found to lead to a less effective suppression of the superconducting
ground state by Mn doping. ¹⁹F NMR 1/T₁ measurements exhibit a low-T
peak which indicates the onset of very low-frequency dynamics with an
amplitude directly related to the proximity of the compound to the QCP
between superconducting and magnetic phases. Based on recent theoretical
works, this behavior could be ascribed to the enhancement of spin
correlations different from stripe ones, suggesting that T_(c) is
depressed by the decrease in the spin fluctuations around (π/a, 0),
which are widely believed to mediate the pairing, or by the localization
effect in the region close to the metal-insulator boundary.
