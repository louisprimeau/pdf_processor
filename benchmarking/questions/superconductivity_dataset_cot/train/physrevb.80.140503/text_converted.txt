###### Abstract

The thermal conductivity κ of the iron-arsenide superconductor
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂(T_(c)=30 K) was measured in single crystals at
temperatures down to T=50 mK(=T_(c)/600) and in magnetic fields up to H
=15 T(=H_(c2)/4). A negligible residual linear term in κ/T as T→0 shows
that there are no zero-energy quasiparticles in the superconducting
state. This rules out the existence of line and in-plane point nodes in
the superconducting gap, imposing strong constraints on the symmetry of
the order parameter. It excludes d-wave symmetry, drawing a clear
distinction between these superconductors and the high-T_(c) cuprates.
However, the fact that a magnetic field much smaller than H_(c2) can
induce a residual linear term indicates that the gap must be very small
on part of the Fermi surface, whether from strong anisotropy or band
dependence, or both.

Several experiments have been performed to address the symmetry of the
order parameter in iron-arsenide superconductors. Early studies on
mostly polycrystalline samples of RFeAs(O,F), where R=La, Nd, or Sm,
have led to indications that appear contradictory. While point-contact
spectroscopy,¹ angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),² and
penetration depth³ ⁻ ⁵ point to a full superconducting gap without
nodes, specific heat,⁶ and nuclear magnetic resonance⁷ data were
interpreted in terms of a nodal superconducting gap. Reports on single
crystals of doped BaFe₂As₂, also appear contradictory. In (Ba,K)Fe₂As₂,
ARPES studies have found an isotropic superconducting gap with a
magnitude of 12 meV on one Fermi surface and 6 meV on another,⁸ ⁻ ¹⁰
specific-heat measurements are broadly consistent with an s-wave gap of
6 meV,¹¹ as are muon measurements of the superfluid density.¹² By
contrast, penetration depth studies find a power-law variation,¹³ as in
Cooperdoped BaFe₂As₂,¹⁴ as opposed to the exponential temperature
dependence expected of an isotropic s-wave gap.

In an attempt to shed further light on the structure of the
superconducting gap, we have measured the thermal conductivity κ of
K-doped BaFe₂As₂. Heat transport is a powerful probe of symmetry-imposed
nodes in the superconducting gap.¹⁵ We find a negligible residual linear
term κ₀/T in κ/T as T→0, strong evidence that there are no nodes in the
gap of this superconductor. Indeed, a line of nodes would have given a
sizable and universal (i.e., impurity independent) κ₀/T,¹⁵ as in
cuprates,¹⁶ ruthenates,¹⁷ and some heavy-fermion superconductors.¹⁸
Given the large impurity scattering rate in our samples, point nodes
would also have given a sizable (albeit nonuniversal) κ₀/T (Ref.
15)–unless they happen to lie along the c axis, perpendicular to the
direction of heat flow in our measurements. However, a magnetic field H
applied along the c axis induces a finite κ₀/T even for H≪H_(c2). This
shows that the superconducting gap must be very small on some part of
the Fermi surface, either because of a pronounced anisotropy on one
Fermi surface (whereby the gap has a deep minimum in some direction) or
because of pronounced band dependence, causing one Fermi-surface sheet
to have a very small gap.

Single crystals of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ were grown from FeAs flux.¹⁹
The doping level of the two samples used in the present study, labeled A
and B, was determined from the c-axis lattice parameter, giving x=0.25
for sample A (T_(c) =26 K) and x=0.28 for sample B (T_(c)=30 K), both on
the underdoped side, i.e., below optimal doping (x=0.4).²⁰

Samples were cleaved into rectangular bars with typical size
1.5×0.3×0.05 mm³. Silver wires were attached to the samples with a
silver-based alloy, providing ultralow contact resistance of the order
of 100 μΩ. Thermal conductivity was measured along the [100] direction
in the tetragonal crystallographic plane in a standard one-heater-two
thermometer technique.²¹ The magnetic field H was applied along the
[001] tetragonal axis. All measurements were done on warming after
cooling in constant H from above T_(c) to ensure a homogeneous field
distribution in the sample. All aspects of the charge and heat transport
are qualitatively the same in both samples, with minor quantitative
differences. For simplicity, only the data for sample A are displayed
here. Whenever quoted, we provide quantitative values for both samples.

In Fig. 1, we show the electrical resistivity ρ(T) of sample A as a
function of temperature. Below ∼150 K, ρ(T) shows a notable downtum,
followed by a range where ρ(T) is well described either by a power-law
dependence, ρ(T)=ρ₀+AT^(n), with n between 1.6 to 1.8, or by
ρ(T)=ρ₀+AT^(n), below 70 K or so. Using the latter fit, we get ρ₀=47 μΩ
cm (sample A) and 28 μΩ cm (sample B). Since the same contacts are used
for electrical and thermal transport, this allows us to accurately
estimate the normal-state thermal conductivity κ_(N)/T in the T→0 limit,
via the Wiedemann-Franz law, κ_(N)/T =L₀/ρ₀ where
L₀=$\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\frac{(\ln 2)}{c}$², giving κ_(N)/T=520 μW/K² cm
(sample A) and 875 μW/K² cm (sample B).

_Residual linear term in zero magnetic field._ The thermal conductivity
κ(T) of sample A, measured for H=0, is shown in Fig. 2. The data are
plotted as κ/T vs T^(4.65). The linear fit displayed in Fig. 2 shows
that the data below 0.4 K are well described by the function
κ/T=a+bT^(a), with a = κ₀/T = 5 μW/K² cm and α=1.65. This same function
describes the data of sample B equally well, with a = κ₀/T = 7 μW/K² cm
and α=1.5. The first term is the residual linear term of interest
here.[15] The second term is due to phonons, which at low temperatures
are scattered by the sample boundaries. Although the latter term would
be expected to give κ_(p)∝T³, i.e., α=2, measurements on single crystals
with smooth surfaces rarely show this textbook behavior because of a
specular reflection off the surface, and in practice 1 <α< 2.[22, 23,
24]

The magnitude of the residual linear term extracted from the fits in
Fig. 2 is extremely small. In similar measurements on samples where no
residual linear term is expected, κ₀/T was indeed found to be zero,
within an error bar of ±5 μW/K² cm or so.[22, 25] Within those error
bars, our two samples of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ exhibit negligible
residual linear terms. Let us put these minute κ₀/T values into
perspective. Comparison with the normal-state conductivity, gives the
ratio (κ₀/T)/(κ_(N)/T)≈ 1

It is in principle possible for the superconducting gap in pnictides to
have point nodes as opposed to line nodes, one of the scenarios
suggested by penetration depth studies.[14] The zero-energy
quasiparticles associated with point nodes give a residual linear term
which grows with impurity scattering,[26] so that κ₀/T can become a
substantial fraction of κ_(N)/T.[26] Given ρ_(x) we can estimate the
normal-state impurity scattering rate Γ₀ roughly from the plasma
frequency ω_(p)=c/λ₀, where λ₀ is the penetration depth, approximately
equal to 200 nm.[14] This gives ℏΓ₀/k_(B)T_(c)= 1.7 and 0.9 for samples
A and B, respectively. This is very substantial, and would give a large
residual linear term, comparable to the case of the line node. We
therefore conclude that point nodes in the gap of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂
are also unlikely, unless they are located along the c axis and do not
contribute to in-plane transport. Needless to say, our data also rule
out the possibility of an entirely gapless (or ungapped) Fermi surface,
proposed by some authors,[29] at least down to the 1

The nodes we have discussed so far are imposed by sym

metry, the result of a sign change in the order parameter around the
Fermi surface. Such symmetry-related nodes are broadened by impurity
scattering, giving rise to a sizable κ₀/T. The superconducting gap can
also go to zero in certain directions because of a pronounced anisotropy
that is not imposed by symmetry. However, such "accidental" nodes in a
gap with s-wave symmetry will be lifted by impurity scattering, making
the gap more isotropic.[30] Our zero-field data are consistent with an
s-wave gap, including one with strong anisotropy.

_Field dependence of thermal conductivity_. The effect of a magnetic
field H(H|c) on the thermal conductivity of Ba_(1 − x),K,Fe₂As₂ is
displayed in Fig. 3. In the panel on the left, κ/T curves are seen to
shift upwards almost rigidly with field. In the right panel, the value
of κ/T at three temperatures (T → 0, T =0.1 K, and T =0.15 K) is seen to
rise linearly with H up to our highest field of 15 T, which corresponds
roughly to H_(c2)/4 [using H_(c2) at T → 0 as approximately 65 T (Ref.
[31])]. In Fig. 4, we compare the field dependence of κ₀/T in
Ba_(1 − x),K_(x)Fe₂As₂ with the dependence in various other
superconductors, using normalized conductivity and field scales,
κ_(ν)/κ_(N) and H/H_(c2). In a d-wave superconductor like the overdoped
cuprate Tl-2201 (T_(c) = 15 K and H_(c2) ≃ 7 T), κ₀/T rises very steeply
at the lowest fields,[15; 21; 23] roughly as κ₀/T ∝ ⟨H̄, following the
density of delocalized zero-energy quasiparticles outside the vortex
cores,[3] By contrast, in an isotropic s-wave superconductor like Nb,
the rise in κ_(θ)/T is exponentially slow at low fields as it relies on
the tunneling of quasiparticles between localized states inside adjacent
vortex cores, which at low fields are far apart. In many materials,
however, the situation is not so clearcut. A good example is the
multiband superconductors MgB₂ (Ref. [34]) and NbSe₂.[25] Here the
magnitude of the s-wave superconducting gap is very different on two
sheets of the Fermi surface. In both materials, the small gap is roughly
one third of the large gap, so that a field H≃ H_(c2)/9 is sufficient to
kill superconductivity on the small-gap Fermi surface, which can then
contribute its full normal-state conductivity even deep inside the
vortex state. Specifically, at H=H_(c2)/5, κ₀/T is already half
(one-third) of κ_(N)/T in MgB₂(NbSe₂). It is one tenth in
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂. By comparison, κ₀/T is still negligible in a
single-gap superconductor such as pure Nb or disordered InBi (see Fig.
4). This shows that the superconducting gap must be small on some part
of the Fermi surface of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂, relative to the gap
maximum which controls H_(c2).

In Fig. 4, we show data for NbSe₂,[25] where we see that κ₀/T=0 at H=0
and κ₀/T rises linearly above H_(c2)/30, with a slope of 1.67 in the
normalized units of Fig. 4. In Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂, κ₀/T also rises
linearly, with a normalized slope of 0.46 in sample A and 0.21 in sample
B. In a multiband scenario, the magnitude of this slope is roughly
proportional to the value of the normal-state conductivity κ_(N)/T of
the small-gap Fermi surface relative to the overall conductivity. The
fact that the slope in absolute units is larger in sample A (3.7 μW/K²
cm T) than in sample B (2.8 μW/K² cm T) even though its total
normal-state conductivity κ_(N)/T  =  L₀/ρ₀ is _smaller_ (520 vs 875
μW/K² cm) is suggestive of a multiband situation with the impurity
scattering rate being different on different Fermi surfaces.

A recent heat transport study of the low-T_(c) nickel-arsenide
superconductor BaNi₂As₂(T_(c)=0.7 K) (Ref. [35]) gave κ₀/T =0, as here
in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (T_(c)=26−30 K). However, it found a much
slower increase of κ₀/T at low H/H_(c2), consistent with a gap that is
large everywhere on the Fermi surface. This suggests that a strong k
dependence of the gap may be important for achieving a high T_(c) value.

We conclude that there are no nodes in the superconducting gap of
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂, at least at x ≃ 0.25 − 0.28, with the possible
exception of point nodes along the c-axis. This excludes d-wave
symmetry, and any other symmetry that requires line nodes on the
multisheet Fermi surface of this superconductor. Symmetries consistent
with this constraint

include s-wave and s_(zz), whereby a full gap changes sign from the
electron Fermi surface to the hole Fermi surface.[36] From the rapid
rise of κ₀/T with magnetic field at very low fields, we infer that the
gap must be very small on some portion of the Fermi surface. This k
dependence of the gap magnitude can come from angle dependence or band
dependence, or both. In many experiments, the presence of a very small
gap could mimic that of a node.
