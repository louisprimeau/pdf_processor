###### Abstract

A low-temperature phase diagram _H_(_T_) of the 7.8-K superconductor HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (with an onset of 8.3 K) is generated through characterization of well-prepared samples by various experimental techniques including ac magnetic susceptibility, superconducting quantum interference device dc magnetic susceptibility, magnetic hysteresis, specific heat, and electrical resistivity measurements. The results yield a superconducting upper critical field _H__c_2(0) of 3.5 kG, a lower critical field _H__c_1(0) of 250 G, and a Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(k\) of 3.5. A nearly reentrant deep minimum at 5.2 K with very small _H__c_2 of 400 G and _H__c_1 of 5 G are observed. Two distinct magnetic transitions are observed with an incommensurate magnetic ordering temperature \(T_{m}\) of 5.7-6 K and an antiferromagnetic Neel temperature \(T_{N}\) of 5.2 K. The magnetic entropy _D_(\(S_{m}\) + \(S_{N}\)) estimated between 2 and 10 K is 10.4 J/mol K. The effective internal field which causes the nearly reentrant behavior is 2 kG at 5.2 K.

## I Introduction

Relatively high superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{c}\), up to 23 K have been reported in the quaternary borocarbide _R_T\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds (_R_ = Sc, Y, Th, U or a rare earth; T = Ni, Pd, or Pt).[1]\({}^{-}\)[11] The superconducting phase has been identified to be of the body-centered-tetragonal LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C type with space group \(I\)4/_mmm_. The structure is a three-dimensionally connected framework with LuC layers alternated with Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) layers, where nickel is tetrahedrally coordinated by four boron atoms.[4]

Among many nonmagnetic compounds in the Ni system, LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C exhibits the highest \(T_{c}\) of 16.6 K, followed by 15-16 K for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and metastable ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C,[1]\({}^{3-}\)[8] for ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C,[8] and no superconducting transition was found down to 2 K for LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.[8] Band-structure calculations on LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (Refs. 12, 13) indicate a high density of states _N_(\(E_{F}\)) at the Fermi level near the top of the almost-filled Ni(3_d_) band, with only modest admixture from B and C. All characteristics are indicative of a good, three-dimensional metal. A strong-coupled phonon mechanism for the occurrence of superconductivity is deduced with a very large electron-phonon coupling parameter \(l\), which is related to an unusual combination of electronic states at the Fermi level and a substantial contribution from the vibration of the light atoms.[12]

For compounds containing magnetic rare earth elements such as \(R\) = Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm, lower \(T_{c}\) values were observed due to the magnetic pair-breaking effect.[3] In fact, HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is the most intensively studied compound of the Ni-based system due to its nearly reentrant behavior around 5-6 K below the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) of 7.5-8 K.[6]\({}^{14-}\)[17] However, the reported magnetic transition temperatures are ill defined. For example, while yielding consistently an antiferromagnetic transition temperature \(T_{N}\) around 5 K,[15]\({}^{,}\)[16] two neutron diffraction measurements give two different incommensurately modulated/spiral magnetic transition temperatures \(T_{m}\) of 8 K (Ref. 15) and 6 K (Ref. 16), respectively. Meanwhile, prior specific-heat measurements show vaguely two shoulders around 5.5 and 6 K, in addition to a \(T_{N}\) of 5 K. The temperature dependence of superconducting upper critical field _H__c_2(_T_) is also ambiguous. The zero-temperature value _H__c_2(0) of 4.5 kG, a local minimum at 5.2 K, and a local maximum at 6.2 K were obtained from field-dependent electrical resistivity measurements[6] in contrast to 1.9 kG, 5-5.2 K, and 6 K, respectively, from magnetic measurements on a single crystal.[14]

In this work, we have characterized a well-prepared HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C polycrystalline sample through various experimental techniques including ac magnetic susceptibility, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) dc magnetic susceptibility, magnetic hysteresis, specific-heat, and electrical resistivity measurements. A phase diagram of this quaternary compound is thus generated with reference to the temperature dependence of critical magnetic fields.

## II Experiments

HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C samples were prepared from high-purity elements Ho (99.9%, ingot), Ni (99.9% foil), B (99.9995%, chips), and C (99.995% chips) with a stoichiometric ratio of (1:2:2:1) under an argon atmosphere in a Zr-gettered arc furnace. The Ho, B, and C ingredients were wrapped in the Ni foil and arc melted carefully several times to ensure negligible weight loss and sample homogeneity. The as-melted samples were then wrapped in Ta foils and annealed under argon atmosphere in a sealed quartz tube at 1100 degC for three days and then quenched in liquid nitrogen. Crystallographic data were obtained with a Rigaku Rotaflex 18-kW rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation with a scanning rate of 1deg in 2_th_ per min. A lazy pulverix PC program was employed for phase identification and lattice parameter calculation.

Electrical resistivity measurements (16 Hz) were carried out by the standard four-probe method in an RMC Cryosystems closed-cycle refrigerator down to 9 K and using single-shot cooling to 6.5 K. ac magnetic susceptibility measurements were made with a Lake Shore Model 7221 susceptometer/magnetometer down to 4.2 K in an ac magnetic field 0.1 or 0.01 G (rms) at 1 kHz. The ac signal can be biased by a dc magnetic field up to 1 T. dc magnetic susceptibility and magnetic hysteresis measurements were made with a Quantum Design MPMS or a Mu-metal shielded MPMS2 SQUID magnetometer down to 2 K in an applied field from 1 G to 1 T. Specific-heat measurements were made with an adiabatic calorimeter from 1.5 to 20 K. The sample was thermally anchored to a copper block containing a germanium thermometer and a manganin wire heater, for which measurements were made separately for addenda correction.

## III Results and discussion

In preparing HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C samples, a minute amount of Ni\({}_{2}\)B impurity often prevails,[18] which can actually serve as the flux in growing HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C single crystals.[14] For the annealed samples used in this work, the powder x-ray diffraction pattern in Fig. 1 reflects practically a single phase. The diffraction lines can be well indexed with the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type structure having tetragonal lattice parameters \(a\) = 3.516(3) A, \(c\) = 10.530(6) A, and unit cell volume \(V\) = 130.2(1) A3. The excellent sample quality is attributed to the use of Ni foil as the wrap of the high-purity starting materials, followed by liquid nitrogen quench after annealing.

### Superconducting and magnetic transitions

The low-temperature real and imaginary parts of ac magnetic susceptibilities \(\chi_{\rm ac}(T) = \chi^{\prime}(T) + i\chi^{\prime\prime}(T)\) of the annealed HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C bulk sample are shown together in Fig. 2, with 0.01 G (rms) ac field at 1 kHz frequency. Three phase transitions around 7.8, 5.7, and 5.2 K can be identified from the imaginary part. The first one at 7.8 K corresponds to a superconducting transition as the transition is accompanied by a diamagnetic, superconducting real part signal. This is consistent with the transport data in Fig. 3, where the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity \(\rho(T)\) shows a superconducting transition with 10% resistivity onset drop \(T_{c}\) (onset) of 8.3 K, 50% mid-point drop \(T_{c}\) (mid) of 8.1 K, and zero resistivity \(T_{c}\) (zero) of 7.8 K. The small extrapolated residual resistivity \(\rho(0\) K) of 24 \(\mu\Omega\) cm, along with the large metallic resistivity ratio \(\rho(RT)/\rho(9\) K) of 7.5, are indications of good polycrystalline sample quality. The \(T_{c} = 7.8\) K for

  HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is 8.8 K lower than the \(T_{c}\) = 16.6 K for nonmagnetic LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. Judging from the systematic variation of \(T_{c}\) with Ni-Ni in-plane distance \(d\) = _a /\(\sqrt{2}\)_ (_a_ is the tetragonal lattice parameter) for the nonmagnetic compounds RNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (_R_ = Sc, Lu, Y, Th, or La),[8] the \(T_{c}\) depression due to the magnetic pair-breaking effect at \(d\) = 2.468 A (for HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with \(a\) = 3.516 A) can be estimated as \(\Delta T_{c}\)(Ho) = \(T_{c}\)(Ho) - \(T_{c}\)(Ho) = 15.8 K -7.8 K = 8 K,[8] or about 90% of the observed \(T_{c}\) depression as compared with LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. If the magnetic pair-breaking effect is in the framework of the Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory with \(\Delta T_{c}\) proportional to the de Gennes factor (\(g_{J}-1)^{2}J(J+1)\), where \(J\) is the total angular momentum and \(g_{J}\) is the Lande \(g\)-factor,[19] then using \(\Delta T_{c}\)(Ho) = 8 K and the calculated Fermi-level density of states \(N\) (\(E_{F}\)) of 4.8 states/eV cell or 0.8 states/eV atom for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C,[13] a small exchange-coupling parameter \(|J|\) of 8.1 meV between conduction electron and localized 4\(f\) moment is derived by using the formula \(\Delta T_{c}\) = [\(\pi^{2}N(E_{F})/6\times 2k_{B}\)\(|J|^{2}(g_{J}-1)^{2}J(J+1)\). The tetragonal crystal-field effect (CEF) is neglected for the present crude estimation. The same \(T_{c}\)(_d_) curve with \(\Delta T_{c}\)/\(T_{c0}\) proportional to the de Gennes factor can also be used to predict the superconducting transition temperature of DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C using _T__c_0 (Dy) of 15.3 K at \(d\) = 2.498 A (for DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with \(a\) = 3.532 A).[8, 20] The calculated \(T_{c}\)(Dy) = 3.1 K is indeed close to \(T_{c}\) of 3.8 K observed in our preliminary study[20] and is higher than the previously reported \(T_{c}\) onset around 2 K.[6]

The two other transitions observed at 5.7 and 5.2 K from ac magnetic susceptibility data are apparently related to the long-range Ho\({}^{3+}\) magnetic ordering through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida indirect exchange interaction. The real part ac signal indicates a nearly reentrant behavior starting from the magnetic ordering temperature \(T_{m}\) around 5.7 K, reaching to a small positive peak at the antiferromagnetic Neel temperature \(T_{N}\) of 5.2 K, then dropping sharply back to diamagnetic signal below \(T_{N}\).[17] No nearly reentrant behavior can be detected from the resistivity measurement due to the low-temperature limit of 6.5 K. However, these two magnetic transitions can be clearly corroborated by low-temperature specific-heat data \(C\) (_T_) as shown in Fig. 4. Two distinct transition peaks were observed at 5.7 and 5.2 K, respectively. The expected specific-heat discontinuity at \(T_{c}\) would be of the order of mJ/mol K, and is too small to be observed in the presence of large magnetic contributions. Strictly speaking, there should be four contributions to the total heat capacity \(C\) = \(\gamma\) \(T\) + \(\beta\)_T_\({}^{3}\) + \(C_{m}\) + \(C_{N}\), corresponding to the electronic, the lattice, and the two magnetic transition components, respectively. By employing the literature data for nonmagnetic LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (Ref. [21]) as the base line representing the electronic and lattice terms, the magnetic entropy between 2 and 10 K can be derived as \(\Delta(S_{m}+S_{N})\) = \(\int\) ((_C_ - 0.019\(T\) - 0.00035\(T\)3)/_T_]_dT_ = 10.4 \(\rm{J/mol\,K}\). Additional contributions to the magnetic entropy below 2 K and above 10 K are relatively insignificant, judging from the data in Fig. 4. The small difference between 10.4 J/mol K and \(S_{N}\) = \(R\) ln3 = 9.12 J/mol K, which is expected for the antiferromagnetic ordering of Ho\({}^{3+}\) with a quasitriplet ground state (closely spaced doublet and singlet levels) in the tetragonal crystal field,[14] could simply be the consequence of the changeover from an antiferromagnetic state to the incommensurate modulated/spiral magnetic structure near \(T_{m}\). Such a transition should be considered as an order-to-order process with a latent heat. In fact, the minor peak at \(T_{m}\) = 5.7 K can easily account for such a \(\Delta S_{m}\) value. More importantly, the magnetic transition temperatures are consistent with the results of single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements,[16] where a simple commensurate antiferromagnetic structure was observed with moments aligned in the tetragonal basal plane around 5 K and an incommensurate modulated/spiral magnetic transition was developed around 6 K with the ferromagnetic planes rotating from layer to layer along the \(c\) axis with a turn angle of 165deg, and the neighboring moments along the \(a\) axis are rotated by approximately 104deg.[16] The persistence of the neutron satellite peaks up to 8 K from the powder neutron data may be due to the strong short-range magnetic fluctuation.[15]

Identical results are obtained from the low-field (1 G), zero-field-cooled (ZFC), and field-cooled (FC) dc mass magnetic susceptibilities \(\chi_{g}(T)\) as shown in Fig. 5. A powder sample with fine particle size of around 1 \(\mu\)m is used to avoid any unwanted shielding signal and the complex flux-pinning effect which are always observed for bulk borocarbide samples. The superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) of 7.8 K was observed from the merging point of the ZFC and FC curves, which is also the onset deviation from the Curie-Weiss law, with a large ZFC signal of \(-1.3\times 10^{-2}\) emu/g G and FC signal of \(-7.1\times 10^{-3}\) emu/g G at 2 K. Using x-ray density of 4.02 g/cm\({}^{3}\), volume susceptibility percentages 4\(\pi\chi\) of 66% (ZFC) and 36% (FC) at 2 K are obtained for the powder sample, indicating good sample quality. Nearly reentrant behavior is also observed with a \(T_{N}\) peak of 5.2 K and \(T_{m}\) upturn around 6 K. The large positive \(\chi_{g}\) value of \(3.3\times 10^{-3}\) emu/g G at 5.2 K is still smaller than \(4.1\times 10^{-3}\) emu/g G at \(T_{c}\) of 7.8 K.

### Superconducting upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\) and lower critical field \(H_{c1}(T)\)

Several methods are used to determine the superconducting upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\) and lower critical field \(H_{c1}(T)\).

The low-temperature ac magnetic susceptibility \(\chi_{\rm ac}(T)\) in ac field of 0.1 G (rms) at 1 kHz with a dc-biased magnetic field of 100 G is shown in Fig. 6. \(T_{c}\) decreases from 7.8 K in the zero-field-biased case to 7.5 K in the 100-G-biased case, or \(H_{c2}(7.5\) K)=100 G. \(T_{m}\) of 6 K and \(T_{N}\) of 5.2 K are observed. A small bump around 4.5 K was observed below \(T_{N}\). Judging from the shape of the real part signal, these magnetic structures under applied field may be slightly weakly ferromagnetic.

The field-dependent low-temperature ZFC dc mass magnetic susceptibilities \(\chi_{g}(T)\) in various applied fields of 100, 500, and 1 kG for bulk samples are shown collectively in Fig. 7. \(T_{c}\) decreases from 7.8 K in 1 G to 7.5 K in 100 G, 6.8 K in 500 G, and 6.5 K in 1 kG applied field. \(T_{m}\) and \(T_{N}\) are almost field independent in these low applied fields. The small bump observed in ac magnetic susceptibility is reflected as a knee at 4.5 K for \(\chi_{g}(T)\) in 100 G applied field. This bump is suppressed to 3.5 K in 500 G and is no longer observable in 1 kG. Superconductivity is completely destroyed in 5 kG as shown in Fig. 8, where only the two unchanged magnetic transitions of \(T_{m}\) and \(T_{N}\) remain.

Constant-temperature magnetic hysteresis measurements provide more precise information on the temperature dependence of superconducting upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\). As in Fig. 9, a \(H_{c2}(T)\) value of 3 kG for 2 K is determined from the merging point of the hysteresis curve as indicated by the arrow. Similarly, \(H_{c2}\) is 1 kG at 4 K. Moreover, each \(M(H)\) curve has a linear, nonhysteretic, paramagneticlike background due to simple commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with moments aligned in the tetragonal basal plane.[15, 16] The exchange interaction is ferromagnetic in the basal plane with weak antiferromagnetic coupling mediated through the Ni layers.

Figure 10 yields higher-temperature \(H_{c2}\) values of 400 G at 5.2 K (\(T_{N}\)) and 300 G at 7 K (\(>T_{m}\)). Finally, it is of particular interest to note that, more than the superconducting hysteretic behavior at 6 K (near \(T_{m}\)), a non

 linear magnetic background was present in Fig. 11. Meanwhile, a much enhanced \(H_{c2}\) of 2.2 kG was obtained at this temperature. This complex background is apparently due to the onset of the incommensurate modulated/spiral magnetic structure.

The temperature dependence of superconducting lower critical field \(H_{c1}(T)\) can also be determined from the magnetic hysteresis measurements as shown in Figs. 9\(-\)11. The \(H_{c1}(T)\) is defined as the deviation from linearity in the initial magnetization in each \(M(H)\) curve in Figs. 9\(-\)11. The values thus obtained are 10 G at 7 K, 20 G at 6 K, 5 G at 5.2 K, 50 G at 4 K, and 200 G at 2 K.

### Low-temperature phase diagram

Based on this work and the data analysis outlined above, the low-temperature phase diagram \(H(T)\) of HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is generated and given in Fig. 12. In terms of the temperature dependence of critical fields, the extrapolated \(H_{c2}(0)\) value is 3.5\(\pm\)0.5 kG while the extrapolated upper limit of \(H_{c1}(0)\) is 250\(\pm\)100 G. The previously reported \(H_{c2}(0)\) value of 1.9 kG from single-crystal magnetic data [14] is apparently too low since a \(H_{c2}(2\) K\()\) value of at least 3.0 kG was already observed experimentally from the hysteresis measurement. On the other hand, the \(H_{c2}(0)\) value of 3.5 kG is less than 4.5 kG reported from resistivity data where the \(H_{c2}\) values are arbitrarily defined as the midpoint resistivity drop [6]. The resistivity data may yield the surface critical field \(H_{c3}\), which is the limit of field in which superconductivity can persist at the surface of the sample [22], rather than \(H_{c2}\).

From \(H_{c1}(0)\) and \(H_{c2}(0)\), the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa\) value of 3.5 is evaluated using the formula \(H_{c2}/H_{c1}\)=2\(\kappa^{2}\)/(1m\(\kappa\)\(\cdot\)0.5) [23]. As a comparison, \(\kappa\) values of 12-15 are reported for nonmagnetic, higher-\(T_{c}\) YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C [24, 25]. From the local minimum of 400 G at \(T_{N}\) of 5.2 K and the shape of the \(H_{c2}(T)\) curve, a maximum effective internal field \(H_{\rm int}\) of 2 kG is deduced. The relatively slow recovery of \(H_{c2}(T)\) below \(T_{N}\) may be due to the incommensurate magnetic fluctuation where the neutron data indicate that the fluctuation is persisted down to lower temperatures [15, 16].

The phase diagram with two magnetic transitions below \(T_{c}\) reported for HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is indeed very similar to the previously reported pseudoternary Ho(Rh\({}_{1-\kappa}\)Ir\({}_{\kappa}\))\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\)

  system [26]\({}^{-}\)[28] with compositions around 0.25 \(<\) \(x\) \(<\) 0.5. For example, the Ho(Rh\({}_{0.7}\)Ir\({}_{0.3}\))\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) compound is superconducting at 5.5 K with two distinct magnetic transitions at 1.12 and 0.86 K from the specific-heat data. Nearly reentrant behavior is expected between these two magnetic transitions. True reentrant behavior was indeed observed for 0.075 \(<\) \(x\) \(<\) 0.25. For example, superconductivity of 5.2 K Ho(Rh\({}_{0.85}\)Ir\({}_{0.15}\))\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) was completely destroyed by a ferromagnetic ordering with Curie temperature \(T_{C}\) at 2.77 K.

## IV Conclusion

Well-prepared HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C samples were characterized by various experimental techniques including ac magnetic susceptibility, SQUID dc magnetic susceptibility, magnetic hysteresis, specific-heat, and electrical resistivity measurements. The results yield three distinct phase transitions: a superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) of 7.8 K (with onset of 8.3 K), and incommensurate magnetic ordering temperature \(T_{m}\) of 5.7\(-\)6 K, and an antiferromagnetic Neel temperature \(T_{N}\) of 5.2 K. Furthermore, a low-temperature phase diagram of this nearly reentrant magnetic superconductor is generated in terms of temperature dependence of \(H_{c1}\), \(H_{c2}\), \(T_{m}\), and \(T_{N}\). From the extrapolated \(H_{c1}\) (0) of 250\(\pm\)100 G and \(H_{c2}\)(0) of 3.5\(\pm\)0.5 kG, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa\) value of 3.5 is derived.
