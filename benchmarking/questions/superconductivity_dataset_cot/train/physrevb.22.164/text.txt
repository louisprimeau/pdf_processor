Much attention has been given to rare-earth (_R_) rhodium borides \(R\) Rh4B4 because of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.1 For example, the nonmagnetic YRh4B4 is superconducting below _Tc_ = 11.3 K, while GdRh4B4 and HoRh4B4 are ferromagnetic below \(T_{M}\) = 5.6 and 6.4 K, respectively. However, ErRh4B4 becomes superconducting at 8.7 K and returns to the normal state at the ferromagnetic transition at 0.9 K.1,2 The superconducting and ferromagnetic transition temperatures _Tc_ and \(T_{M}\) have been observed in such systems as Y1-xGdKRh4B4,3,4 Er1-xGdKRh4B4,5 Er1-xGdKRh4B4,5 and Eu1-xHoKRh4B4.

In this paper, we report that Er1-xTm_xRh4B4 provides another example in the series of compounds \(R\) Rh4B4. We have observed that the thulium ions act upon the superconducting transition magnetically and upon the magnetic transition of the erbium ions nonmagnetically. Our data are interpreted in terms of the crystalline field acting on non-Kramers Tm3+ ions. Our simple crystal-field model also explains the phase diagram for Er1-xHoKRh4B4 obtained by Johnston _et al._5 In particular, we have identified the minimum in the \(T_{M}\) vs \(x\) curve as the first observation of a "decoupled" ferromagnetic tetracritical point.

The dc susceptibility measurements.7,8 above 25 K indicated that the magnetic moment of a thulium ion in TmRh4B4 is very close to its free ion value. The lattice parameters9 of TmRh4B4 are quite similar to those of \(R\) Rh4B4, with \(R\) = Gd, Ho, and Er, and thus, it is believed that the thulium ions are trivalent in Er1-xTm_xRh4B4. Figure 1 shows the transition temperatures _Tc_ and \(T_{M}\) in Er1-xTm_xRh4B4 observed from ac susceptibility measurements. The _Tc_(_x_) is a linear function with _Tc_ = 8.7 K at \(x\) = 0 and _Tc_ = 9.6 K at \(x\) = 1, which is lower than the _Tc_ of nonmagnetic YRh4B4. Therefore, the thulium ions, believed to be in the singlet ground state, act on the superconducting transition as pair breakers.10,11 This is consistent with the dc susceptibility measurements.7 On the other hand, \(T_{M}\) decreases with increasing \(x\), and for \(x\) = 0.4, no re-entrance was observed down to 0.075 K. Thus, thulium ions appear to act on the

  magnetic transition as nonmagnetic ions. In order to explain these observations, we propose a simple crystalline-field model for the rare-earth ions in \(R\) Rh4B4.

Let us introduce the uniaxial crystal field due to the tetragonal structure of \(R\) Rh4B4 as

\[H = DJ_{2}^{2}\ \ .\]

where the tetragonal axis is taken to be the \(z\) axis. Here \(D\) is the crystal-field parameter of the rare-earth ion with angular momentum \(\overline{J}\). The higher-order terms of the crystal-field energy are neglected. The point-charge model12 gives the relation \(D = \alpha A\ \langle r^{2}\rangle\), where \(\alpha\) is the Stevens factor, \(A\) is a parameter that depends on the crystal structure, and \(\langle r^{2}\rangle\) is the averaged value of the 4\(f\) wave functions of the rare-earth ion. As mentioned above, the lattice parameters are almost independent of \(R\) in \(R\) Rh4B4 so that \(A\) may be taken to be a constant for these ions. Following the Hartree-Fock calculation by Freeman and Watson,13 the value of \(\langle r^{2}\rangle\) is almost constant among Er3+, Ho3+, and Tm3+ ions, and the values of \(\alpha\) are12 + 2.54 x 10-3, - 2.22 x 10-3, and + 1.01 x 10-2, respectively. Therefore, the sign of \(D\) of Er3+ ions is positive (the sign of \(A\) is positive). This is consistent with the neutron scattering result2 which revealed that the ferromagnetic moment of ErRh4B4 is perpendicular to the tetragonal axis.

To determine the value of \(D\) for Er3+ ions in \(R\) Rh4B4, we have employed the magnetic part of the specific heat14,15 in Er1-xGd4Rh4B4 (\(x = 0\), 0.09, and 0.28) which has a broad peak around 10 K that we identify as the Schottky peak arising from the crystalline-field splitting. By comparing Eq. (1) with the heat-capacity peaks in Refs. 14 and 15 we have found that the value of \(D\) of Er3+ ions in \(R\) Rh4B4 to be ~ 5 K. As discussed above, the sign of the Stevens factor \(\alpha\), and hence \(D\), of Ho3+ ions is opposite to that of Er3+ ions. Therefore, the direction of the magnetization in ferromagnetic HoRh4B4 will be in the tetragonal direction16 and as a result, the direction for Er1-xHo4Rh4B4 will depend on \(x\). Thus, it is interesting to examine the magnetic phase diagram of these compounds.

Let us consider the magnetic phase diagrams of a mixture of two rare-earth elements of types 1 and 2. In this case the magnetic Hamiltonian in the virtual-crystal approximation17 is appropriate; it can be written as

\[H = (1 - x)\sum\limits_{i}D_{1}J_{2i}^{2} - (1 - x)^{2}\sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j}J_{11}(ij)\overline{J}_{1i}\cdot \overline{J}_{1j} + x\sum\limits_{i}D_{2}J_{2i}^{2} - x^{2}\sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j}J_{22}(ij)\overline{J}_{2j}\cdot \overline{J}_{2j}\] (2) \[- x\,(1 - x)\sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j}2J_{12}(ij)\overline{J}_{1i}\cdot \overline{J}_{2j}\ \ .\]

where \(x\) is the concentration of the element 2, \(D_{i}\) is the crystalline-field parameter of the element \(l(l=1,2)\), and \(J_{2i}(ij)\) is the exchange interaction between the angular momenta \(\overline{J}_{\mu}\) at the \(i\) th site and \(\overline{J}_{\mu}\) at the \(j\)th site. We use the molecular-field theory to calculate the magnetic phase diagram. The molecular fields acting on elements 1 and 2 are then

\[\begin{array}{l}\overline{H}_{1} = (1 - x)\overline{J}_{11}(\overline{J}_{1}) + x\overline{J}_{12}(\overline{J}_{2})\ \ \ ,\\ \overline{H}_{2} = (1 - x)\overline{J}_{12}(\overline{J}_{1}) + x\overline{J}_{22}(\overline{J}_{2})\ \ \ ,\end{array}\]

respectively, with

\[\overline{J}_{\mu} = \sum\limits_{j}2J_{\mu}(ij)\ \ .\]

The magnetic transition temperature for a second-order phase transition is obtained from the condition that the equations

\[\langle\overline{J}_{1}\rangle = \overline{H}_{1}x\overline{J},\ \ \langle\overline{J}_{2}\rangle = \overline{H}_{2}x\overline{J}\ \ ,\]

have nontrivial solutions. Here, \(x\overline{J}\) is the paramagnetic susceptibility tensor of element / in the absence of the exchange interaction. We assume the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism for the exchange interaction between magnetic ions. One exchange constant is determined from \(T_{M}\) in HoRh4B4; this is the interaction between holmium ions. The remaining exchange constants are obtained by scaling the de Gennes factors as

\[\overline{J}_{11} : \overline{J}_{12} : \overline{J}_{22} = (g_{1} - 1)^{2} : (g_{1} - 1)(g_{2} - 1)^{2}\ \ ,\]

where \(g_{l}\) is the Lande \(g\) factor of element \(l\). The calculated phase diagram for Er1-xHo4Rh4B4 is given by the solid lines in the lower part of Fig. 2. In obtaining these, we have used \(D\,(\mathrm{Er}) = 5\) K, \(D\,(\mathrm{Ho}) = - 5\) K, and \(\overline{J}\,(\mathrm{Ho}\cdot\mathrm{Ho}) = 0.1\) K. In the figure, the solid boundary lines correspond to ordering of only one spin component and they intersect at an angle at the "decoupled" tetracritical point18,19: The ferromagnetic moments in phases \(A\) and \(B\) are then, respectively, parallel to and perpendicular to the tetragonal axis. Phase \(C\) is the oblique ferromagnetic phase. The minimum \(T_{M}\) in the \(T_{M}\) vs \(x\) curve is thus the first identification of a "decoupled" tetracritical point at which four ferromagnetic transitions occur. Recent specific-heat data20 show that in Er0.3Ho0.7Rh4B4 there appears a peak of the specific heat in the ferromagnetic state, which is consistent with the boundary between \(A\) and \(C\) phases. Here we have not included  the effects of superconductivity in phase \(D\) in the calculation.

Recently, it has been shown [21, 20] that the superconducting-to-ferromagnetic transition is slightly first order. However, in view of the fact that the crystalline fields strongly affect the magnetic transition and in spite of the simplicity of the model used in the calculations of the \(T_{M}\) vs \(x\) curves in Fig. 2, the agreement between theory and experiment [5] is satisfactory. This calculation also suggests that the exchange interaction is predominantly due to the RKKY mechanism. By employing the above results, we can also conclude that \(T_{M}\) in Er\({}_{1-x}\)Gd\({}_{x}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) is a linear function of \(x\), as observed experimentally [3], because the gadolinium ions are \(S\)-state ions so that the ferromagnetic moment is perpendicular to the tetragonal axis for all values of \(x\).

We have also calculated \(T_{c}(x)\) of Er\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) in Fig. 2 using Eqs. (3.17) and (3.18) from Ref. 10, the virtual-crystal molecular-field approximation for the spin system, and the following additional parameters using the notations of Ref. 10. The parameters for superconducting electrons are \(T_{c0}\) = 11.3 K, \(g_{\rm BCS}N(0)\) = 0.3, and \(l^{2}N(0)/k_{B}\) = 0.16 K. The measure of the range of the exchange interaction is

\[4k\bar{\jmath}D/k_{B} = 10.0[(1-x)(g_{1}-1)^{2}J_{1}(J_{1}+1)+x(g_{2}-1)^{2}J_{2}(J_{2}+1)]\] \[\times [(1-x)^{2}(g_{1}-1  tetragonal lattice by a bcc lattice with nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, the lower theoretical curve in Fig. 1 is found. The parameter values used in calculating \(T_{M}\) gives the value \(l^{2}N\left(0\right)/k_{B}\approx 1.6\) K for the RKKY interaction. On the other hand, the value of \(\beta\) in Eq. (8) for \(T_{c}\) gives the value \(l^{2}N\left(0\right)/k_{B}=0.21\) K. The large difference between these two values of \(l^{2}N\left(0\right)\) suggests that the electrons which contribute to the RKKY interaction are different from those for superconductivity [25, 10]. We note that irrespective of the RKKY mechanism, the model of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction explains the critical concentration \(x_{cr}\). This is because the long-ranged part of the RKKY [26, 27], as well as the dipole interactions [27, 28], are suppressed in the superconducting state.

Finally the broad shoulder of the specific heat above the superconducting-to-ferromagnetic transition in ErRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) observed by MacKay _et al._[20] has been attributed to the fluctuations of the spiral spin structure induced by superconductivity [28]. However, the shoulder does not occur in the alloys Er\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) (Ref. [20]) and Er\({}_{1-x}\)Gd\({}_{x}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) (Ref. [15]) with \(x\neq 0\). In general, the spiral structure is more stable in systems with the easy _plane_ crystal field than in those with the easy _axis_ crystal field. Therefore, we ascribe the absence of the broad specific-heat shoulder in the pseudoternaries to the fact that the uniaxial crystal field of Ho\({}^{3+}\) ions depresses the fluctuations of the spiral spin structure.
