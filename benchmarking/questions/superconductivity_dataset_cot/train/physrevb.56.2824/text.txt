###### Abstract

Equal amounts of Ca and Th have been doped into the Nd1-2xCa\({}_{x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) superconductor with \(x\) = 0, 0.015, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10. This causes a fast and linear decrease of the superconducting transition temperature, _T\({}_{c}\)_. A single orthorhombic phase was observed with x-ray diffraction except for weak additional lines for the \(x\) = 0.10 sample, suggesting a solubility limit below \(x\) = 0.10. Neutron-diffraction measurements were performed and bond valence sums (BVS's) were calculated. The results showed a small increase in the Cu2-O4 distance and a nearly constant Cu2 valence. The total hole density in the plane, _V\({}_{-}\)_ as defined by Tallon, remains almost constant with doping in contrast to the decrease observed for Ca-Pr doping. Other results from the BVS calculations also indicate differences between Ca-Th and Ca-Pr doping in the NdBa2Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) compound. [S0163-1829(97)01829-8]

## 1 Introduction

Four-valent Th does not easily enter into the rare-earth position of the RE-123 superconductors. However, when co-substituting Th with an equal amount of two-valent Ca, it was found that orthorhombic Y1-2xCa\({}_{x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) could be obtained up to a solubility limit of about \(x\) = 0.10.1 The changes of the lattice parameters and of the oxygen occupation were negligible,2 thus suggesting a conserved hole concentration. Since Ca and Th are not expected to be magnetic and the distortion of the lattice is minimal, the strong linear decrease of the critical temperature, _T\({}_{c}\)_ of3 \(-\,dT_{c}\)/_dx_ = 180 K is surprising. This suppression of _T\({}_{c}\)_ is even larger than in similarly charge neutrally Ca-Pr doped Y-123, where \(-\,dT_{c}\)/_dx_ = 97 K.4 The linear decrease of _T\({}_{c}\)_ in this case has been assumed to arise from magnetic pair breaking or hole localization.4,5 Another suggestion involves interatomic distances and corresponding charge transfers as inferred in Ca-Pr doped Nd-123 from neutron-diffraction experiments and bond valence sum (BVS) calculations.6 It has also been found that the linear depression rate of _T\({}_{c}\)_ in Ca-Pr doped 123 increases with the ionic radius of the host,7 and in Nd-123 the large value of \(-\,dT_{c}\)/_dx_ = 206 K was observed.6

Structure refinements were performed with the Rietveld method [9] using the fullprof program [10] and the orthorhombic space group _Pmmm_. Anisotropic displacement parameters at the Cu-O chain sites led to better refinements. The displacement parameters at the oxygen vacant, O5, site were set to the same values as those at the O1 site except for a switch between the basal plane axial \(x\) and \(y\) directions. At all other sites isotropic displacement parameters were used. Most atomic positions were considered to be fully occupied, with three exceptions: (1) the Nd site where the occupation factors were refined with the condition that the doping ratios were correct, (2) the chain oxygen O1, and (3) O5 positions to register any oxygen disorder and to determine the oxygen concentration. A unit cell is shown in Fig. 1 for easy reference to structural notations. A neutron-diffraction pattern for Nd\({}_{0.9}\)Ca\({}_{0.05}\)Th\({}_{0.05}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) is shown in Fig. 2 as an example.

### Bond valence sum calculations

The method used for bond valence sum (BVS) calculations was similar to that described in some detail previously. [6] Therefore, only a few details are mentioned below. The atomic valence of an atom is assumed to be distributed between the bonds that it forms. BVS for atom \(i\) is then \(V_{i}\!=\!\Sigma_{s}\!=\!\Sigma\,\exp[(R_{0}\!-\!R_{ij})/0.37]\) where \(s_{j}\) is the valence of one bond, and the sum is over all neighbors \(j\). The constant 0.37 was empirically determined. [11]\(R_{0}\) represents the length of a bond of unit valence, [11] and \(R_{ij}\) is the experimentally determined distance between atoms \(i\) and \(j\). \(R_{0}\) was taken to be 1.600, 1.679, and 1.730 A for Cu\({}^{1+}\), Cu\({}^{2+}\), and Cu\({}^{3+}\), respectively. [12, 13]\(R_{0}\) for the other atoms were taken from Brown and Altermatt, [11] except for Pr\({}^{4+}\) and Th\({}^{4+}\), for which \(R_{0}\) was calculated to be 2.154 and 2.070 A, respectively, with the same method as in Ref. [11]. The copper BVS was calculated using the formulas suggested by Tallon, [12] and the BVS for Pr as described in Ref. [6].

BVS for oxygen was obtained by taking into account the valence of Cu and Pr. [6] The hole density in the plane (\(V_{-}\!=\!2+V_{\text{Ca}2}\!-V_{\text{O}2}\!-V_{\text{O}3}\)) and the preference for distribution of holes at oxygen sites (\(V_{+}\!=\!6-V_{\text{Cu}2}\!-V_{\text{O}2}\!-V_{\text{O}3}\)) as suggested by Tallon [12] were also calculated.

## III Results and discussion

### Electrical resistivity

The normalized electrical resistivity vs temperature, shown in Fig. 3, was found to be linear for all doping levels. The superconducting transition widths, from 90 to 10 % of the resistance drop, were 1.1, 1.4, 2.6, 6.2, and 9.8 K for \(x\!=\!0\), 0.015, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10, respectively. For the sample with \(x\!=\!0.10\) a double transition was observed suggesting a solubility limit below \(x\!=\!0.10\). Increased doping concentration resulted in a strong increase of the resistivity and a decrease in the temperature coefficient of resistance, as shown in Fig. 4, which suggests a weakening of the metallic state with increasing Ca-Th concentration. In both cases the

The difference between calculated and observed intensities are shown below the main panel (with the same ordinate scale as in the main panel).

  10% sample showed small deviations from the trends of the samples with less doping, again pointing to a solubility limit slightly below \(x\!=\!0.10\).

\(T_{c}\) vs concentration is shown in Fig. 5. A linear relation between \(T_{c}\) and doping is well obeyed in the orthorhombic phase, and the depression rate is \(-dT_{c}/dx\!=\!232\) K. This is apparently the strongest suppression rate observed in charge neutrally doped 123 compounds.

### X-ray diffraction

X-ray powder diffraction was used mainly as a convenient way to characterize the samples and to ascertain a single orthorhombic phase in the sensitive technique used. All samples showed reflections from orthorhombic 123 and they were single phase at our low doping levels with the exception of the \(x\!=\!0.10\) sample. The latter showed very weak impurity reflections supporting a solubility limit slightly below \(x\!=\!0.10\). Th was earlier found not to substitute Y in 123 compounds unless codoped with Ca, and the solubility limit in this case was also around 10%.[1]

### Neutron-diffraction results

Results from Rietveld refinements of diffraction data are given for all samples in Table 1. Compared to earlier measurements,[2, 6] the improvements of the experimental technique have led to a higher neutron count even with reduced measuring time, to smaller background at low \(\theta\) values, and to quite small \(R\) values of the refinements, particularly considering the high absorption of neutrons by Nd atoms. These results therefore indicate a good quality of the data.

The results for the pure Nd sample agree with earlier results.[6, 14] Structural changes with Ca-Th doping are rather small, and in general smaller than for Y\({}_{1-2x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\)[2] An exception is the large decrease of the \(c\)-axis length with doping in Nd-123, shown in Fig. 6, in contrast to the rather constant \(c\)-axis length in Y-123.[2] This is not surprising since the radius of Nd is almost as large as that of Ca, while Th is about 5% smaller and Y about 10% smaller than Ca.[15] Together with a small decrease of the \(b\) axis this gives a decreasing cell volume. The increase of the \(a\) axis and the decrease of the \(b\)-axis cause the orthorhombicity to decrease slightly as can be seen in the inset of Fig. 6. This is accompanied by a small increase in the O5 occupancy, pointing to an increased disorder in the Cu-O chains with increasing Ca-Th content as has also been seen in the Y\({}_{1-2x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\)[2] The total oxygen occupation is constant within the measurement accuracy, indicating, as does the small changes in structure, that the hole concentration is fairly constant.

The sensitivity of superconducting properties to small changes in the Cu1-O4 distance has been noticed by several authors and considered to be important for the charge transfer from the Cu-O chains to the planes. As can be seen in the top panel of Fig. 7 the Cu1-O4 distance stays fairly constant with doping. The small increase in this distance inferred previously[2] for Ca-Th doping in Y-123 is within the present experimental uncertainty. For Y\({}_{1-2x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) the Cu1-O4 distance increased slightly with \(x\),[16] and in the case of Nd\({}_{1-2x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) the dominating trend was a decrease with \(x\) of the Cu1-O4 distance.[6] Variations in the Cu1-O4 distance are thus apparently unrelated to the large effect on \(T_{c}\) in Nd\({}_{1-2x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\)

The Cu2-O4 distance, on the other hand, increases with doping with the exception of the 10% sample above the solubility limit. The present results are compared in the bottom panel of Fig. 7 with Ca-Th doping in Y-123 and Ca-Pr doping in Nd- and Y-123. The concentration dependence of the Cu2-O4 distance is similar in Ca-Th and Ca-Pr doped Nd-123. This conclusion is apparently valid also for the same dopings in Y-123, as illustrated in the upper part of the bottom panel in Fig. 7. From these observations it could be tempting to suggest that the Cu2-O4 bond length is related to the depression of \(T_{c}\).

### Bond valence sums

In order to estimate the effect of varying bond distances on the valences of the different atoms it is useful to calculate bond valence sums (BVS's). Although this method is empirical, it can nevertheless help to identify important trends when a series of related and similarly prepared samples are compared.

The result for the BVS is shown in Table 2 for the present Nd\({}_{1-2x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) samples. In Table 3 a similar calculation is given for Y\({}_{1-2x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) with dif

  fraction data from Ref. 2, to reach more firm conclusions on common and different trends when Ca-Th and Ca-Pr doping is compared.

It can first be noted that Cu2 has a near constant valence for Ca-Th doping in both Y and Nd hosts. The observation was also made for Ca-Pr doping in the same hosts,[6] and supports that charge neutral dopings are indeed obtained. The results are compared in Fig. 8, with Y-123 doped with Pr only, as calculated with the same methods as presently used,[6] and with structural data from Neumeier _et al._[17] In that case the Cu2 valence decreases with doping as expected for a Pr valence > 3.

The preference for holes to go to the oxygen atoms in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane, \(V_{+}\) , was linearly correlated by Tallon to the maximum attainable \(T_{c}\) in a particular alloy system.[12] He found an increase in \(T_{c}\) with an increase in \(V_{+}\) . With charge neutral dopings we expect the parabolic term in the relation between \(T_{c}\) and doping concentration to be reduced to a constant. In our case therefore, for each Ca concentration, \(T_{c}\) of the co-doped sample is close to the maximum \(T_{c}\) for that doping. However, the results in Tables 2 and 3 show a

The relative change in \(V_{+}\) vs \(T_{c}\) is of similar magnitude as for Ca-Pr doping,6 but the sign is opposite for Ca-Th doping.

Another interesting result is that the total hole density in the planes, \(V_{-}\) , stays almost constant with Ca-Th doping, or possibly increases somewhat. \(T_{c}\) vs \(V_{-}\) is compared in Fig. 9 with two charge doped systems; doping with Pr only in Y-123 and oxygen depletion, where \(V_{-}\) as expected decreases strongly with addition of Pr or removal of oxygen. The error bar for \(V_{-}\) at one point was estimated from allowing the atomic structure to vary within one standard deviation of the best result obtained from neutron diffraction. The \(x\!=\!0.1\) sample in Fig. 9 (open circle with the smallest \(T_{c}\)) which as mentioned is slightly above the solubility limit of the orthorhombic phase, displays an anomalously large \(V_{-}\) . This is consistent with some additional Ca in the 123 structure, beyond the maximum Th doping level.

The inset of Fig. 9 illustrates that \(V_{-}\) for Ca-Th doping also behaves differently than for Ca-Pr doping in 123 compounds. Although the errors are here somewhat larger, \(V_{-}\) clearly decreases with Ca-Pr doping, albeit more slowly than for charge doped systems.

One can also note from Tables 2 and 3 that \(V_{-}\) for the pure Y compound is larger than for Nd-123 by about 0.06, which can be almost entirely accounted for by the larger Cu2 valence. Such an increase in Cu2 valence with decreasing size of the Y-site ion has been observed previously for a series of RE-123 samples.19

## IV Summary and Discussion

### Main results for Ca-Th doped Nd-123

Sintered samples of Nd1-2xCaThBaCuO7-_d_ have studied by electrical resistance measurements and by x-ray and neutron diffraction. The solubility limit in the orthorhombic phase is slightly below \(x\) = 0.1 as inferred from x-ray diffraction, and transport properties in the superconducting and normal states. The structural changes with doping were small, with a small decrease of the _c_-axis length and cell volume. The oxygen concentration was almost constant with increased oxygen disorder and decreased orthorhombicity. The Cu1-O4 distance remained almost constant with doping, while the Cu2-O4 bond length displayed a small increase.

The superconducting critical temperature, \(T_{c}\), decreased linearly at the rate of -_d_ _T__c_/_dx_ of about 230 K. To our knowledge this strong effect is the largest depression rate observed in a charge neutrally doped high-temperature superconductor. It is an interesting problem to understand why Ca-Th doping has this detrimental effect on superconductivity.

### Differences and similarities between Ca-Th and Ca-Pr doping in 123

It is useful to summarize various properties of Ca-Th doped Nd-123 by comparing with Ca-Pr in the same host,[6] and with Ca-Th and Ca-Pr doping in Y-123.[2, 16] The linear depression of \(T_{c}\), the constant Cu2 valence, and the nearly constant oxygen level support a charge neutral doping in all four systems. Changes in structure and bond lengths as observed by neutron diffraction are small and sometimes of variable sign. The Cu1-O4 distance e.g., is within experimental uncertainty almost constant for Ca-Th doping, while it increases slightly for Ca-Pr in Y-123 and decreases for Ca-Pr in Nd-123. Therefore, it appears that there is no simple relation between \(T_{c}\) and this bond length.

An interesting common trend in a bond length change is the increase of the Cu2-O4 distance with doping in all four systems illustrated in Fig. 7. Presently available data do not allow for more detailed comparisons. It is interesting to note, however, that the smallest rate of increase of the Cu2-O4 bond length occurs for Ca-Pr doped Y-123,[20] which also has the smallest depression rate of \(T_{c}\) (-_d_ _T__c_/_dx_  100 K), while the stronger rate of increase of the Cu2-O4 bond length within the solubility limit in the two Nd-based systems and in the Y-Ca-Th system correspond to a depression rate about twice as large.

Closer inspection of the results show some differences between Ca-Th and Ca-Pr doping. When going from Ca-Th doped Y-123 to Nd-123, the depression rate increases by about 30%. For Ca-Pr doped compounds the corresponding increase of the depression rate is larger than a factor of 2, suggesting that the effect of the size of the Y-site ion on the depression rate is quite different for Ca-Th and Ca-Pr doping.

From the BVS results, _V_+ , measuring the tendency for holes on oxygen in the CuO2 planes, increases with decreasing \(T_{c}\) for Ca-Th doped samples. This is in contrast to Ca-Pr doped systems,[6] where instead _V_+ decreased with decreasing \(T_{c}\), as expected for optimally doped ceramic samples.[12] Furthermore, it was found previously that the hole density in the planes, _V_- , decreased with doping of Ca-Pr.[6] For Ca-Th doping in contrast _V_- remains almost constant. These trends in BVS results indicate interesting differences between Ca-Pr and Ca-Th doping in 123 hosts (Fig. 9). Apparently significant charge transfers, albeit small, occur, which cannot be easily resolved from studies of bond lengths only, but are clearly seen in BVS calculations.

One must ask what causes the strong depression of \(T_{c}\) in these samples? Ca-Th doping in 123 compounds is charge neutral, as for Ca-Pr doping, magnetic interactions do not seem likely, which is one suggestion for the \(T_{c}\) depression with Ca-Pr doping, and in contrast to Ca-Pr doping no significant depletion of charge appears in the CuO2 planes. Yet the depression of \(T_{c}\) is stronger for Ca-Th than for Ca-Pr doping.

It is interesting to observe that the increase of the resistivity at 275 K of Ca-Th doped Nd-123 for 0 <= \(x\) <= 0.05, shown in Fig. 4, is much stronger than for the corresponding Ca-Pr doped samples,[6] and the decrease of the temperature coefficient of resistance over the same concentration range is also considerably stronger. Both these changes are in the direction expected for weakening metallic properties due to electronic disorder, and a comparison between Fig. 4 and Ref. [6] thus suggests that such disorder effects are stronger when substituting with Ca-Th than with Ca-Pr. This possibility would seem to merit further investigations.
