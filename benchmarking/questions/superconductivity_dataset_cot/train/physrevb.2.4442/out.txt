###### Abstract

The superconducting transitions of ^{116}Cd, naturally occurring Cd, ^{114}Cd, and ^{116}Cd have been measured. The transition temperatures T_{\epsilon} were found to be 0.5218, 0.5173, 0.5148, and 0.5115 K, respectively, giving z=0.385\pm0.015 and \xi=0.23 as parameters in T_{\epsilon}\proptoM^{-z\omega}M^{-0.4(1-\mathrm{p})}. These results are compared with various theoretical predictions.

The discovery of the isotope effect in superconductors[1, 2] gave great impetus to the development of the microscopic theory by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS).[3] More recently, deviations from the BCS isotope effect, i.e., T_{\epsilon}\proptoM^{-1/2}, have been used to test the predictions of more complex theories of Swihart,[4] Morel and Anderson,[5] Garland,[6] and McMillan.[7] There exists reasonably good agreement between the work of Garland and of McMillan and recent experimental isotope-effect measurements on Zn,[8] Ga,[9] and Cd.[10] This paper presents new measurements on isotopes of Cd which agree qualitatively with the previous result[10] but are of higher precision.

## 1 Experimental

The apparatus and technique used were similar to those previously described.[8] The Cd samples, as received from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, were not of sufficient purity to give meaningful results. A multiple sublimation and distillation purification similar to that performed[8] on Zn was used. The samples were in the form of right circular cylinders \sim3.4 mm in diameter and > 25 mm long. Unlike the Zn, however, the samples were left in the Pyrex tubes following the final crystal growth. The tubes had been lightly coated with carbon so that the metal would not adhere to the glass and be strained during the cooldown. The tubes were open at one end to ensure good thermal contact of the samples with the liquid ^{4}He surrounding them. The reproducibility and sharpness of the transitions indicate sufficient lack of strain and adequate thermal equilibrium for these measurements.

The electrical residual-resistivity ratios of the samples were measured using a modification of the eddy-current-decay measuring circuit of LePage _et al.[11]_ The samples all had resistance ratios r=\rho(4 K)/\rho(300 K) < 2.6

\times10^{-5}, 1/r>38 000. The isotopic analyses and average atomic masses of the samples are given in Table 1.

The nominal 8.2-\Omega, \frac{1}{8}-W Allen Bradley resistor used as a thermometer was calibrated against the vapor pressure of ^{4}He using the T_{\mathrm{eq}}^{4}He scale.[12] Corrections were made for the ^{4}He impurity in the ^{2}He,[13] the thermomolecular pressure ratios,[14] and deviations from the Weber-Schmidt equation due to the use of stainless-steel tubing.[18] The calibration data were least squares fitted to the relation \ln_R_ = _A_/_T_ + B + C ln T with a standard deviation of <0.4 mK in every case.
