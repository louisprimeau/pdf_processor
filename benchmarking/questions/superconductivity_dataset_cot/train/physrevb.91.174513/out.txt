###### Abstract

Single crystals of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} and Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} were synthesized by solution growth, and the crystal structures and thermodynamic and transport properties of both compounds were studied. In the case of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}, a structural first-order transition at around 165 K is identified by single-crystal diffraction experiments, with clear signatures visible in resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat data. No superconducting transition for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} was observed down to 0.5 K. In contrast, no structural phase transition at high temperature was observed for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}; however, bulk superconductivity with a critical temperature, T_{c}\approx 1.7 K, was observed. The Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma and the Debye temperature (\Theta_{\rm D}) were found to be 9.41 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and 209 K, respectively, for Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, and 22 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and 196 K, respectively, for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}. Study of the specific heat in the superconducting state of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} suggests that Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} is a weakly coupled, BCS superconductor.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) are fascinating and closely linked collective phenomena. The CDW in low-dimensional materials was first proposed by Peierls [1, 2], who showed that a one-dimensional metal was unstable against a periodic lattice distortion, which creates an energy gap at the Fermi level. Superconductivity and CDW states were linked when Frohlich proposed a mechanism of superconductivity based on a sliding, incommensurate CDW [3]. Following the formulation of the BCS theory [4] of superconductivity, it was appreciated that the superconducting state and the CDW state are both results of electron-phonon coupling often with the CDW state competing with and ultimately replacing the superconducting state as electron-phonon coupling is increased. In some, relatively rare, compounds both transitions can be found upon cooling; more often, though, a CDW or some other type of structural phase transition removes density of states at the Fermi surface and thus suppresses or even precludes the formation of a superconducting state.

It is interesting to study the properties of the materials which manifest the coexistence of superconducting and CDW states, so as to gain a better understanding of how they compete with each other for the density of states as each opens a gap at the Fermi level [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The electrical transport properties of some ternary, metal-rich chalcogenides [16, 17, 18], A_{2}M_{3}X_{2} (A = Sn, Pb, In, Tl, and Bi; M = Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd; X = S and Se) have been reported by Natarajan and coworkers [19] with some members of this family showing superconductivity at low temperature [20, 21, 22]. Recently, Sakamoto and coworkers reported that parkerite-type Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2}[23] was a new superconducting compound (with a critical temperature, T_{c}, \sim 0.7 K) with a possible higher temperature CDW transition at T_{\rm CDW}\approx 250 K. Pressure studies on this compound [24] found that the resistivity anomaly at 250 K shifted to higher temperature with increasing pressure, which is unusual for a conventional CDW transition [25, 26, 27]. Given that isostructural Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} is reported to have a resistive anomaly near 160 K (having been measured down to 77 K) [19], measurements of single crystalline Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} to lower temperatures are called for.

Using solution growth out of a Rh-rich Rh-Bi-S melt [22], our initial growth attempts produced large grain, crystalline material that showed a clear resistivity feature near 160 K but also an apparent superconducting transition near 2 K. These results indicated that there may be some form of competition or interaction between structural phase transition and superconductivity in this ternary system. A powder x-ray diffraction measurement revealed the anticipated Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} phase, but also indicated the presence of a second phase.

In order to better understand the physics and chemistry of this part of the Bi-Rh-S system, in this paper we present details of the crystal growth of both Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} and a new phase: Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}, provide structural data, and present and analyze thermodynamic and transport data from each compound. Whereas Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} manifests a first-order, structural-phase transition near 160 K and does not superconduct for T>0.5 K, Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} manifests no signs of any phase transition for 2 K <T<300 K has a significantly larger electronic specific heat coefficient, \gamma, and manifests bulk superconductivity below 2 K. Instead of finding the coexistence of a structural phase transition and subsequent superconductivity in one compound we found two closely related compounds: one that manifests a structural phase transition near 160 K and has a relatively lower electronic specific heat at low temperatures and another that does not undergo a structural phase transition upon cooling, has a relatively larger electronic specific heat, and does become superconducting below 2 K.

## II Experimental Methods

Single crystals of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} and Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} were produced using solution growth techniques [22, 28, 29]. For Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, a mixture of elemental Rh, Bi, and S was placed in a 2-ml fritted  alumina crucible [30], with a molar ratio of Rh:Bi:S = 42.6:28.2:29.2, and sealed in a silica ampule under partial pressure of high-purity argon gas. The sealed ampule was heated to 1150 degC over 12 h and held there for 3 h. After that, it was cooled to 900 degC over 70 h and excess liquid was decanted using a centrifuge. For Bi2Rh3.S2, a molar ratio of Rh:Bi:S = 55:22.5:25 was used, heated, and cooled in a similar manner but slowly cooled to 775 degC before decanting.

Powder x-ray diffraction data were collected by using a Rigaku Miniflex II diffractometer at room temperature (Cu K_a_ radiation). Samples were prepared by grinding single crystals into powder and spreading them onto a thin-grease-layer-coated single-crystal Si, low-background puck. Powder x-ray diffraction data were analyzed using the GSAS [31,32] program.

Single-crystal diffraction data were measured using a Bruker Smart Apex CCD diffractometer [33] with Mo K_a_ radiation (l = 0.71073 A). Data were collected with mixed _o_/_ph_ scan modes and with an exposure time of 10 s per frame. The 2_th_ range covered from 6 deg to 64 deg. Intensities were extracted and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects with the SAINT program. Empirical absorption corrections [34] were accomplished with SADABS, which is based on modeling a transmission surface by spherical harmonics employing equivalent reflections with I > 3 _a_(I). Using the

Lattice parameters were refined using single-crystal diffraction data and are summarized in Table 1. Atomic coordinates and displacement parameters with fully site occupation for Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} and Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} are given in Table 2.

The ac resistivity (f = 17 Hz) was measured as a function of temperature by the standard four-probe method in a Quantum Design, physical property measurement system (PPMS) instrument. Depending on the sample size Pt or Au wires (with the diameter of 25 \mum or 12.7 \mum, respectively) were attached to the samples using Epotek-H20E silver epoxy or DuPont 4929N silver paint. The specific heat was measured by using the relaxation method in a PPMS. The ^{3}He option was used to obtain a measurements down to 0.4 K. The DC magnetization measurements were performed in a Quantum Design, magnetic property measurement system (MPMS).

## III Results

### Phases and structures

The room temperature powder x-ray diffraction pattern from ground, phase-pure, single crystals of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} are shown in Fig. 1. Single crystal x-ray diffraction used to refine the lattice parameter of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} with monoclinic C2/m symmetry, a = 11.291(3) A, b = 8.378(2) A, c = 7.942(4) A, and \beta = 133.286(2)^{\circ}. These crystallographic parameters are within three standard deviations from literature data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}[19, 36]. Also these lattice parameters were used to fit the powder x-ray diffraction data shown in Fig. 1. Resistivity data measured on Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} single crystals show only a single transition at \sim165 K (see Fig. 6 below), with no superconductivity being observed down to 0.5 K.

To understand the phase transition of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} at 165 K, a set of single-crystal x-ray diffraction intensity data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} was collected at low-temperature (LT), ca. 120 K. As shown in Fig. 2, extra diffraction spots, not belonging to the unit cell of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} at room-temperature [a = 11.291(3) A, b = 8.378(2) A, c = 7.943(4) A, \beta = 133.286(2)^{\circ}], were observed in the (h0l) zone prerecession image. However, all spots could be completely indexed by a larger monoclinic unit cell

Green circles in (a) denote reflections that can be indexed by the base cell [C2/m, a = 11.291(3) Å, b = 8.378(2) Å, c = 7.942(2) Å, \beta = 133.286(2)^{\circ}]; note that many reflections cannot be indexed. Yellow circles in (b) denote the reflections that can be indexed by the supercell [a = 11.542(2) Å, b = 8.341(2) Å, c = 17.768(4) Å, \beta = 107.614(2)^{\circ}].

  [C2/m, a = 11.542(2) A, b = 8.341(2) A, c = 17.768(4) A, b = 107.614(2)c], which is about three times larger than the unit cell at room temperature (RT), cf. Table 1. Comparison of the RT and LT structures of Bi2Rh3S2, shown in Fig. 3, indicate that the flat two-dimensional (2D) layers in the RT structure (parallel to _ab_ plane) are periodically puckered in the LT superstructure.

The x-ray powder diffraction pattern of a ground, phase-pure, single crystal of Bi2Rh3.5S2 is shown in Fig. 4. According to single-crystal x-ray diffraction analyses (Table 1), Bi2Rh3.5S2 also crystallizes in monoclinic symmetry C2/m [_a_ = 11.5212(3) A, b = 7.9408(2) A, c = 7.8730(3) A, and b = 128.033(2)c]. These lattice parameters were used to fit the powder x-ray diffraction data shown in Fig. 4. Figure 5 shows the structure of Bi2Rh3.5S2 viewed along the (010) direction. Compared to the RT structure of Bi2Rh3S2, Fig. 3(a), the 2D layers in Bi2Rh3.5S2 are extensively puckered or distorted in response to the insertion of additional Rh atoms into octahedral vacancies between adjacent layers. As will be discussed below, the low-temperature electronic specific heat of Bi2Rh3.5S2 is almost double that of Bi2Rh3S2, consist with superconductivity in the former but not the latter.

### Physical properties of Bi2Rh3S2

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity data from Bi2Rh3S2 (Fig. 6) show a sharp feature associated with a 165 K transition with no superconducting transition observed down to 0.5 K. This material shows clear in-plane anisotropy in resistivity. Figure 6 presents the data from two samples with current flowing along each of the edge directions indicated in the lower inset. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) values are found to be 53 and 15 in these two directions, suggesting that the in-plane scattering and/or the Fermi velocity is anisotropic. Above 170 K the resistivity increases monotonically with temperature, showing metallic behavior. Around 165 K a sudden increase or decrease of resistivity with decreasing temperature is observed in the two different, in-plane, current directions. Below 160 K, resistivity again shows metallic like behavior down to 0.5 K. The upper inset to Fig. 6 shows a 2-5 K thermal hysteresis observed in the resistivity jump near 165 K, suggesting a first-order phase transition, as confirmed by our single-crystal x-ray diffraction analyses. Whereas this behavior is typical for structural transition, it is less common for a CDW transition [7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 23], which is often second

  order and usually manifests an increase in resistivity due to a reduction of the density of states at the Fermi energy due to opening up of a gap in the electronic density of states at the Fermi surface. We did not observe T^{2} behavior of the resistivity down to our base temperature.

Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility \chi (T). Since the signal from one piece of single crystal is very low and in order to measure the magnetic susceptibility, we measured the magnetization of several single crystals encapsulated in a sample holder and subtract the background signal due to the sample holder. The negative value of the magnetic susceptibility indicates the overall diamagnetic behavior of this compound. This is due to the dominating contribution from core diamagnetism. By subtracting the core diamagnetic contribution [37,38] we can estimate the electronic contribution to the susceptibility. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of the electronic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility, after the diamagnetic correction [37,38] (\chi_{\rm core} = -17\times10^{-5} emu mol^{-1}). Susceptibility linearly decreases with the decreasing temperature down to 165 K and then shows dramatic change at 165 K. Given that both Pauli paramagnetic and Landau diamagnetic susceptibility are proportional to the density of state at the Fermi level D(\epsilon_{\rm F}), the change in \chi at 165 K is consistent with an increase in the density of state at the Fermi level D(\epsilon_{\rm F}). In a typical CDW material there is a reduction of the density of state at the Fermi energy due to opening up of a gap in the electronic density of states at the Fermi surface. An increase in density of state is not consistent with the CDW mechanism for structural phase transition. The low-temperature upturn (below 25 K) in the susceptibility is probably due to the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic impurities in the sample.

The temperature-dependent specific heat of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} (Fig. 8) shows a broadened latent heat feature, consistent with the first-order-like features seen in the resistivity and magnetization data shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The room-temperature specific heat of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, 172.6 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}, is close to the Dulong-Petit limit, C_{V} = 3n R = 174.6 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}. The Sommerfeld coefficient, \gamma = 9.41 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and \beta = 1.49 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4} values were obtained for the LT phase from the low-temperature data fitted with C_{p}/T = \gamma + \betaT^{2}, as shown in the lower inset of Fig. 8. From \beta we obtained a Debye temperature (\Theta_{\rm D}) of 209 K by using Eq. (1) and slightly larger than the value of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2}. This reflects a higher phonon density of states at low energies, which are likely due to the presence of the lighter element "Sulfur" compared to "Selenium." A similar value of \gamma = 9.5 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} was

  obtained in isostructural Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2} compound [23]:

\[\Theta_{\rm D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{2}nR}{5\beta}\right)^{1/3}.\] (1)

With our measurements of single-crystal diffraction, resistivity, magnetization, and the specific heat, we can conclude the phase transition in Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} at 165 K is a first-order structural phase transition. We do not have clear evidence of a CDW being associated with this transition.

In the case of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2}, based on the results of the resistivity, magnetization, thermoelectric power, thermal expansion, and low-temperature x-ray measurements, Sakamoto _et al._[23] conclude that the anomaly at \sim250 K is a CDW transition. However, Chen _et al._[24] report that, based on their experiments of pressure and selected-area electron diffraction study, phase transition at \sim250 K is not a CDW transition, rather a structural transition. In the present case of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, further advanced measurements would be needed to find any support for a possible CDW.

### Physical properties of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}

Figure 9 presents the temperature dependence of resistivity of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}, which, unlike Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, does not show any transitions in the resistivity data around 165 K. However, it does manifest zero resistivity below 2 K, indicating an onset of a superconducting transition at this temperature. RRR of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} is 6.4, less than the RRR of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}. We did not observe T^{2} behavior in resistivity down to the base temperature of our measurement.

Figure 10 shows the low temperature specific heat data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}. The open red squares represent zero-field measurements, whereas the open black circles represent measurements under 1 T magnetic field, i.e., H\geqslant H_{c2}(T) for the measured temperature range (see below). From the low-temperature data fitted with C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2} from 2 to 3.8 K, as shown in the upper inset of Fig. 10, we find \gamma= 22 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and \beta= 1.94 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4} and can infer that \Theta_{\rm D} = 196 K. We can clearly see that \gamma of the superconducting Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} is twice as large as that for the nonsuperconducting Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} or Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2}[23]. Also, this value is larger than the other reported parkerite-type superconductors, Bi_{2}Ni_{3}S_{2}[20], Bi_{2}Ni_{3}Se_{2}[20], and Bi_{2}Pd_{3}Se_{2}[21].

On one hand, T_{c}=1.7 K was obtained by using an equal entropy construction to the low-temperature specific-heat data. On the other hand, the H=0C_{p}(T) data start to separate from the H=1 T C_{p}(T) data below 2.2 K. Specific-heat jump of \Delta C=52.4 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-1} gives \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}=1.39, which is close to the BCS value 1.43 for a weak-coupling superconductor. The green-colored solid line represents a BCS [4; 39] calculation. The deviation above 4 K, normal-state data from the simple Debye model indicates the presence of at least a T^{5} term in the lattice contribution.

The lower inset of Fig. 10 shows zero-field-cooled (ZFC) data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}. We were not able to see the full transition in ZFC measurements because the minimum temperature that we can reach in the MPMS is 1.8 K. These data are consistent with the broadened transition seen in the resistivity and the C_{p}(T) data.

The upper inset of Fig. 9 shows the field dependence of the superconducting transition for temperatures from 0.4 to 0.8 K and the lower inset shows the temperature dependence of the superconducting transition from 0 to 0.96 T applied field. Figure 11 shows \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) as a function of the critical temperature determined from the resistivity data. Lower and upper insets show the maximum slope of the resistivity extrapolated to \rho=0, used as a criteria to obtain the \mu_{0}H_{c2} and T_{c}, respectively. We can estimate the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length [39] at zero temperature, \xi(0)=150

Lower inset shows representative temperature scans of the resistivity at constant fields at 0 T, 0.08 T, 0.18 T, 0.42 T, 0.74 T and 0.96 T.

  by using the relation \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi(0)^{2}, in which \Phi_{0} is the quantum flux and estimating \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) to be 1.5 T. The value of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) is well below the Pauli paramagnetic limit [40] of \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{P}(0)=1.85\,T_{\rm c}=3.15 T, suggesting an orbital pair-breaking mechanism. The upward curvature near T_{c} in the H_{c2}(T) data shown in Fig. 11 may come from a distribution of T_{c} values in the sample [41, 42, 43, 44] or multiband superconductivity as was discussed by Shulga _et al._[45] or nonlocal correction [46, 47] to the Ginzburg-Landau equations. Similar H_{c2}(\rm T) curvatures were found for YNi_{2}B_{2}C as well as LuNi_{2}B_{2}C [45].

The electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm e-ph} can be estimated from the McMillan equation [48] for the superconducting transition temperature [Eq. (2)], for phonon-mediated superconductors,

\[T_{c}=\frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45}\exp\left[-\frac{1.04(1+\lambda_{\rm e-ph})} {\lambda_{\rm e-ph}-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda_{\rm e-ph})}\right],\] (2)

where \mu^{*}, the Coulomb pseudopotential, having value often between 0.1 and 0.2 and usually taken as 0.13 [48]. Similar values of \mu^{*} have been used in isostructural compounds [20, 21, 23]. Using \Theta_{\rm D}=196 K and T_{c}=1.7 K we estimated \lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.54. A difference of \mu_{\rm c} from the assumed value of 0.13 will give a different value of \lambda_{\rm e-ph}. For example, \lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.48 if \mu=0.1 and \lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.69 if \mu=0.2. By using both normal state and superconducting state specific heat data, one can obtain the thermodynamic critical field, \mu_{0}H_{c}(0) as a function of temperature from Eq. (3),

\[\frac{\mu_{0}V_{m}H_{c}(0)^{2}}{2}=\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\Delta S(T^{\prime})dT^{ \prime},\] (3)

in which \Delta S(T) is the entropy difference between the normal and superconducting states and V_{m} (8.54\times 10^{-5} m^{3} mol^{-1}) is the molar volume. The calculated value of \mu_{0}H_{c}(0) is 23 mT for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}. This value is larger than the value of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} and clearly reflects the larger \gamma and T_{c} of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}:

\[\mu_{0}H_{c}(0) = 1.76\times 10^{-4}\,[4\pi\,D(\epsilon_{\rm F})]^{1/2}\,k_{\rm B}T_{ c},\] (4a) \[\frac{\gamma}{V_{m}} = \frac{1}{15}\pi^{2}D(\epsilon_{F})k_{B}^{2},\] (4b) \[\mu_{0}H_{c}(0) = 1.76\left(\frac{6\gamma\,\mu_{0}}{4\pi^{2}V_{m}}\right)^{1/2}T_{ c}.\] (4c)

Using BCS theory results [4] [Eqs. (4a) and (4b)] we can eliminate the D(\epsilon_{F}) term and, for the limit of an isotropic gap function, use Eq. (4c) to calculate the value of \mu_{0}H_{c}(0) = 21 mT. This value is close to the calculated value using specific heat.

Also the penetration depth \lambda(0) and GL parameter \kappa are found to be 7450 A and 50 from Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively:

\[\mu_{0}H_{c}(0) \approx \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\sqrt{2}\lambda(0)\xi(0)},\] (5) \[\kappa \approx \frac{\lambda(0)}{\xi(0)}.\] (6)

From the specific heat jump and using Rutger's relation, \Delta C/T_{c}=(1/8\pi\kappa^{2})(dH_{c2}/dT)^{2}|_{T_{c}}[49], one can obtain a similar \kappa value of 30. The obtained \lambda(0) and \kappa values of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} are smaller than the values of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}[23], but the value of \kappa (\kappa>1/\sqrt{2}) is large enough to consider Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} is a type II superconductor.

## IV Conclusions

Single crystals of the closely related Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} and Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} systems were synthesized by high-temperature solution growth. Resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements were carried out to characterize their normal states and, for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}, superconducting properties. Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} manifests a structural phase transition around 165 K. No superconductivity was observed down to 0.5 K. Single-crystal diffraction measurements at 120 and 300 K confirmed that a threefold superstructure develops. We noticed a large, in-plane, resistivity anisotropy in this compound. Thermal hysteresis and the specific heat feature at 165 K are consistent with a first-order phase transition. The Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma=9.41 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and the Debye temperature = 209 K were calculated by using low-temperature specific-heat data. Based on our measurements, we do not have evidence of a CDW-type mechanism being responsible for this transition.

Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} adopts a monoclinic (C/2m) crystal structure. This material shows a signature of superconductivity in the resistivity and specific-heat measurements consistent with bulk superconductivity below the critical temperature T_{c} of 1.7 K. The calculated values for the Sommerfeld coefficient and the Debye temperature are 22 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and 196 K respectively. Analysis of the jump in the specific heat at T_{c}, suggest that Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} as a weak electron-phonon coupled, BCS superconductor.

###### Abstract

Single crystals of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} and Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} were synthesized by solution growth, and the crystal structures and thermodynamic and transport properties of both compounds were studied. In the case of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}, a structural first-order transition at around 165 K is identified by single-crystal diffraction experiments, with clear signatures visible in resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat data. No superconducting transition for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} was observed down to 0.5 K. In contrast, no structural phase transition at high temperature was observed for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}; however, bulk superconductivity with a critical temperature, T_{c}\approx 1.7 K, was observed. The Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma and the Debye temperature (\Theta_{\rm D}) were found to be 9.41 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and 209 K, respectively, for Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, and 22 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and 196 K, respectively, for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}. Study of the specific heat in the superconducting state of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} suggests that Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} is a weakly coupled, BCS superconductor.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) are fascinating and closely linked collective phenomena. The CDW in low-dimensional materials was first proposed by Peierls [1, 2], who showed that a one-dimensional metal was unstable against a periodic lattice distortion, which creates an energy gap at the Fermi level. Superconductivity and CDW states were linked when Frohlich proposed a mechanism of superconductivity based on a sliding, incommensurate CDW [3]. Following the formulation of the BCS theory [4] of superconductivity, it was appreciated that the superconducting state and the CDW state are both results of electron-phonon coupling often with the CDW state competing with and ultimately replacing the superconducting state as electron-phonon coupling is increased. In some, relatively rare, compounds both transitions can be found upon cooling; more often, though, a CDW or some other type of structural phase transition removes density of states at the Fermi surface and thus suppresses or even precludes the formation of a superconducting state.

It is interesting to study the properties of the materials which manifest the coexistence of superconducting and CDW states, so as to gain a better understanding of how they compete with each other for the density of states as each opens a gap at the Fermi level [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The electrical transport properties of some ternary, metal-rich chalcogenides [16, 17, 18], A_{2}M_{3}X_{2} (A = Sn, Pb, In, Tl, and Bi; M = Co, Ni, Rh, and Pd; X = S and Se) have been reported by Natarajan and coworkers [19] with some members of this family showing superconductivity at low temperature [20, 21, 22]. Recently, Sakamoto and coworkers reported that parkerite-type Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2}[23] was a new superconducting compound (with a critical temperature, T_{c}, \sim 0.7 K) with a possible higher temperature CDW transition at T_{\rm CDW}\approx 250 K. Pressure studies on this compound [24] found that the resistivity anomaly at 250 K shifted to higher temperature with increasing pressure, which is unusual for a conventional CDW transition [25, 26, 27]. Given that isostructural Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} is reported to have a resistive anomaly near 160 K (having been measured down to 77 K) [19], measurements of single crystalline Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} to lower temperatures are called for.

Using solution growth out of a Rh-rich Rh-Bi-S melt [22], our initial growth attempts produced large grain, crystalline material that showed a clear resistivity feature near 160 K but also an apparent superconducting transition near 2 K. These results indicated that there may be some form of competition or interaction between structural phase transition and superconductivity in this ternary system. A powder x-ray diffraction measurement revealed the anticipated Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} phase, but also indicated the presence of a second phase.

In order to better understand the physics and chemistry of this part of the Bi-Rh-S system, in this paper we present details of the crystal growth of both Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} and a new phase: Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}, provide structural data, and present and analyze thermodynamic and transport data from each compound. Whereas Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} manifests a first-order, structural-phase transition near 160 K and does not superconduct for T>0.5 K, Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} manifests no signs of any phase transition for 2 K <T<300 K has a significantly larger electronic specific heat coefficient, \gamma, and manifests bulk superconductivity below 2 K. Instead of finding the coexistence of a structural phase transition and subsequent superconductivity in one compound we found two closely related compounds: one that manifests a structural phase transition near 160 K and has a relatively lower electronic specific heat at low temperatures and another that does not undergo a structural phase transition upon cooling, has a relatively larger electronic specific heat, and does become superconducting below 2 K.

## II Experimental Methods

Single crystals of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} and Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} were produced using solution growth techniques [22, 28, 29]. For Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, a mixture of elemental Rh, Bi, and S was placed in a 2-ml fritted  alumina crucible [30], with a molar ratio of Rh:Bi:S = 42.6:28.2:29.2, and sealed in a silica ampule under partial pressure of high-purity argon gas. The sealed ampule was heated to 1150 degC over 12 h and held there for 3 h. After that, it was cooled to 900 degC over 70 h and excess liquid was decanted using a centrifuge. For Bi2Rh3.S2, a molar ratio of Rh:Bi:S = 55:22.5:25 was used, heated, and cooled in a similar manner but slowly cooled to 775 degC before decanting.

Powder x-ray diffraction data were collected by using a Rigaku Miniflex II diffractometer at room temperature (Cu K_a_ radiation). Samples were prepared by grinding single crystals into powder and spreading them onto a thin-grease-layer-coated single-crystal Si, low-background puck. Powder x-ray diffraction data were analyzed using the GSAS [31,32] program.

Single-crystal diffraction data were measured using a Bruker Smart Apex CCD diffractometer [33] with Mo K_a_ radiation (l = 0.71073 A). Data were collected with mixed _o_/_ph_ scan modes and with an exposure time of 10 s per frame. The 2_th_ range covered from 6 deg to 64 deg. Intensities were extracted and corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects with the SAINT program. Empirical absorption corrections [34] were accomplished with SADABS, which is based on modeling a transmission surface by spherical harmonics employing equivalent reflections with I > 3 _a_(I). Using the

Lattice parameters were refined using single-crystal diffraction data and are summarized in Table 1. Atomic coordinates and displacement parameters with fully site occupation for Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} and Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} are given in Table 2.

The ac resistivity (f = 17 Hz) was measured as a function of temperature by the standard four-probe method in a Quantum Design, physical property measurement system (PPMS) instrument. Depending on the sample size Pt or Au wires (with the diameter of 25 \mum or 12.7 \mum, respectively) were attached to the samples using Epotek-H20E silver epoxy or DuPont 4929N silver paint. The specific heat was measured by using the relaxation method in a PPMS. The ^{3}He option was used to obtain a measurements down to 0.4 K. The DC magnetization measurements were performed in a Quantum Design, magnetic property measurement system (MPMS).

## III Results

### Phases and structures

The room temperature powder x-ray diffraction pattern from ground, phase-pure, single crystals of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} are shown in Fig. 1. Single crystal x-ray diffraction used to refine the lattice parameter of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} with monoclinic C2/m symmetry, a = 11.291(3) A, b = 8.378(2) A, c = 7.942(4) A, and \beta = 133.286(2)^{\circ}. These crystallographic parameters are within three standard deviations from literature data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}[19, 36]. Also these lattice parameters were used to fit the powder x-ray diffraction data shown in Fig. 1. Resistivity data measured on Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} single crystals show only a single transition at \sim165 K (see Fig. 6 below), with no superconductivity being observed down to 0.5 K.

To understand the phase transition of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} at 165 K, a set of single-crystal x-ray diffraction intensity data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} was collected at low-temperature (LT), ca. 120 K. As shown in Fig. 2, extra diffraction spots, not belonging to the unit cell of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} at room-temperature [a = 11.291(3) A, b = 8.378(2) A, c = 7.943(4) A, \beta = 133.286(2)^{\circ}], were observed in the (h0l) zone prerecession image. However, all spots could be completely indexed by a larger monoclinic unit cell

Green circles in (a) denote reflections that can be indexed by the base cell [C2/m, a = 11.291(3) Å, b = 8.378(2) Å, c = 7.942(2) Å, \beta = 133.286(2)^{\circ}]; note that many reflections cannot be indexed. Yellow circles in (b) denote the reflections that can be indexed by the supercell [a = 11.542(2) Å, b = 8.341(2) Å, c = 17.768(4) Å, \beta = 107.614(2)^{\circ}].

  [C2/m, a = 11.542(2) A, b = 8.341(2) A, c = 17.768(4) A, b = 107.614(2)c], which is about three times larger than the unit cell at room temperature (RT), cf. Table 1. Comparison of the RT and LT structures of Bi2Rh3S2, shown in Fig. 3, indicate that the flat two-dimensional (2D) layers in the RT structure (parallel to _ab_ plane) are periodically puckered in the LT superstructure.

The x-ray powder diffraction pattern of a ground, phase-pure, single crystal of Bi2Rh3.5S2 is shown in Fig. 4. According to single-crystal x-ray diffraction analyses (Table 1), Bi2Rh3.5S2 also crystallizes in monoclinic symmetry C2/m [_a_ = 11.5212(3) A, b = 7.9408(2) A, c = 7.8730(3) A, and b = 128.033(2)c]. These lattice parameters were used to fit the powder x-ray diffraction data shown in Fig. 4. Figure 5 shows the structure of Bi2Rh3.5S2 viewed along the (010) direction. Compared to the RT structure of Bi2Rh3S2, Fig. 3(a), the 2D layers in Bi2Rh3.5S2 are extensively puckered or distorted in response to the insertion of additional Rh atoms into octahedral vacancies between adjacent layers. As will be discussed below, the low-temperature electronic specific heat of Bi2Rh3.5S2 is almost double that of Bi2Rh3S2, consist with superconductivity in the former but not the latter.

### Physical properties of Bi2Rh3S2

The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity data from Bi2Rh3S2 (Fig. 6) show a sharp feature associated with a 165 K transition with no superconducting transition observed down to 0.5 K. This material shows clear in-plane anisotropy in resistivity. Figure 6 presents the data from two samples with current flowing along each of the edge directions indicated in the lower inset. The residual resistivity ratio (RRR) values are found to be 53 and 15 in these two directions, suggesting that the in-plane scattering and/or the Fermi velocity is anisotropic. Above 170 K the resistivity increases monotonically with temperature, showing metallic behavior. Around 165 K a sudden increase or decrease of resistivity with decreasing temperature is observed in the two different, in-plane, current directions. Below 160 K, resistivity again shows metallic like behavior down to 0.5 K. The upper inset to Fig. 6 shows a 2-5 K thermal hysteresis observed in the resistivity jump near 165 K, suggesting a first-order phase transition, as confirmed by our single-crystal x-ray diffraction analyses. Whereas this behavior is typical for structural transition, it is less common for a CDW transition [7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 23], which is often second

  order and usually manifests an increase in resistivity due to a reduction of the density of states at the Fermi energy due to opening up of a gap in the electronic density of states at the Fermi surface. We did not observe T^{2} behavior of the resistivity down to our base temperature.

Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility \chi (T). Since the signal from one piece of single crystal is very low and in order to measure the magnetic susceptibility, we measured the magnetization of several single crystals encapsulated in a sample holder and subtract the background signal due to the sample holder. The negative value of the magnetic susceptibility indicates the overall diamagnetic behavior of this compound. This is due to the dominating contribution from core diamagnetism. By subtracting the core diamagnetic contribution [37,38] we can estimate the electronic contribution to the susceptibility. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of the electronic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility, after the diamagnetic correction [37,38] (\chi_{\rm core} = -17\times10^{-5} emu mol^{-1}). Susceptibility linearly decreases with the decreasing temperature down to 165 K and then shows dramatic change at 165 K. Given that both Pauli paramagnetic and Landau diamagnetic susceptibility are proportional to the density of state at the Fermi level D(\epsilon_{\rm F}), the change in \chi at 165 K is consistent with an increase in the density of state at the Fermi level D(\epsilon_{\rm F}). In a typical CDW material there is a reduction of the density of state at the Fermi energy due to opening up of a gap in the electronic density of states at the Fermi surface. An increase in density of state is not consistent with the CDW mechanism for structural phase transition. The low-temperature upturn (below 25 K) in the susceptibility is probably due to the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic impurities in the sample.

The temperature-dependent specific heat of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} (Fig. 8) shows a broadened latent heat feature, consistent with the first-order-like features seen in the resistivity and magnetization data shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The room-temperature specific heat of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, 172.6 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}, is close to the Dulong-Petit limit, C_{V} = 3n R = 174.6 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}. The Sommerfeld coefficient, \gamma = 9.41 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and \beta = 1.49 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4} values were obtained for the LT phase from the low-temperature data fitted with C_{p}/T = \gamma + \betaT^{2}, as shown in the lower inset of Fig. 8. From \beta we obtained a Debye temperature (\Theta_{\rm D}) of 209 K by using Eq. (1) and slightly larger than the value of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2}. This reflects a higher phonon density of states at low energies, which are likely due to the presence of the lighter element "Sulfur" compared to "Selenium." A similar value of \gamma = 9.5 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} was

  obtained in isostructural Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2} compound [23]:

\[\Theta_{\rm D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{2}nR}{5\beta}\right)^{1/3}.\] (1)

With our measurements of single-crystal diffraction, resistivity, magnetization, and the specific heat, we can conclude the phase transition in Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} at 165 K is a first-order structural phase transition. We do not have clear evidence of a CDW being associated with this transition.

In the case of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2}, based on the results of the resistivity, magnetization, thermoelectric power, thermal expansion, and low-temperature x-ray measurements, Sakamoto _et al._[23] conclude that the anomaly at \sim250 K is a CDW transition. However, Chen _et al._[24] report that, based on their experiments of pressure and selected-area electron diffraction study, phase transition at \sim250 K is not a CDW transition, rather a structural transition. In the present case of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, further advanced measurements would be needed to find any support for a possible CDW.

### Physical properties of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}

Figure 9 presents the temperature dependence of resistivity of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}, which, unlike Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}, does not show any transitions in the resistivity data around 165 K. However, it does manifest zero resistivity below 2 K, indicating an onset of a superconducting transition at this temperature. RRR of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} is 6.4, less than the RRR of Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2}. We did not observe T^{2} behavior in resistivity down to the base temperature of our measurement.

Figure 10 shows the low temperature specific heat data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}. The open red squares represent zero-field measurements, whereas the open black circles represent measurements under 1 T magnetic field, i.e., H\geqslant H_{c2}(T) for the measured temperature range (see below). From the low-temperature data fitted with C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2} from 2 to 3.8 K, as shown in the upper inset of Fig. 10, we find \gamma= 22 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and \beta= 1.94 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4} and can infer that \Theta_{\rm D} = 196 K. We can clearly see that \gamma of the superconducting Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} is twice as large as that for the nonsuperconducting Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} or Bi_{2}Rh_{3}Se_{2}[23]. Also, this value is larger than the other reported parkerite-type superconductors, Bi_{2}Ni_{3}S_{2}[20], Bi_{2}Ni_{3}Se_{2}[20], and Bi_{2}Pd_{3}Se_{2}[21].

On one hand, T_{c}=1.7 K was obtained by using an equal entropy construction to the low-temperature specific-heat data. On the other hand, the H=0C_{p}(T) data start to separate from the H=1 T C_{p}(T) data below 2.2 K. Specific-heat jump of \Delta C=52.4 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-1} gives \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}=1.39, which is close to the BCS value 1.43 for a weak-coupling superconductor. The green-colored solid line represents a BCS [4; 39] calculation. The deviation above 4 K, normal-state data from the simple Debye model indicates the presence of at least a T^{5} term in the lattice contribution.

The lower inset of Fig. 10 shows zero-field-cooled (ZFC) data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}. We were not able to see the full transition in ZFC measurements because the minimum temperature that we can reach in the MPMS is 1.8 K. These data are consistent with the broadened transition seen in the resistivity and the C_{p}(T) data.

The upper inset of Fig. 9 shows the field dependence of the superconducting transition for temperatures from 0.4 to 0.8 K and the lower inset shows the temperature dependence of the superconducting transition from 0 to 0.96 T applied field. Figure 11 shows \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) as a function of the critical temperature determined from the resistivity data. Lower and upper insets show the maximum slope of the resistivity extrapolated to \rho=0, used as a criteria to obtain the \mu_{0}H_{c2} and T_{c}, respectively. We can estimate the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length [39] at zero temperature, \xi(0)=150

Green color solid line shows the BCS calculation. The upper inset represents the C_{p}/T vs. T^{2} graph, which was used to obtain \gamma and \beta values. Lower inset shows ZFC M/H data of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}.

Upper inset shows representative field scans of the resistivity at constant temperatures at 0.4 K, 0.6 K and 0.8 K. Lower inset shows representative temperature scans of the resistivity at constant fields at 0 T, 0.08 T, 0.18 T, 0.42 T, 0.74 T and 0.96 T.

  by using the relation \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi(0)^{2}, in which \Phi_{0} is the quantum flux and estimating \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) to be 1.5 T. The value of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) is well below the Pauli paramagnetic limit [40] of \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{P}(0)=1.85\,T_{\rm c}=3.15 T, suggesting an orbital pair-breaking mechanism. The upward curvature near T_{c} in the H_{c2}(T) data shown in Fig. 11 may come from a distribution of T_{c} values in the sample [41, 42, 43, 44] or multiband superconductivity as was discussed by Shulga _et al._[45] or nonlocal correction [46, 47] to the Ginzburg-Landau equations. Similar H_{c2}(\rm T) curvatures were found for YNi_{2}B_{2}C as well as LuNi_{2}B_{2}C [45].

The electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm e-ph} can be estimated from the McMillan equation [48] for the superconducting transition temperature [Eq. (2)], for phonon-mediated superconductors,

\[T_{c}=\frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45}\exp\left[-\frac{1.04(1+\lambda_{\rm e-ph})} {\lambda_{\rm e-ph}-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda_{\rm e-ph})}\right],\] (2)

where \mu^{*}, the Coulomb pseudopotential, having value often between 0.1 and 0.2 and usually taken as 0.13 [48]. Similar values of \mu^{*} have been used in isostructural compounds [20, 21, 23]. Using \Theta_{\rm D}=196 K and T_{c}=1.7 K we estimated \lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.54. A difference of \mu_{\rm c} from the assumed value of 0.13 will give a different value of \lambda_{\rm e-ph}. For example, \lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.48 if \mu=0.1 and \lambda_{\rm e-ph}=0.69 if \mu=0.2. By using both normal state and superconducting state specific heat data, one can obtain the thermodynamic critical field, \mu_{0}H_{c}(0) as a function of temperature from Eq. (3),

\[\frac{\mu_{0}V_{m}H_{c}(0)^{2}}{2}=\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\Delta S(T^{\prime})dT^{ \prime},\] (3)

in which \Delta S(T) is the entropy difference between the normal and superconducting states and V_{m} (8.54\times 10^{-5} m^{3} mol^{-1}) is the molar volume. The calculated value of \mu_{0}H_{c}(0) is 23 mT for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}. This value is larger than the value of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} and clearly reflects the larger \gamma and T_{c} of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}:

\[\mu_{0}H_{c}(0) = 1.76\times 10^{-4}\,[4\pi\,D(\epsilon_{\rm F})]^{1/2}\,k_{\rm B}T_{ c},\] (4a) \[\frac{\gamma}{V_{m}} = \frac{1}{15}\pi^{2}D(\epsilon_{F})k_{B}^{2},\] (4b) \[\mu_{0}H_{c}(0) = 1.76\left(\frac{6\gamma\,\mu_{0}}{4\pi^{2}V_{m}}\right)^{1/2}T_{ c}.\] (4c)

Using BCS theory results [4] [Eqs. (4a) and (4b)] we can eliminate the D(\epsilon_{F}) term and, for the limit of an isotropic gap function, use Eq. (4c) to calculate the value of \mu_{0}H_{c}(0) = 21 mT. This value is close to the calculated value using specific heat.

Also the penetration depth \lambda(0) and GL parameter \kappa are found to be 7450 A and 50 from Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively:

\[\mu_{0}H_{c}(0) \approx \frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\sqrt{2}\lambda(0)\xi(0)},\] (5) \[\kappa \approx \frac{\lambda(0)}{\xi(0)}.\] (6)

From the specific heat jump and using Rutger's relation, \Delta C/T_{c}=(1/8\pi\kappa^{2})(dH_{c2}/dT)^{2}|_{T_{c}}[49], one can obtain a similar \kappa value of 30. The obtained \lambda(0) and \kappa values of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} are smaller than the values of Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}[23], but the value of \kappa (\kappa>1/\sqrt{2}) is large enough to consider Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} is a type II superconductor.

## IV Conclusions

Single crystals of the closely related Bi_{2}Rh_{3}S_{2} and Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} systems were synthesized by high-temperature solution growth. Resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements were carried out to characterize their normal states and, for Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2}, superconducting properties. Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} manifests a structural phase transition around 165 K. No superconductivity was observed down to 0.5 K. Single-crystal diffraction measurements at 120 and 300 K confirmed that a threefold superstructure develops. We noticed a large, in-plane, resistivity anisotropy in this compound. Thermal hysteresis and the specific heat feature at 165 K are consistent with a first-order phase transition. The Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma=9.41 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and the Debye temperature = 209 K were calculated by using low-temperature specific-heat data. Based on our measurements, we do not have evidence of a CDW-type mechanism being responsible for this transition.

Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} adopts a monoclinic (C/2m) crystal structure. This material shows a signature of superconductivity in the resistivity and specific-heat measurements consistent with bulk superconductivity below the critical temperature T_{c} of 1.7 K. The calculated values for the Sommerfeld coefficient and the Debye temperature are 22 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and 196 K respectively. Analysis of the jump in the specific heat at T_{c}, suggest that Bi_{2}Rh_{3.5}S_{2} as a weak electron-phonon coupled, BCS superconductor.
