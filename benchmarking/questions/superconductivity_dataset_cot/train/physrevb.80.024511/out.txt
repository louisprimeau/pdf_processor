###### Abstract

Single crystalline Ba(Fe1-_x_M_x_)2As2 (_M_ = Rh, Pd) series have been grown and characterized by structural, thermodynamic, and transport measurements. These measurements show that the structural/magnetic phase transitions, found in pure BaFe2As2 at 134 K, are suppressed monotonically by the doping and that superconductivity can be stabilized over a domelike region. Temperature-composition (_T_ = _x_) phase diagrams based on electrical transport and magnetization measurements are constructed and compared to those of the Ba(Fe1-_M_x_)2As2 (_M_ = Co, Ni) series. Despite the generic difference between 3d and 4d shells and the specific, conspicuous differences in the changes to the unit cell parameters, the effects of Rh doping are exceptionally similar to the effects of Co doping and the effects of Pd doping are exceptionally similar to the effects of Ni doping. These data show that whereas the structural/antiferromagnetic phase-transition temperatures can be parameterized by x and the superconducting transition temperature can be parameterized by some combination of x and e, the number of extra electrons associated with the M doping, the transition temperatures of 3_d_- and 4_d_-doped BaFe2As2 cannot be simply parameterized by the changes in the unit-cell dimensions or their ratios.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO [1] and K-doped BaFe2As2 (Ref. [2]) compounds in the first half of 2008 has led to extensive experimental interest; _T_c has risen as high as 56 K for F doped RFeAsO systems [3] and as high as 38 K in K and Na doped (AE)Fe2As2 systems (AE: Ba, Sr, Ca). [2] Soon after, superconductivity was also found in Co and Ni doped (AE)Fe2As2 (Refs. [4; 5] and [6] and RFeAsO. [6] Recently, superconductivity was also found in _4d_ and _5d_ transition metal electron doped SrFe2As2. [7; 8; 9; 10] Although electron doped (AE)Fe2As2 systems have lower _T_c values (~24 K), [11; 12; 13; 14] intensive studies have been made on them because doping is more homogeneous in these systems and the single crystals can be easily grown and reproduced. For example, several studies of Ba(Fe1-_Co_x_)2As2 system have resulted in remarkably similar data and conclusions. [11; 12; 13; 14] In order to compare the effects of 3d and 4d electron doping in BaFe2As2, and thus try to understand the conditions for the appearance of superconductivity in these systems, carefully constructed T = x phase diagrams are needed. Elemental analysis, preferably of single crystal samples, should be used to determine the actual percentage of the dopant inside the lattice rather than the nominal doping level. Recently such a detailed study was made for Co doped BaFe2As2, [11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16] as well as for Ni, Cu, and Cu/Co mixes. [17] These data on 3d, electron doped BaFe2As2 raised the question of whether the number of impurities, the band filling, and/or the unit-cell dimensions were the physically salient variables. For this paper, Ba(Fe1-_M_x_)2As2 (_M_ = Rh, Pd) series have been studied by the electrical transport, magnetization, specific heat, and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy. We find that the T - x phase diagrams for Co and Rh doping are virtually identical, as are the phase diagrams for Ni and Pd doping. By analysis of the relative changes in the unit-cell parameters we can conclude that whereas x and e can still successfully be used to parameterize the structural/magnetic and superconducting phase transitions in the Ba(Fe1-_M_x_)2As2 systems, changes in the unit-cell parameters, or their ratios, no longer can.

## II Experimental methods

Single crystals of Ba(Fe1-_M_x_)2As2 (_M_ = Rh, Pd) were grown out of self flux using conventional high-temperature solution growth techniques. [11; 18] FeAs, RhAs and PdAs powder were synthesized in the same manner as in Ref. [11]. Small Ba chunks, FeAs/RhAs or FeAs/PdAs powder were mixed together according to the ratio Ba: _M_As = 1 : 4. The mixture was placed into an alumina crucible with a second "catch" crucible containing quartz wool placed on top. Both crucibles were sealed in a quartz tube under a 1/3 partial atmosphere of Ar gas. The sealed quartz tube was heated up to 1180 degC over 12 h, held at 1180 degC for 5 h, and then cooled to 1050 degC over 36 h. Once the furnace reached 1050 degC, the excess FeAs/RhAs or FeAs/PdAs liquid was decanted from the plate like single crystals.

Powder x-ray diffraction measurements, with a Si standard, were performed using a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation at room temperature. Diffraction patterns were taken on ground single crystals from each batch. No detectable impurities were found in these compounds. The unit cell parameters were refined by "UnitCell" software. Error bars were taken as twice the standard deviation, s, which was obtained from the refinements by the "UnitCell" software. Elemental analysis of the samples was performed using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in the electron probe microanalyzer of a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe. Magnetization and temperature-dependent ac electrical resistance data (_f_ = 16 Hz, I = 3 mA) were collected in a Quantum Design (QD) Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) using LR700 resistance bridge for the latter. Electrical contact was made to the sample using Epotek H2Oe silver epoxy to attach Pt wires in a four-probe configuration. Heat-capacity data were collected using a QD Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) using the relaxation technique.

## III Results

Summaries of the WDS measurement data are shown in Table 1 for both Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{x})_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Pd_{x})_{2}As_{2}. For each batch, up to five pieces of samples were measured. The table shows the number of locations measured, the average of the x values measured at these locations, and two times the standard deviation of the x values measured on these locations, which is taken as the error bar in this paper. We can see that the 2\sigma error bars are \leq10% of the average x values. The average x value, x_{\rm ave}, obtained from wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) measurement will be used for all the compounds in this paper rather than nominal x. It is worth noting that separate measurements of x_{\rm ave} on the resistivity bars gave values within the 2\sigma error bars for all the measured batches.

Figure 1 presents the normalized electrical resistivity data of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{x})_{2}As_{2} series from base temperature, 2 to 300 K. Normalized resistivity, instead of resistivity, is plotted because of the tendency of these samples to exfoliate or partially crack.[11, 19, 20] The resistive anomaly at 134 K for pure BaFe_{2}As_{2} is associated with the structural/magnetic phase transitions.[21] As in the case of Co, Ni and Cu substitutions,[17, 11] as x is increased the temperature of the resistive anomaly is suppressed monotonically and the shape of the feature changes from a sharp decrease in pure BaFe_{2}As_{2} to a broadened increase in doped samples. It is no longer detectable for x \geq 0.057. For x = 0.026, superconductivity becomes detectable, with T_{c} = 3 K inferred from the sharp drop in the resistivity data. For x = 0.057, superconducting temperature T_{c} has a maximum value of 24 K with a width \Delta T_{c} \approx 0.7 K. With even higher x, T_{c} is suppressed.

Figure 2 shows the M/H data for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{x})_{2}As_{2} series taken at 25 Oe with H perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. A clear diamagnetic signal can be seen in both field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) data. Because of the low T_{c} values for x = 0.026 and x = 0.131, which are on the low- and high-x extremes of the superconductivity dome respectively, we only observe the onset of the diamagnetic signal and no large drop below the superconducting temperature is seen down to our base temperature of 2 K. However, for all the other concentrations, the large superconducting, shielding fraction and the sharp drop below T_{c} are consistent with the existence of bulk superconductivity. Compared to

  the low-field M/H data for Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2}[11] the superconducting fraction associated with the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{y})_{2}As_{2} series have very similar values as of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} series.

The temperature-dependent heat-capacity data for Ba(Fe_{0.943}Rh_{0.057})As_{2} is shown in Fig. 3. This concentration has the maximum T_{c} value in this series. The heat capacity anomaly is relatively sharp and consistent with the superconducting phase transition we observed in both resistivity and low-field magnetization data. The large arrow in the inset shows the onset of superconductivity and T_{c}=23.2 K. A way to estimate \Delta C_{p} is also shown in the inset; \Delta C_{p}\approx 700 mJ/mol K. Assuming the BCS weak coupling approximation \Delta C_{p}/\gamma/\gamma=1.43 and 100% superconducting volume, the \gamma value for Ba(Fe_{0.943}Rh_{0.057})_{2}As_{2} can be estimated to be about 20 mJ/mol K^{2}, which is comparable to the value estimated in the same manner for Ba(Fe_{0.943}Co_{0.074})_{2}As_{2}[22].

Figure 4 shows the normalized electrical resistivity data for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Pd_{x})_{2}As_{2} series from base temperature, 2 to 300 K. A systematic behavior, similar to the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{y})_{2}As_{2} series, is seen: the temperature of the resistive anomaly associated with the structural/antiferromagnetic phase transitions is suppressed monotonically with Pd doping and the shape of the anomaly changes from a sharp decrease to a broadened increase in resistivity upon cooling. For x=0.021, the resistive anomaly can still be clearly seen and superconductivity is detected with T_{c}\approx 5.7 K. For x=0.043, the temperature of the resistive anomaly is further reduced and it is only inferred from a minimum in the resistivity above the superconducting transition. For x=0.053, the resistive anomaly is completely suppressed and T_{c} has its highest value of about 19 K and a width of \Delta T_{c}\approx 0.6 K. With higher x values, T_{c} is suppressed.

The low-field M/H data for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Pd_{x})_{2}As_{2} series (FC and ZFC) are shown in Fig. 5. They were taken at 25 Oe with H perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. The broader feature seen in the magnetization for x=0.027 implies a larger inhomogeneity associated with this sample. Indeed, the WDS data for x=0.027 does show local maximum in 2\sigma values. Despite the broader drop of the magnetization, the large superconducting fraction is comparable to the rest of the Pd-doped series as well as to the Co, Ni, and Rh doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} results, all of which are consistent with bulk superconductivity. Again, only a small diamagnetic signal was observed at base temperature for x=0.021 due to the low T_{c} for this concentration.

Figure 6 shows the temperature-dependent heat-capacity data for Ba(Fe_{0.957}Pd_{0.043})_{2}As_{2}, which manifests the highest T_{c} value in this series. The heat-capacity anomaly at T_{c} can be clearly seen, although it is broader than the one found for Ba(Fe_{0.943}Rh_{0.057})_{2}As_{2} (Fig. 3). The arrows show the onset of superconductivity at T_{c}=18 K and the estimated \Delta C_{p} is shown in the inset; \Delta C_{p}\approx 410 mJ/mol K. Using the BCS weak coupling approximation \Delta C_{p}/\gammaT_{c}=1.43 and assuming 100% superconducting volume in this sample, \gamma for Ba(Fe_{0.957}Pd_{0.043})_{2}As_{2} is estimated to be about 16 mJ/mol K^{2}.

## IV Discussion

The data presented in Figs. 1-6 are summarized in the two, T-x, phase diagrams shown in Fig. 7. In this paper, the temperature of structural/magnetic phase transitions are inferred from the derivative of the temperature-dependent resistivity data which shows a split feature for finite values of

  x.[11] The inset to Fig. 7 shows such a d\rho/dT curve as well as the criteria used to determine the upper (structural) transition and the lower (antiferromagnetic) transition temperatures. As shown in Ref. [16] these criteria identify transition temperatures that agree well with the results of neutron- and x-ray diffraction measurements. On- and off-set criteria, which are shown in the inset of Fig. 1, are used to determine T_{c} from the resistivity data. The criterion which is shown in the inset of Fig. 2 is used to determine T_{c} from the magnetization data. The arrows in Fig. 3 show the criterion used to infer T_{c} from heat-capacity data. We can see good agreement between resistivity, magnetization, and heat-capacity measurements. So as to allow comparison with the isoelectronic, 3d electron doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} compounds, data for Ba(Fe_{1-M}_{x})_{2}As_{2} (M = Co, Ni) (Refs. [11] and [17]) are also shown.

The upper panel presents the T-x phase diagrams of Rh and Co doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} and the lower panel presents the T-x phase diagrams of Pd and Ni doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}. It can be seen in both panels that the higher-temperature structural/magnetic phase transitions are suppressed monotonically in a similar manner/rate for all series. Superconductivity is found in both tetragonal and orthorhombic phase,[11, 12, 13, 14] and is stabilized in a domelike region for all series. Superconductivity is found over a wider range of Co or Rh doping with a maximum T_{c} around 24 K, and a narrower range of Ni or Pd doping with a maximum T_{c} around 19 K.

The complete phase diagram of Rh doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} including both structural/magnetic phase transition and superconductivity shows incredible similarity as the phase diagram of Co doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} and the complete phase diagram of Pd doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} shows incredible similarity as the phase diagram of Ni doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}. For each of the pairs, the phase diagrams show exceptionally similar behavior on the rate of the suppression of structural/magnetic phase transitions, the range of superconducting domes and the maximum T_{c}. It is worth mentioning again that to see this, the actual x values are vital. A similar agreement between T_{c}(x) domes for Co/Rh and Ni/Pd has been noted in Sr(Fe_{1-M}_{x})_{2}As_{2}.[23]

In our previous work,[17] we compared the transition temperatures as a function of x, and as a function of the number of extra conduction electrons, e, added by the dopant per Fe/M site for Co, Ni, Cu, and Co/Cu doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (for the case of Co: e=x, for the case of Ni: e=2x). We conclude that whereas the suppression of the structural/antiferromagnetic transitions was parameterized somewhat better by the number of M dopant ions (or, equivalently, changes in the c axis) the superconducting dome was parameterized by the number of electrons added by doping (or, equivalently, changes in the values of the a/c ratio), and exists over a limited range of e values (or band filling). Unfortunately we could not experimentally separate the effects of x and e from changes in c and a/c, respectively.[17] However, with current, 4d-electron doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} data, we can actually distinguish between x and e on one hand and c, a/c on the other. Figure 8 shows the unit-cell parameters normalized by the lattice parameters of pure BaFe_{2}As_{2}. To compare the unit-cell parameters, the data for Co or Ni doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [11] and [17]) are also plotted in Fig. 8. The lattice parameter c decreases with all dopings and the ratio of a/c increases with all dopings. But in both cases there is a clear difference between the 3d- and 4d-data sets. Unlike in our previous work,[17] where for 3d-electron doping series and c can be scaled with x, and a/c can be scaled with the number of extra electron added per Fe/M site, when 4d-electron doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} data are taken into account, changes in c and a/c are no longer equivalent to x and e. This means that if we want to parameterize the effects of 3d- and 4d-M doping on the transitions temperatures of Ba(Fe_{1-x}_{x})_{2}As_{2}, whereas the upper, structural, and magnetic phase transitions can be parameterized by x and the superconducting dome can be parameterized by e, they are no longer well parameterized

(b) Phase diagrams of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Pd_{x})_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2} series. For both plots the transition temperatures were determined in a manner similar to that described in Ref. [11] and illustrated in the inset for Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.059})_{2}As_{2}. Data for Co and Ni doping are taken from Refs. [11] and [17].

  by either c or a/c. As discussed in Ref. [17], it is still possible that some other parameter, such as bonding angles associated with the As position, offer better or alternate parameterization of these transition temperatures, but these are not currently known.

The parameterization scheme outlined above is based on the premise that a single parameter may be controlling the variation in the upper, structural, and magnetic transition temperatures (T_{s} and T_{m}) and a second one may be controlling the superconductivity (T_{c}). There is another scheme that should be discussed in the context of our growing data set: that there may be a single parameter that controls the behavior of the system when T_{s}\!\sim\!T_{m}\!\!>\!T_{c} and there is another single parameter when T_{s} and T_{m} are fully suppressed. The potential appeal of this scheme can be seen in Fig. 9, where T_{c} is plotted as a function of e and x for comparison. As discussed above and in Ref. [17], there is excellent agreement of the T_{c} values when plotted as a function of e when T_{s} and T_{m} are fully suppressed. On the other hand there is arguably better agreement of the T_{c} values when they are plotted as a function of x for T_{s}\!\sim\!T_{m}\!\!>\!T_{c}. As pointed out in Ref. [17] the behavior on the T_{s}\!\sim\!T_{m}\!\!>\!T_{c} side of the dome may be associated with the need to bring the upper transitions to low enough temperature so as to allow the superconductivity to turn on. The importance of reducing T_{s} and T_{m} may be associated with reducing the degree of orthorhombic splitting, the size of the ordered moment in the AF phase, and/or changing the magnetic excitation spectrum.

Given that T_{s} and T_{m} only roughly scale with x, it is worth while examining the correlation between T_{s}, T_{m}, and T_{c} more directly. Figure 10 plots T_{c} as a function of the structural, as well as the magnetic, transition temperature (given that they are split by the time superconductivity is stabilized).[11, 12, 15, 16]  Both plots show a clear correlation. A more graphic way of examining the correlation between T_{c} and T_{s^{\prime}}/T_{m} is to create a composite diagram for the T_{s}\simT_{m}>T_{c} data by adjusting the x scales for the Ni, Rh, and Pd data so as to collapse the T_{s} and T_{m} phase lines onto the Co data set. This is plotted in Fig. 11. As we can see, a clear consequence of this is to bring collapse the T_{c} data onto a single phase line as well.

## V V. Conclusion

Single crystalline Ba(Fe_{1-x}/M_{x})_{2}As_{2} (M=Rh, Pd) samples have been grown and characterized by microscopic, thermodynamic, and transport measurements. T-x phase diagrams were constructed for both the Rh- and Pd-doping series and, remarkably, they are virtually indistinguishable from the T-x phase diagrams assembled for their 3d-shell counterpart, Co and Ni doped, series. Given that the variations of the unit-cell parameters are distinctly different for the 3d and 4d dopants, these data clearly show that whereas the amount of dopant, x, and the change in electron count, e, do a fair job of parameterizing the structural/magnetic and superconducting phase transitions temperatures, respectively, the variation in the c-axis lattice parameter and the variation in the ratio of the a/c parameters no longer do.

Whereas the structural and magnetic phase transitions are fairly well parameterized by x and, for T_{c}>T_{s}/T_{m}, T_{c} is parameterized by e very well, the T_{c} data for T_{s}\simT_{m}>T_{c} appears to depend on the degree of suppression of T_{s}/T_{m} (and therefore may depend more on x than on e). The fact that the behavior of T_{c} in response to doping appears to change in the vicinity of the disappearance of T_{s}/T_{m} is consistent with recent studies of the T-P phase diagram for BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [24]) as well as earlier work on K doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}.[25] In every case T_{c} appears to reach its maximum value [varying from M, to K, to P (Ref. [26]) doped] when T_{s} and T_{m} are suppressed below T_{c}.

###### Abstract

Single crystalline Ba(Fe1-_x_M_x_)2As2 (_M_ = Rh, Pd) series have been grown and characterized by structural, thermodynamic, and transport measurements. These measurements show that the structural/magnetic phase transitions, found in pure BaFe2As2 at 134 K, are suppressed monotonically by the doping and that superconductivity can be stabilized over a domelike region. Temperature-composition (_T_ = _x_) phase diagrams based on electrical transport and magnetization measurements are constructed and compared to those of the Ba(Fe1-_M_x_)2As2 (_M_ = Co, Ni) series. Despite the generic difference between 3d and 4d shells and the specific, conspicuous differences in the changes to the unit cell parameters, the effects of Rh doping are exceptionally similar to the effects of Co doping and the effects of Pd doping are exceptionally similar to the effects of Ni doping. These data show that whereas the structural/antiferromagnetic phase-transition temperatures can be parameterized by x and the superconducting transition temperature can be parameterized by some combination of x and e, the number of extra electrons associated with the M doping, the transition temperatures of 3_d_- and 4_d_-doped BaFe2As2 cannot be simply parameterized by the changes in the unit-cell dimensions or their ratios.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO [1] and K-doped BaFe2As2 (Ref. [2]) compounds in the first half of 2008 has led to extensive experimental interest; _T_c has risen as high as 56 K for F doped RFeAsO systems [3] and as high as 38 K in K and Na doped (AE)Fe2As2 systems (AE: Ba, Sr, Ca). [2] Soon after, superconductivity was also found in Co and Ni doped (AE)Fe2As2 (Refs. [4; 5] and [6] and RFeAsO. [6] Recently, superconductivity was also found in _4d_ and _5d_ transition metal electron doped SrFe2As2. [7; 8; 9; 10] Although electron doped (AE)Fe2As2 systems have lower _T_c values (~24 K), [11; 12; 13; 14] intensive studies have been made on them because doping is more homogeneous in these systems and the single crystals can be easily grown and reproduced. For example, several studies of Ba(Fe1-_Co_x_)2As2 system have resulted in remarkably similar data and conclusions. [11; 12; 13; 14] In order to compare the effects of 3d and 4d electron doping in BaFe2As2, and thus try to understand the conditions for the appearance of superconductivity in these systems, carefully constructed T = x phase diagrams are needed. Elemental analysis, preferably of single crystal samples, should be used to determine the actual percentage of the dopant inside the lattice rather than the nominal doping level. Recently such a detailed study was made for Co doped BaFe2As2, [11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16] as well as for Ni, Cu, and Cu/Co mixes. [17] These data on 3d, electron doped BaFe2As2 raised the question of whether the number of impurities, the band filling, and/or the unit-cell dimensions were the physically salient variables. For this paper, Ba(Fe1-_M_x_)2As2 (_M_ = Rh, Pd) series have been studied by the electrical transport, magnetization, specific heat, and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy. We find that the T - x phase diagrams for Co and Rh doping are virtually identical, as are the phase diagrams for Ni and Pd doping. By analysis of the relative changes in the unit-cell parameters we can conclude that whereas x and e can still successfully be used to parameterize the structural/magnetic and superconducting phase transitions in the Ba(Fe1-_M_x_)2As2 systems, changes in the unit-cell parameters, or their ratios, no longer can.

## II Experimental methods

Single crystals of Ba(Fe1-_M_x_)2As2 (_M_ = Rh, Pd) were grown out of self flux using conventional high-temperature solution growth techniques. [11; 18] FeAs, RhAs and PdAs powder were synthesized in the same manner as in Ref. [11]. Small Ba chunks, FeAs/RhAs or FeAs/PdAs powder were mixed together according to the ratio Ba: _M_As = 1 : 4. The mixture was placed into an alumina crucible with a second "catch" crucible containing quartz wool placed on top. Both crucibles were sealed in a quartz tube under a 1/3 partial atmosphere of Ar gas. The sealed quartz tube was heated up to 1180 degC over 12 h, held at 1180 degC for 5 h, and then cooled to 1050 degC over 36 h. Once the furnace reached 1050 degC, the excess FeAs/RhAs or FeAs/PdAs liquid was decanted from the plate like single crystals.

Powder x-ray diffraction measurements, with a Si standard, were performed using a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation at room temperature. Diffraction patterns were taken on ground single crystals from each batch. No detectable impurities were found in these compounds. The unit cell parameters were refined by "UnitCell" software. Error bars were taken as twice the standard deviation, s, which was obtained from the refinements by the "UnitCell" software. Elemental analysis of the samples was performed using wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in the electron probe microanalyzer of a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe. Magnetization and temperature-dependent ac electrical resistance data (_f_ = 16 Hz, I = 3 mA) were collected in a Quantum Design (QD) Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) using LR700 resistance bridge for the latter. Electrical contact was made to the sample using Epotek H2Oe silver epoxy to attach Pt wires in a four-probe configuration. Heat-capacity data were collected using a QD Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) using the relaxation technique.

## III Results

Summaries of the WDS measurement data are shown in Table 1 for both Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{x})_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Pd_{x})_{2}As_{2}. For each batch, up to five pieces of samples were measured. The table shows the number of locations measured, the average of the x values measured at these locations, and two times the standard deviation of the x values measured on these locations, which is taken as the error bar in this paper. We can see that the 2\sigma error bars are \leq10% of the average x values. The average x value, x_{\rm ave}, obtained from wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) measurement will be used for all the compounds in this paper rather than nominal x. It is worth noting that separate measurements of x_{\rm ave} on the resistivity bars gave values within the 2\sigma error bars for all the measured batches.

Figure 1 presents the normalized electrical resistivity data of the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{x})_{2}As_{2} series from base temperature, 2 to 300 K. Normalized resistivity, instead of resistivity, is plotted because of the tendency of these samples to exfoliate or partially crack.[11, 19, 20] The resistive anomaly at 134 K for pure BaFe_{2}As_{2} is associated with the structural/magnetic phase transitions.[21] As in the case of Co, Ni and Cu substitutions,[17, 11] as x is increased the temperature of the resistive anomaly is suppressed monotonically and the shape of the feature changes from a sharp decrease in pure BaFe_{2}As_{2} to a broadened increase in doped samples. It is no longer detectable for x \geq 0.057. For x = 0.026, superconductivity becomes detectable, with T_{c} = 3 K inferred from the sharp drop in the resistivity data. For x = 0.057, superconducting temperature T_{c} has a maximum value of 24 K with a width \Delta T_{c} \approx 0.7 K. With even higher x, T_{c} is suppressed.

Figure 2 shows the M/H data for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{x})_{2}As_{2} series taken at 25 Oe with H perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. A clear diamagnetic signal can be seen in both field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) data. Because of the low T_{c} values for x = 0.026 and x = 0.131, which are on the low- and high-x extremes of the superconductivity dome respectively, we only observe the onset of the diamagnetic signal and no large drop below the superconducting temperature is seen down to our base temperature of 2 K. However, for all the other concentrations, the large superconducting, shielding fraction and the sharp drop below T_{c} are consistent with the existence of bulk superconductivity. Compared to

  the low-field M/H data for Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2}[11] the superconducting fraction associated with the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{y})_{2}As_{2} series have very similar values as of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} series.

The temperature-dependent heat-capacity data for Ba(Fe_{0.943}Rh_{0.057})As_{2} is shown in Fig. 3. This concentration has the maximum T_{c} value in this series. The heat capacity anomaly is relatively sharp and consistent with the superconducting phase transition we observed in both resistivity and low-field magnetization data. The large arrow in the inset shows the onset of superconductivity and T_{c}=23.2 K. A way to estimate \Delta C_{p} is also shown in the inset; \Delta C_{p}\approx 700 mJ/mol K. Assuming the BCS weak coupling approximation \Delta C_{p}/\gamma/\gamma=1.43 and 100% superconducting volume, the \gamma value for Ba(Fe_{0.943}Rh_{0.057})_{2}As_{2} can be estimated to be about 20 mJ/mol K^{2}, which is comparable to the value estimated in the same manner for Ba(Fe_{0.943}Co_{0.074})_{2}As_{2}[22].

Figure 4 shows the normalized electrical resistivity data for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Pd_{x})_{2}As_{2} series from base temperature, 2 to 300 K. A systematic behavior, similar to the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Rh_{y})_{2}As_{2} series, is seen: the temperature of the resistive anomaly associated with the structural/antiferromagnetic phase transitions is suppressed monotonically with Pd doping and the shape of the anomaly changes from a sharp decrease to a broadened increase in resistivity upon cooling. For x=0.021, the resistive anomaly can still be clearly seen and superconductivity is detected with T_{c}\approx 5.7 K. For x=0.043, the temperature of the resistive anomaly is further reduced and it is only inferred from a minimum in the resistivity above the superconducting transition. For x=0.053, the resistive anomaly is completely suppressed and T_{c} has its highest value of about 19 K and a width of \Delta T_{c}\approx 0.6 K. With higher x values, T_{c} is suppressed.

The low-field M/H data for the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Pd_{x})_{2}As_{2} series (FC and ZFC) are shown in Fig. 5. They were taken at 25 Oe with H perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. The broader feature seen in the magnetization for x=0.027 implies a larger inhomogeneity associated with this sample. Indeed, the WDS data for x=0.027 does show local maximum in 2\sigma values. Despite the broader drop of the magnetization, the large superconducting fraction is comparable to the rest of the Pd-doped series as well as to the Co, Ni, and Rh doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} results, all of which are consistent with bulk superconductivity. Again, only a small diamagnetic signal was observed at base temperature for x=0.021 due to the low T_{c} for this concentration.

Figure 6 shows the temperature-dependent heat-capacity data for Ba(Fe_{0.957}Pd_{0.043})_{2}As_{2}, which manifests the highest T_{c} value in this series. The heat-capacity anomaly at T_{c} can be clearly seen, although it is broader than the one found for Ba(Fe_{0.943}Rh_{0.057})_{2}As_{2} (Fig. 3). The arrows show the onset of superconductivity at T_{c}=18 K and the estimated \Delta C_{p} is shown in the inset; \Delta C_{p}\approx 410 mJ/mol K. Using the BCS weak coupling approximation \Delta C_{p}/\gammaT_{c}=1.43 and assuming 100% superconducting volume in this sample, \gamma for Ba(Fe_{0.957}Pd_{0.043})_{2}As_{2} is estimated to be about 16 mJ/mol K^{2}.

## IV Discussion

The data presented in Figs. 1-6 are summarized in the two, T-x, phase diagrams shown in Fig. 7. In this paper, the temperature of structural/magnetic phase transitions are inferred from the derivative of the temperature-dependent resistivity data which shows a split feature for finite values of

  x.[11] The inset to Fig. 7 shows such a d\rho/dT curve as well as the criteria used to determine the upper (structural) transition and the lower (antiferromagnetic) transition temperatures. As shown in Ref. [16] these criteria identify transition temperatures that agree well with the results of neutron- and x-ray diffraction measurements. On- and off-set criteria, which are shown in the inset of Fig. 1, are used to determine T_{c} from the resistivity data. The criterion which is shown in the inset of Fig. 2 is used to determine T_{c} from the magnetization data. The arrows in Fig. 3 show the criterion used to infer T_{c} from heat-capacity data. We can see good agreement between resistivity, magnetization, and heat-capacity measurements. So as to allow comparison with the isoelectronic, 3d electron doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} compounds, data for Ba(Fe_{1-M}_{x})_{2}As_{2} (M = Co, Ni) (Refs. [11] and [17]) are also shown.

The upper panel presents the T-x phase diagrams of Rh and Co doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} and the lower panel presents the T-x phase diagrams of Pd and Ni doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}. It can be seen in both panels that the higher-temperature structural/magnetic phase transitions are suppressed monotonically in a similar manner/rate for all series. Superconductivity is found in both tetragonal and orthorhombic phase,[11, 12, 13, 14] and is stabilized in a domelike region for all series. Superconductivity is found over a wider range of Co or Rh doping with a maximum T_{c} around 24 K, and a narrower range of Ni or Pd doping with a maximum T_{c} around 19 K.

The complete phase diagram of Rh doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} including both structural/magnetic phase transition and superconductivity shows incredible similarity as the phase diagram of Co doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} and the complete phase diagram of Pd doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} shows incredible similarity as the phase diagram of Ni doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}. For each of the pairs, the phase diagrams show exceptionally similar behavior on the rate of the suppression of structural/magnetic phase transitions, the range of superconducting domes and the maximum T_{c}. It is worth mentioning again that to see this, the actual x values are vital. A similar agreement between T_{c}(x) domes for Co/Rh and Ni/Pd has been noted in Sr(Fe_{1-M}_{x})_{2}As_{2}.[23]

In our previous work,[17] we compared the transition temperatures as a function of x, and as a function of the number of extra conduction electrons, e, added by the dopant per Fe/M site for Co, Ni, Cu, and Co/Cu doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (for the case of Co: e=x, for the case of Ni: e=2x). We conclude that whereas the suppression of the structural/antiferromagnetic transitions was parameterized somewhat better by the number of M dopant ions (or, equivalently, changes in the c axis) the superconducting dome was parameterized by the number of electrons added by doping (or, equivalently, changes in the values of the a/c ratio), and exists over a limited range of e values (or band filling). Unfortunately we could not experimentally separate the effects of x and e from changes in c and a/c, respectively.[17] However, with current, 4d-electron doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} data, we can actually distinguish between x and e on one hand and c, a/c on the other. Figure 8 shows the unit-cell parameters normalized by the lattice parameters of pure BaFe_{2}As_{2}. To compare the unit-cell parameters, the data for Co or Ni doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Refs. [11] and [17]) are also plotted in Fig. 8. The lattice parameter c decreases with all dopings and the ratio of a/c increases with all dopings. But in both cases there is a clear difference between the 3d- and 4d-data sets. Unlike in our previous work,[17] where for 3d-electron doping series and c can be scaled with x, and a/c can be scaled with the number of extra electron added per Fe/M site, when 4d-electron doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} data are taken into account, changes in c and a/c are no longer equivalent to x and e. This means that if we want to parameterize the effects of 3d- and 4d-M doping on the transitions temperatures of Ba(Fe_{1-x}_{x})_{2}As_{2}, whereas the upper, structural, and magnetic phase transitions can be parameterized by x and the superconducting dome can be parameterized by e, they are no longer well parameterized

(b) Phase diagrams of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Pd_{x})_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ni_{x})_{2}As_{2} series. For both plots the transition temperatures were determined in a manner similar to that described in Ref. [11] and illustrated in the inset for Ba(Fe_{0.961}Rh_{0.059})_{2}As_{2}. Data for Co and Ni doping are taken from Refs. [11] and [17].

  by either c or a/c. As discussed in Ref. [17], it is still possible that some other parameter, such as bonding angles associated with the As position, offer better or alternate parameterization of these transition temperatures, but these are not currently known.

The parameterization scheme outlined above is based on the premise that a single parameter may be controlling the variation in the upper, structural, and magnetic transition temperatures (T_{s} and T_{m}) and a second one may be controlling the superconductivity (T_{c}). There is another scheme that should be discussed in the context of our growing data set: that there may be a single parameter that controls the behavior of the system when T_{s}\!\sim\!T_{m}\!\!>\!T_{c} and there is another single parameter when T_{s} and T_{m} are fully suppressed. The potential appeal of this scheme can be seen in Fig. 9, where T_{c} is plotted as a function of e and x for comparison. As discussed above and in Ref. [17], there is excellent agreement of the T_{c} values when plotted as a function of e when T_{s} and T_{m} are fully suppressed. On the other hand there is arguably better agreement of the T_{c} values when they are plotted as a function of x for T_{s}\!\sim\!T_{m}\!\!>\!T_{c}. As pointed out in Ref. [17] the behavior on the T_{s}\!\sim\!T_{m}\!\!>\!T_{c} side of the dome may be associated with the need to bring the upper transitions to low enough temperature so as to allow the superconductivity to turn on. The importance of reducing T_{s} and T_{m} may be associated with reducing the degree of orthorhombic splitting, the size of the ordered moment in the AF phase, and/or changing the magnetic excitation spectrum.

Given that T_{s} and T_{m} only roughly scale with x, it is worth while examining the correlation between T_{s}, T_{m}, and T_{c} more directly. Figure 10 plots T_{c} as a function of the structural, as well as the magnetic, transition temperature (given that they are split by the time superconductivity is stabilized).[11, 12, 15, 16]  Both plots show a clear correlation. A more graphic way of examining the correlation between T_{c} and T_{s^{\prime}}/T_{m} is to create a composite diagram for the T_{s}\simT_{m}>T_{c} data by adjusting the x scales for the Ni, Rh, and Pd data so as to collapse the T_{s} and T_{m} phase lines onto the Co data set. This is plotted in Fig. 11. As we can see, a clear consequence of this is to bring collapse the T_{c} data onto a single phase line as well.

## V V. Conclusion

Single crystalline Ba(Fe_{1-x}/M_{x})_{2}As_{2} (M=Rh, Pd) samples have been grown and characterized by microscopic, thermodynamic, and transport measurements. T-x phase diagrams were constructed for both the Rh- and Pd-doping series and, remarkably, they are virtually indistinguishable from the T-x phase diagrams assembled for their 3d-shell counterpart, Co and Ni doped, series. Given that the variations of the unit-cell parameters are distinctly different for the 3d and 4d dopants, these data clearly show that whereas the amount of dopant, x, and the change in electron count, e, do a fair job of parameterizing the structural/magnetic and superconducting phase transitions temperatures, respectively, the variation in the c-axis lattice parameter and the variation in the ratio of the a/c parameters no longer do.

Whereas the structural and magnetic phase transitions are fairly well parameterized by x and, for T_{c}>T_{s}/T_{m}, T_{c} is parameterized by e very well, the T_{c} data for T_{s}\simT_{m}>T_{c} appears to depend on the degree of suppression of T_{s}/T_{m} (and therefore may depend more on x than on e). The fact that the behavior of T_{c} in response to doping appears to change in the vicinity of the disappearance of T_{s}/T_{m} is consistent with recent studies of the T-P phase diagram for BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [24]) as well as earlier work on K doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}.[25] In every case T_{c} appears to reach its maximum value [varying from M, to K, to P (Ref. [26]) doped] when T_{s} and T_{m} are suppressed below T_{c}.
