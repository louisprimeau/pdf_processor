###### Abstract

We report the structural and superconducting evolution of the solid solution of Ir0.95-_x_Rh_x_Te2 (0 \(\leqslant\)\(x\)\(\leqslant\) 0.52) and compare the results with those of analogous selenides. The structural analysis revealed that the unit cell unexpectedly expands and the separation of the Te2-2 dimer exhibits a maximal value of around \(x\) = 0.2 with increasing Rh content. However, unlike the domed _T_c in Ir0.94-_x_Rh_x_Te2, the present system exhibits a monotonous decrease in _T_c, which is independent of the instability of the Te2-2 dimer. As the analysis of resistivity and heat capacity, it is suggested that electron-electron/phonon correlation strength is a considerable factor leading to the different evolution of _T_c in the vicinity of the structural instability state of pyrite superconductors.

## I Introduction

Improving our understanding of the ground state of compounds that contain a heavy transition metal (TM) element has become increasingly desirable due to fascinating properties such as Mott insulator,[1, 2] superconductivity,[3] and spin-orbital coupling.[4, 5, 6] Compared with the spatial extension (_W_) of the orbital of a 3\(d\) TM element, that of 4_d_/5\(d\) electron orbitals should be broader and there should be reduced on-site Coulomb repulsion (_U_). It is known that the group 9 K2NiF4-type oxides exhibit various intrinsic states, e.g., Sr2CoO4 is a ferromagnetic metal, whereas Sr2RhO4 is a simple metal.[7, 8] The analogous 5_d_-Sr2IrO4 is a Mott insulator, and the inherently different ground state could be ascribed to the nontrivial spin-orbital coupling (SOC) induced by the large crystal field effect.[4, 6]

We have previously reported the exotic properties of defective 5_d_-TM pyrite chalcogenides Ir0.75Ch2 (Ch = Se, Te), of which Ir0.75Se2 shows localized insulator behavior.[9] As Ir vacancies are gradually filled by Ir, the unit cell size and the separation of the Se2-2 dimer systemically increases. Simultaneously, the transition from insulator to superconductor occurs, and the superconducting transition temperature (_T_c) monotonically increases to 6.4 K. Furthermore, the 4\(d\) element Rh substitution for Ir leads to the unexpected expansion of the unit cell and the maximal separation of the Se2-2 dimer. The compound Ir0.85Rh0.36Se2 shows the highest _T_c, 9.6 K, which corresponds to the weakest bonding state of the Se2-2 dimer.[10] Meanwhile, the maximal _T_c and the strongest electron-phonon coupling (EPC) emerge in the vicinity of the largest separation of the Se2-2 dimer, which might be correlated with structural instability due to the destabilization of the anion dimers.

The analogous Ir0.75Te2 also could be synthesized at ambient pressure. This material is a metal at the weak-localized state and exhibits superconductivity at 1.8 K.[11] We thought pressure synthesis would be effective to increase the occupancy of Ir and further to stabilize the pyrite phase.[12] As a consequence, the maximal content of Ir could be enhanced to 0.93 for Ir0.93Te2 having the highest _T_c of 4.7 K.[9] The variation of crystallographic parameters and _T_c show similar features to those of the selenides. Nevertheless, the EPC strength of pyrite Ir0.93Te2, judging from the relatively smaller normalized heat-capacity jump, is clearly weaker than that of Ir0.91Se2.[9, 10] It would therefore be of interest to elucidate how crystal structure and superconductivity evolve with 4\(d\) Rh metal substitution in reduced correlated pyrite IrTe2 superconductors.

In this paper, we report the synthesis, structural changes, and superconducting properties of solid-solution Ir0.95-_x_Rh_x_Te2 (0 \(\leqslant\)\(x\)\(\leqslant\) 0.52). The structural analyses indicated that the unit cell continuously expands and the separation of the Te2-2 dimer had a maximum value at the intermediate composition. In contrast to that of Ir0.94-_x_Rh_x_Se2, the _T_c is just suppressed and appears to be irrelevant to the destabilization of the anion Te2-2 dimer. Combined with the heat capacity analysis, the absence of a peak _T_c in the range of the weakest bonding state of the dimer can likely be ascribed to the smaller electron-electron correlated strength of Ir0.95-_x_Rh_x_Te2.

## II Experiment

Highly pure powders of Ir, Rh, and Te were mixed at the desired ratio, pelletized, and placed in an _h_-BN capsule. The assembly was heated at 1573 K and subjected to 5 GPa for 2 h using a belt-type high-pressure and high-temperature apparatus. All starting materials and precursors for the synthesis were prepared in a glove box filled with purified Ar gas (H2O, O2 \(<\) 1 ppm). The phase identification of the resulting samples was carried out by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) using a Bruker diffractometer (model D8 ADVANCE; Cu rotating anode). The Rietveld refinement of the PXRD patterns was performed using the TOPS code.[13] Elemental compositions were determined using an electron-probe microanalyzer (EPMA, JEOL, Inc., model JXA-8530F). The micrometer scale compositions within the main phase were probed on 5 to 10 focal points, and the results were averaged. The dependence of dc electrical resistivity was measured by the conventional four-probe method with a physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). Magnetic measurements were performed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Quantum Design). Specific heat data were obtained using the conventional thermal relaxation method with the PPMS.

 

## III Results and discussion

The EPMA results revealed that the sum of Ir and Rh is \(0.95\pm 0.01\), and thus the formation of vacancies can be negligibly small. The x-ray diffraction patterns of solid solutions could be successfully refined as a pyrite IrTe\({}_{2}\) model. The selected crystallographic parameters of Ir\({}_{0.95-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Te\({}_{2}\) and the sketched crystal structure are shown in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 1(a), the lattice constant and Ir/Rh-Se bond length varied with increasing Rh content. Although the larger Ir\({}^{4+}\) ions were substituted by smaller 4\(d\) Rh\({}^{4+}\) ions, the size of the unit cell increased and then slowly saturated. The maximal lattice constant, 6.4462(3) A, finally approached the reported value of RhTe\({}_{2}\).[14] As regards the separation of the Te\({}_{2}\)\({}^{-2}\) dimer, the value of 2.9695(2) A initially increased, after which it decreased. The maximal distance between dimers emerged at about \(x=0.2\), which indicated that the bonding state of the Te\({}_{2}\)\({}^{-2}\) dimer was at its weakest state and exhibited a behavior similar to that of Ir\({}_{0.95-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Se\({}_{2}\) (see below). Meanwhile, the Ir/Rh-Se bond length showed a similar trend in terms of the variation of the unit cell. The anomaly observed in the intermediate composition suggested that the Ir/Rh-Te bond is strongly affected by the weak bonding state of the Te\({}_{2}\)\({}^{-2}\) dimer. This complex structural change indicated that the dominant factor in lattice variation may not be the size of the transition element, but rather the geometry and polarization of the TMCh\({}_{6}\) polyhedral in a pyrite structure.[15]

Figure 2 shows the electrical transport properties of Ir\({}_{0.95-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Te\({}_{2}\) from 2 to 300 K. As shown in Fig. 2(a), all samples exhibited metallic behavior, and the small hump observed at moderate temperatures quickly disappeared upon substitution of Rh for Ir. It is reported that a hump at 350 K for Ir\({}_{0.75}\)Te\({}_{2}\) was identified as the structural transition from cubic lattice to rhombohedral lattice, which in general changed the distortion of the IrTe\({}_{6}\) polyhedra.[11] Provided that two types of humps have the same origin, it seems that Ir-filled and Rh doping could suppress the phase transition, which might be involved with the larger distortion of IrTe\({}_{6}\) polyhedral geometry and the enhanced charge fluctuation.[9] Within the lower temperature range, the resistivity of all samples suddenly decreased to zero. The detailed superconducting transition is shown in Fig. 2(b). The \(T_{c}\) monotonously decreased with increasing Rh content, and the lowest \(T_{c}\) under the present limitations was 2.4 K for Ir\({}_{0.43}\)Rh\({}_{0.52}\)Te\({}_{2}\). The interpolated \(T_{c}\) of RhTe\({}_{2}\) was 1.3 K, i.e., almost consistent with the reported value of 1.5 K.[14] In addition, the power-law equation \(\rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}\), where \(\rho_{0}\) is residual resistivity and \(A\) is constant, could be applied to fit the normal-state resistivity below 50 K. The rhodium composition dependence of the obtained value \(n\) is plotted in Fig. 2(c). The value of \(n\) increased from 1.6 to 2 for \(x=0.2\), which indicated that the system might evolve into a Fermi-liquid metal. As \(x>0.2\), the normal-state resistivity behavior did not show any distinct changes. It should be noted that Fermi-liquid behavior emerged at \(x=0.2\), precisely where the separation of the Te\({}_{2}\)\({}^{-2}\) dimer also exhibited the largest value. In contrast to the domed \(T_{c}\) and \(T\)-linear resistivity in Ir\({}_{0.94-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Se\({}_{2}\), the present superconducting properties displayed differing Rh-substitution dependency, in spite of the fact that both systems possess similar crystallographic properties.

The magnetic properties and specific heat (SH) at low temperatures are shown in Fig. 3. The upper panel reveals that there were large diamagnetic signals, indicating the bulk superconductivity nature for all samples. We can see that the \(T_{c}\) monotonously decreases as Rh substitution increases. The presence of hysteresis between zero field cooling and field cooling indicates that the materials are type-II superconductors. The lower panel shows the SH data for selected samples with values of \(x=0.2\), 0.27, and 0.42 plotted as

 \(C_{p}/T\) versus \(T^{2}\). Here, the temperature associated with the distinct jump in \(C_{p}/T\) coincided with the electrical and magnetic data. The SH data in the low-temperature range could be well fitted by \(C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4}\), which in turn means that the influence of high frequency acoustic phonon branches is more significant than those of selenides. The fitted curves yielded the Sommerfeld electronic coefficients \(\gamma=7.66\), \(7.79\), and \(8.77\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) for \(x=0.2\), \(0.27\), and \(0.42\), respectively, which showed only slight increments in the samples with higher \(T_{c}\). The Debye temperatures calculated from the equation \(\Theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}nR/5\beta)^{1/3}\), where \(n\) is the number of atoms per formula unit and \(R\) is the gas constant, were \(260\), \(257\), and \(330\) K for three samples, respectively. Referring to the \(\Theta_{D}\) (\(263\) K) for IrTe\({}_{2}\), the present variation in the Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}\) was similar to that of Ir\({}_{0.94-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Se\({}_{2}\). In other words, with lower-content Rh substitution, the Debye temperature changed slightly and reached the smallest value for Ir\({}_{0.68}\)Rh\({}_{0.27}\)Te\({}_{2}\) when the bonding of the Te\({}_{2}\)\({}^{2-}\) dimer was weakest. With higher Rh contents, the Debye temperature markedly increased once again. It was also noted that the normalized heat capacity jumped at \(T_{c}\), \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\), and monotonously decreased from \(2\) to \(1.3\) for Ir\({}_{0.53}\)Rh\({}_{0.42}\)Te\({}_{2}\), which implies that the EPC strength transits from an intermediate to a weak coupling state. As previously reported, at the weakest bonding state of the Se\({}_{2}\)\({}^{2-}\) dimer, the peak value of \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\) was \(3.53\) and \(T\)-linear resistivity appeared, thus indicating stronger EPC and electron-electron correlation strength in the selenide system than in the present telluride system.[10]

The composition dependencies of the calculated Debye temperature and superconducting parameters are summarized in Fig. 4. Interestingly, the EPC state appeared to exhibit behavior similar to that of the decreasing \(T_{c}\). Likewise, the larger \(\gamma\) in the lower-\(T_{c}\) sample is also unusual, and it implies that EPC strength governs the \(T_{c}\) and EPC strength decreases with increasing Rh content. Moreover, this consistency has also been reported in the analogous Ir\({}_{0.94-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Se\({}_{2}\). Actually, density functional theory (DFT) and phonon spectrum calculations on tellurium[16] and BaSi\({}_{2}\)[17] have pointed out that the increase in \(T_{c}\) is closely correlated with an enhancement of EPC strength due to the emergence of the soft phonon mode.

In addition, the smallest value of \(\Theta_{D}\) emerges at the weakest bonding state of Te\({}_{2}\)\({}^{2-}\) dimers, which has been observed in BaNi\({}_{2}\)(Ge\({}_{1-x}\)P\({}_{x}\)) systems.[18] Such critical behavior usually implies phonon softening within the range of structural instability or transition.[18; 19] However, there seems to be a lack of rigid correspondence between the critical nature of the separation of the anion dimer, \(\Theta_{D}\) and \(T_{c}\). Taking into account the competition of Hubbard repulsion \(U\) and the SOC scenario presented by Pesin and Belents,[5] we considered that the parent Ir\({}_{0.75}\)Se\({}_{2}\) locates the boundary of the Mott insulator

(b) The total heat capacity divided by \(T\) as a function of temperature squared for \(x=0.2\), \(027\), and \(0.42\) at \(H=0\) KOe.

  phase, while Ir\({}_{0.75}\)Te\({}_{2}\) would cross into the metal regime, due to the reduced \(U\), provided the SOC does not change substantially. Based on previous DFT calculations of selenide, the Fermi energy is dominated by the strong hybridization of the Ir/Rh-\(d\) and Se-4\(p\) orbitals.[9; 10] Therefore, the more spatially spread Te 5\(p\) orbital could increase the bandwidth and weaken the electron-electron correlation in Ir\({}_{0.95-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Te\({}_{2}\), as reflected by the conventional Fermi-liquid metallic behavior and reduced EPC in the intermediate composition. Although the softest phonon mode may emerge in the range of the weakest bonding of Te\({}_{2}\)\({}^{2-}\) dimers, the relative smaller EPC may still not suffice to induce a peak \(T_{c}\) in weakly metallic telluride superconductors.

Here, we investigated the structural and superconducting properties of solid solutions of Ir\({}_{0.95-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)Te\({}_{2}\). Comparison study demonstrates that pyrite IrCh\({}_{2}\) (Ch = Se, Te) superconductors share common features with respect to structural changes and the destabilization of the Ch\({}_{2}\)\({}^{2-}\) dimer as Rh is substituted for Ir. However, the absence of a domed \(T_{c}\) implies that the degree of electron-electron correlation and EPC strength may be predominant comparing with the instability of the anion dimer in the evolution of superconductivity. Additional phonon spectrum calculations will be needed to clarify the contrasting behaviors of these systems.
