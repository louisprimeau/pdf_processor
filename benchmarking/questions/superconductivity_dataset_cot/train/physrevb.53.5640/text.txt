###### Abstract

Superconducting energy gap in _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (_R_ = Y and Lu) has been investigated using a break-junction tunneling technique. The observed differential conductance _dI/dV_ is well described by the BCS density of states with a small lifetime broadening parameter. We have found small gap values for the local low-_T_c phases in addition to the bulk _T_c of 15.6\(-\)16.6 K. The gap value of 2A = 4.5 meV with _T_c = 15 K gives the BCS ratio of 22_k_/_k_B_T_c = 3.5, which is kept constant down to the observed lowest _T_c of 4.6 K. These results give clear evidence for the BCS mechanism of superconductivity for these compounds.

## Introduction

The appearance of superconducting quaternary intermetallic borocarbides _RT_2B2C (_R_ = rare earth, \(T\) = transition metal) has offered an opportunity to explore the research field of intermetallic high-temperature superconductors, in addition to the copper and noncopper oxides, and metal-doped fullerene solids.[1, 2]_R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C contains a 3_d_-transition-metal Ni, which would imply strong electron correlations, light-mass elements B and C, and Ni2B2 layers stacking alternately with _R_C planes.[3] These characteristics somewhat resemble those of the copper oxide superconductors. Therefore it is interesting to have insight into the superconductivity mechanism of this compound. The superconducting transition temperature _T_c of _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C varies from 7.5 K (_R_ = Ho) to the highest value of 16.6 K (_R_ = Lu) among the Ni borocarbimetallics.[2] More significantly, a high _T_c of ~22-23 K has been found in both YPd2B2C (Ref. [4]) and Th-Pd-B-C (Ref. [5]), the value of which is higher than any other intermetallic compounds. The _T_c of these compounds are comparable to those for the other well-known strong-coupling high-_T_c intermetallic \(A\) 15 superconductors.[6] The _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C compound possesses the electronic specific-heat coefficient \(g\) of 20\(-\)35 mJ/mol K.[7]\({}^{\mathrm{3}}\) which is the same magnitude as those for the \(A\) 15 compounds. The upper critical field _H_c2  10 T for _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C is much lower than 20\(-\)40 T for the \(A\) 15 compounds.[8] The origin of the relatively large \(g\) values of _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C favorable to a high _T_c is mainly due to the narrow and large Ni 3\(d\) electronic states near _E_F_.[9, 10] The values of the coherence length \(g\) 5 5 nm and the mean free path \(l\) ~70 nm indicate a clean-limit superconductivity.[8] While the superconductivity in _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C has been suggested to be strong coupling,[7, 9] preliminary results of tunneling and Andreev reflection measurements showed weak-coupling BCS characteristics.[11, 12, 13] Furthermore, both a band-structure calculation[10] and an isotope experiment[14] showed that the high-energy optical phonons involving B atoms play an important role for the occurrence of superconductivity. Especially, the band-structure calculation pointed out a secondary role of Ni 3\(d\) electrons as strongly correlated states, thus suggesting a conventional superconductivity of these compounds.

In this paper we explore the energy gap of _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C (_R_ = Y,Lu) using tunneling spectroscopy to clarify the nature of this class of superconductivity. The tunneling technique is indispensable to observe the quasiparticle energy gap directly,[15] thereby enabling us to make a straightforward comparison with that of the other intermetallics such as \(A\) 15 (Ref. [6]) and the Cheverl compounds,[16] as well as copper and noncopper oxide superconductors.[17]

## Experimental details

The crystal structure of _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C is a filled version of the tetragonal-body-centered ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) type (an ordered variant of the BaAl\({}_{4}\) type).[2] The compounds with this structure have played an important role for exploring the heavy Fermion physics.[18] Polycrystalline samples were prepared by arc melting under Ar gas and annealed in a vacuum-sealed quartz tube at 1100 degC for 35 h. The susceptibility measurements using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer indicate that the sample of YNi\({}_{2}\)B2C cooled in zero field showed perfect diamagnetism, while on cooling it in a field of 10 Oe a Meissner volume fraction of 27% was obtained. For LuNi\({}_{2}\)B2C, 22% of perfect diamagnetism was obtained for zero-field cooling. The onset _T_c was 15.6 and 16.6 K for \(R\) = Y and Lu, respectively. The widths of _T_c obtained from the volume fraction of 10\(-\)90% to the saturated diamagnetism were approximately 2.3 K (_R_ = Y) and 0.7 K (_R_ = Lu). The latter exhibits a much sharper transition than the former in spite of the smaller volume fraction. Tunneling measurements were carried out using break junctions that are believed to provide a fresh and unaffected interface.[12, 19] A polycrystalline sample having a cross section of approximately 1.5\(\times\)0.5 mm\({}^{\mathrm{2}}\) was mounted on a flexible substrate to crack under liquid-helium temperature by applying adjustable bending force, and then the cracked sample pieces were brought together by releasing the bending force until the tunneling current was able to be detected. The differential conductance _dI/dV_ of the current (_I_)-voltage (_V_) characteristics was directly obtained by an ac modulation technique using a four-probe method.

  

## Results and Discussion

For the break-junction geometry, a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) tunneling is expected for cracking the sample at intragrains. In this case, the gap value of 4D would be obtained. However, a gap of 2D from the superconductor-insulator-normal (SIN) tunneling was also often observed in our measurements. This is probably because the sample is cracked at grain boundaries and one side of the interface region is in the normal state. For the polycrystalline samples, the grain boundaries may be brittle and chemically complex because their compositions are different from the main phase of _R_Ni2B2C. This would explain why the cracking often occurs at grain boundaries. Furthermore, we have obtained several small gap values corresponding to low-_T__c_ phases in numbers of the tunnel junctions, which is probably due to local variations in compositions. It should be noted, however, that the x-ray- diffraction data showed a single phase and no secondary phase was evident in the SQUID data for the samples used in the present measurements. Therefore we speculate that such low-_T__c_ phases are mainly located along the grain boundaries that are extended in the whole sample, but are a very small amount. The distributed gap feature observed here allowed us to investigate the \(T_{c}\) dependence of the gap value. The local \(T_{c}\) distributions were also manifested in the NMR and specific-heat measurements which could probe the low-energy quasiparticle excitations.[7, 20] Notice that these features somewhat resemble the case of ThCr2Si2-type polycrystalline compounds, where a microprobe analysis clarified the existence of a secondary phase at the grain boundaries, even if the x-ray-diffraction data showed a single phase.[21] Such a small stoichiometric variation often would cause a drastic change in the electronic properties.[22]

For interpreting the observed spectra, density-of-states fitting procedures should be performed to distinguish between the SIS and SIN tunnelings. Among several fitting functions,[17] the lifetime-broadened BCS densities of states[23] with thermal smearing were found to fit well to the most of the experimental data with a small broadening parameter for the SIS junction and slightly larger value for the SIN case. We consider that the above difference is most likely due to the difference in the surface quality, which is higher for intragrain cracking of the SIS tunneling than that for intergrain one of the SIN case.

Figure 1(a) shows the tunneling conductance _d1/dV_ for a LuNi2B2C break junction. The conductance curve quite resembles that of the SIS junction of the standard BCS superconductor with no Josephson supercurrent. The junction resistance of \(R_{j}\) =54 k\(\Omega\) at the gap edge of 4.5 mV and the critical current density \(J_{c}\) = 105-106 A/cm2 (Ref. [24]) give the possible smallest effective junction area that retains superconductivity to be ~10-10-11 mm2. This is significantly smaller than the nominal junction area of ~1 mm2. However, from the sharpness of the gap-edge peaks and absence of the Josephson current, the high \(R_{j}\) value here can be due to a thicker insulating barrier where the actual current density should be low enough. Therefore the junction area would be much larger than the estimated value.

We compare the experimental data with the calculated tunneling density of states for the SIS junction,[15]

\[dI(V)/dV = d\left[ {C\int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty} \!N(E,\Gamma )N(E + eV,\Gamma )[ f(E) - f(E + eV)]} \right] \right \! high barrier transparency at the junction interface. The subgap structures of (2D_ph-_fp_/_e_)/_n_ (_n_ = 2,3) observed in Fig. 2 give evidence for the multiparticle (_n_-particle) tunneling and/or the multiple Andreev reflection processes for the SIS junction, which are absent in the SIN junction. [26-28]

As mentioned above, we have often observed the smaller D_ph-_fp_ values. The observed smallest sharp-gap structures are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, together with the _I_-_V_ characteristics. These structures are due to the SIS gap because they are much sharper than the ideal BCS singularity expected for the SIN tunneling. In Fig. 3, the gap-edge peaks occur at +2D_ph-_fp_/_e_ = +-2.8 mV and the weak humps at +-1.4 mV correspond to +-D_ph-_fp_. On the other hand, the tunneling conductance of Fig. 4 possesses 4D_ph-_fp_ = 3.2 meV with the smooth conductance feature inside the gap voltage. In particular, a flat region observed around zero bias cannot be reproduced by the calculation using Eqs. (1) and (2) even if we put \(\Gamma\)=0 meV. In Figs. 3 and 4, there are no conductance dips owing to a proximity effect unlike the cases of Figs. 1 and 2. Such dips were also not observed for the smaller-gap structures in the present measurements as shown in Figs. 5, 9, 13, and 14, presumably reflecting the difference in the characteristics of the interface regions of the junction between the bulk and other phases.

It is noted that in the sharp-gap structure the phonon excitations would be observable above the gap energy for the strong-coupling superconductors. [6,15] In fact, using the break junction, we have observed clear phonon structures in Pb at the correct energies. However, in Figs. 3 and 4 such structures are not observed within a resolution of an at least >0.1-0.5% change of the conductance above the gap voltage. This is consistent with the weak-coupling nature where the phonon structures would be hardly observed. This situation is similar to the case of Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)BiO\({}_{3}\) (2D/_k_B_T_c = 3.5),

  in which the phonon structures were observed only very weakly.[29] the measurement beyond \(\pm\)20 mV would be desirable to clarify the contribution of high-energy phonons as was suggested by an isotope-effect measurement and the band-structure calculation.[10, 34]

Figure 5(a) shows the tunneling conductance from an YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C SIS junction, where the large zero-bias peak as well as the peaks at \(\pm\)2.2 mV are evident. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the observed tunneling conductance, except the zero-bias peak, is well described by the SIS model using Eqs. (1) and (2) for \(T\)=4.2 K, \(\Delta\)=1.10 meV, and \(\Gamma\)=0.11 meV. The zero-bias features are largely different from each other, but the intensive peak in the experimental curve is partly reproduced by the calculation. This is due to a finite tunneling probability of the quasiparticles between the subgap states of opposing electrodes, which are induced by \(\Gamma\) and \(T\) even at thermal equilibrium (i.e., \(V\)=0). The remaining component of the observed zero-bias peak probably comes from a Josephson or weak-link supercurrent. Notice that the broadened feature in Fig. 5 (\(\Gamma\)/\(\Delta\)=0.1) is similar to that for Fig. 1 (\(\approx\)0.08).

In Fig. 6, the high-bias feature of the tunneling conductance of Fig. 3 is presented with the bias voltages extended up to \(\pm\)320 mV. The background conductance above \(\pm\)\(\Delta\)/\(e\) is symmetric with respect to zero bias, having the total change of it about 70-80% at \(\pm\)320 mV. Assuming that the heating effect of the junction is negligible because of the relatively high \(R_{J}\) of 3-6 k\(\Omega\) and the smoothly increasing conductance with increasing bias voltage, we have fitted the simple tunneling model with a rectangular barrier at 0 K to the conductance of Fig. 6,[15]

  \[dI(V)/dV = C(U_{B} - eV/2)^{1/2}t^{-1}\,\cosh[(m/2)^{1/2}\hbar^{-1}etV(U_{B}\] (3) \[- eV/2)^{-1/2}],\]

where \(U_{B}\) and \(t\) are the barrier height and thickness, respectively. Equation (3) tells us that the thicker (thinner) barrier results in the stronger (weaker) bias dependence for the constant \(U_{B}\). The experimental data do not exhibit a simple parabolic shape expected from Eq. (3) for \(eV \ll U_{B}\), but we were able to choose the appropriate values of \(U_{B}\)=5 eV and \(t = 0.7\) nm to explain the bias dependence of the background conductance, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The relatively large value of \(U_{B}\) for a mechanically stable junction as in this case suggests the formation of an insulating material barrier rather than the vacuum barrier.

For evaluating the ratio \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}\) from the distributed gap values presented in Figs. 1-5, it is necessary to obtain \(T_{c}\) by measuring the temperature dependence of the tunneling conductance itself. Although the break junction had been considered to be unstable against temperature change, we were able to obtain the available data. An example of the temperature variations of \(dII/dV\) from an YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C SIS junction is displayed in Fig. 7 with \(4\Delta_{\text{p-p}}\)=8.1 meV at 4.2 K. The asymmetric background conductance is evident at low temperatures, and the \(R_{J}\) at high-bias voltages are almost of the same magnitude as that in Fig. 1. With increasing temperature the \(R_{J}\) slightly changes at about 5 K, thereby resulting in the drastic change of the conductance curve where the flat background conductance and the large zero-bias peak appear with shoulderlike peaks at \(\pm\)1 mV. The origin of the zero-bias peak is probably due to the Josephson supercurrent and/or leak current through a weak link.[27] The subgap peaks at \(\pm\)1 mV above 5 K can be due to \(\pm(\Delta_{\text{p-p}}/e)/2\) of the multiple Andreev reflections between two superconductors, which are expected to be intensive for the weak-link junction.[28] As shown in Fig. 7, the intensities of both the zero-bias peak and the peaks of \(\pm 2\Delta_{\text{p-p}}/e = \pm 3.8-3.9\) mV at 5 K smoothly decrease with increasing temperature. In par

  ticular, the gap peak positions shifting to low energies are clearly observed because of the crossing of density-of-states singularities between the opposing electrodes. They are well defined up to \(T_{c}\) , as is expected for the ideal SIS tunneling.[15]

Figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of \(4\Delta_{\rm p\

 value may not be a surface artifact. It may be related to the polycrystal grains and/or inhomogeneity, where the electrons have possibilities to go out or in between the superconducting and normal states through the grain boundaries. This would result in a finite lifetime of the quasiparticles in the superconducting state. The larger \(\Gamma\) values for the SIN tunneling than that for the SIS case as shown in Figs. 1, 5, and 11 can be explained by the much degradated junction-interface characteristics consisting of grain boundaries for the SIN junction compared to the cracked junction interface for the SIS junction.

The fitting results like in Fig. 11 demonstrate that the anisotropic gap is not the case for the \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound, because all the gap features are well described by only the \(\Gamma\) term and the probability-distribution function of the gaps is not needed.[17] The above results are therefore consistent with the nearly isotropic electronic properties of \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.[30] This feature is in contrast with, for example, the cuprate superconductivity with CuO\({}_{2}\) layers, where the Gaussian gap-distribution model often describes the observed gap broadening.[17]

In Fig. 12, the values of \(\Delta\) from the above fitting procedures are plotted as a function of temperature, where the BCS temperature dependence of \(\Delta\) is clearly visible. It is noted that \(\Gamma\) is almost constant or slightly increases with increasing temperature, probably reflecting the fact that the interface characteristics do not depend on temperature. Since \(\Gamma\) is the only parameter which describes the zero-bias conductance for the given \(\Delta\) and \(T\), we have calculated the temperature dependence of \(dI/dV(0\ {\rm mV})\) with \(\Gamma\). The best fit to the experimental data in a whole temperature range is obtained for \(\Gamma\) = 0.23 meV (=2.7 K) as shown by the solid line in Fig. 10. From Figs. 8 and 12, it is obvious that the sharp gap-peak positions for the SIS tunneling (Fig. 8) and the conductance-fitted gap values for the SIN tunneling (Fig. 12) actually match with the BCS temperature dependence. This feature is in contrast to the results of specific-heat and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation measurements, which suggest a deviation from the simple BCS picture.[7, 20]

In the present work, we have probed much smaller gap values than that corresponding to the bulk \(T_{c}\) of \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. Figure 13 shows such data for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with the temperature variations of \(dI/dV\) having \(\epsilon\)_V_\({}_{\rm p\mbox  \(\Delta\) (_t_ =0) \(\rightleftharpoons\)\(\Delta_{\Phi\text{-}\Phi}\) (_t_ =0.63) is obtained. Therefore 2\(\Delta\) would become \(\approx\)4 meV at 0 K, thereby giving the ratio 2\(\Delta\)/_k__B__T__c_ = 3.5.

Further, we have found a considerably low \(T_{c}\) of 4.6 K for a LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C junction. While the Ni-site substitution on YNi\({}_{2-x}\)\({}_{T}\)B\({}_{2}\)C [\(T\) = Co (x = 0.1), Fe (x = 0.07), Ru] showed a decrease in \(T_{c}\) down to about 6 K,32 the _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound with the bulk \(T_{c}\) < 5 K has not yet been reported. In the present work, we use the lowest-_T__c_ phase to probe the smallest gap size just before causing the superconducting phase to disappear in this compound. Figure 14 shows the temperature variations of _dI_/_dV_ having the _eV__P_-p-p = 3.2 meV at 4.2 K. This value roughly agrees with that in Fig. 4, but the measuring temperature is different. In Fig. 14, mechanical instability of the junction did not allow us to measure the spectra below 4.2 K. The gap structure is rapidly smeared out on warming up to 5 K, but it is fairly well pronounced even at 4.2 K. The \(T_{c}\) = 4.6 K is obtained from the temperature dependence of the zero-bias conductance _dI_/_dV_(0 mV) as shown in Fig. 15, where the onset of the gap opening is clearly seen. The temperature dependence of the _dI_/_dV_(0 mV) for the SIN junction calculated using the ideal BCS density of states is also presented in the figure. Since the experimental data are always below the ideal characteristics for the SIN tunneling given by the calculation, they are apparently due to the SIS tunneling. The tunneling conductance with the different \(R_{j}\) as shown in the bottom of Fig. 14 gives further evidence for the SIS gap. It displays the broad humps around \(\pm\)_V_p-p/4 = \(\pm\)\(\Delta_{\Phi\text{-}\Phi}\)/_e_, in addition to \(\pm\)2\(\Delta_{\Phi\text{-}\Phi}\)/_e_. Because of the SIS tunneling, the gap structure is well defined even at 4.2 K (_t_ = 0.91). For temperatures up to 4.56 K (_t_ = 0.99), the broadened gap feature at \(\pm\)2\(\Delta_{\Phi\text{-}\Phi}\)/_e_ = \(\pm\)1.6 mV shows no temperature shift, being similar to the case of Fig. 13. Although the gap feature is simply broadened with the constant background conductance, the fitting results using Eq. (1) were not satisfactory. Therefore, by considering the temperature broadening of the gap edge that results in a constant _V_p-p, on warming as discussed in Fig. 13, the gap value of 2\(\Delta\)=1.2-1.4 meV at 0 K would be obtained from the 2\(\Delta_{\Phi\text{-}\Phi}\)=1.6 meV multiplied by the empirical factor of \(\approx\)0.8-0.9.17 This leads to the ratio 2\(\Delta\)/_k__B__T__c_ = 3.1-3.5, which is consistent with that for the higher-_T__c_ phase in _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.

Footnote 17: The \(T_{c}\) = 4.6 K is also found to be consistent with the \(T_{c}\) = 4.2 K.

From the measurements of the temperature dependence of the tunneling conductance as shown in Figs. 7, 9, 13, and 14, it is obvious that the distribution of the gap value is due to the \(T_{c}\) difference probably arising from local variations of stoichiometry. Such features have also been found in the cuprate single crystals, which have been preventing us from obtaining the intrinsic properties of the tunneling spectra.17

Footnote 17: The \(T_{c}\) = 4.2 K is also found to be consistent with the \(T_{c}\) = 4.2 K.

We have occasionally observed the large gap feature of _eV__p-p = 18 meV at 4.2 K in YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C as shown in Fig. 16. The background conductance is asymmetric and strongly bias dependent, but the subgap conductance is well decreased with the substantial overshoots at the gap edges that are much broadened. The value of \(R_{j}\) \(\approx\)50 k\(\Omega\) at \(\pm\)20 mV is

  similar to that of the other data in the present work, and the positions of the gap structures were reproducible for the different junctions with \(R_{J}\) (\(\pm\)20 mV) up to \(\sim\)400 k\(\Omega\). Therefore this is considered to be due to the superconducting gap, and the possibility of observing the nonintrinsic effect such as a Coulomb blockade can be excluded, although the conservation of the areas below and above the gap energies seems to be difficult to confirm because of the strongly bias-dependent background-conductance feature. Since \(eV_{\rm p\sim p}\)=18 meV is twice as large as 4\(\Delta_{\rm p\sim p}\)/\(e\) of Fig. 1, it can be primarily due to double SIS tunneling. Within this interpretation, the ratio 2\(\Delta_{\rm p\sim p}\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\)\(\sim\)3.5 is obtained with a bulk \(T_{c}\) of about 15 K. We note that the existence of the higher-\(T_{c}\) phase as was found in YPd\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (Ref. [4]) also cannot be ruled out as the origin of the large gap value, because tunneling spectroscopy could probe local quasiparticle excitations very sensitively. This is supported by the observation of the low-\(T_{c}\) gaps as is already presented in this work.

In contrast to the present results of the BCS gap size in \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, deviations from BCS behavior have been discussed in some reports.[79, 20] From the normalized specific-heat discontinuity of \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\)\(\sim\)1.6\(-\)1.8 reported by Carter _et al._,[7] which is larger than the BCS value of 1.43, the ratio 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\)\(\sim\)3.7\(-\)3.9 is obtained using \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\)\(\sim\)0.115(2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\)).[33] This result points to an intermediate-to-strongly coupled superconductivity. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the electronic contribution to the specific heat (\(C_{e}\)) in the superconducting states for \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C by Hong _et al._ seems to obey a power law with \(C_{e}\)/\(\gamma T_{c}\)\(\approx\)\(t\)\(\approx\)\(t\)\(\approx\)\(t\).[75], rather than the BCS activation formula \(C_{e}\)/\(\gamma T_{c}\)\(\sim\)8.5\(\exp[-0.82\Delta(0)/k_{B}T]\) at low temperatures of \(t\)\(<\)0.3. The temperature dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/\(T_{1}\) of \({}^{11}\)B showed no enhancement just below \(T_{c}\) with the magnetic field down to 0.4 T, and its temperature dependence seems to be consistent with a power law rather than the BCS activation type.[20] These results are not consistent with the present tunneling measurements. However, we believe that the above results are due to local variations of stoichiometry or normal-state impurities which would cause low-energy quasiparticle excitations as a result of pair breaking.

There exists a calculation that predicts the existence of high-energy phonons to give the estimation of a large electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda\) (up to 2.6).[9] The large \(\lambda\) value implies low-energy phonons which would be caused by a softening of the \(B\) phonon mode or the phonons from heavy ions.[9] Such a strong electron-phonon interaction (\(\lambda\)\(>\)1\(-\)1.5) would result in the ratio 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\)\(\approx\)\(t\)\(\sim\)4\(-\)4.6, where the structures of the electron-phonon interaction must be observable above the gap energies in the tunneling conductance with about 2\(-\)3 % deviations from the BCS density of states, as is seen for Pb and \(A\) 15 compounds.[6, 15] However, the above prediction of a large \(\lambda\) is also not consistent with our tunneling results of a weak-coupling superconductivity, as well as no phonon structures in the tunneling data. It is, therefore, of practical interest to compare \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with other strong-coupling intermetallic \(A\) 15 compounds like Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn using the same experimental technique. Preliminary results of our break-junction measurements have given the results of 2\(\Delta\)=6.7 meV at 4.2 K with \(T_{c}\)=17.3 K of the junction, thereby giving a strong-coupling value of 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\)=4.5.[34] This value agrees well with the literature[6] and clearly distinguishes Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn from \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C in spite of having the similar \(T_{c}\)=15\(-\)17 K. It is noted that the Chevrel-phase compounds with \(T_{c}\)=10\(-\)12 K have been also reported to be very strong-coupling superconductors with 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\)=4\(-\)5,[16] but by taking into account the broadening feature of the tunneling spectra,[17] the ratio is turned out to fall into a weak-to-moderate coupling regime of 3.5\(-\)3.8. This is rather in agreement with that of \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C than Nb\({}_{3}\)Sn. Note here that the \(\gamma\) value of \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is similar to that of the \(A\) 15 compounds, but is smaller than that of the Chevrel compounds.[8]

We here briefly mention the present results of 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\)=3.5 obtained for \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. The BCS gap value for a wide \(T_{c}\) range of 5\(-\)16 K for \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is similar to that for Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)BiO\({}_{3}\) throughout \(T_{c}\)=15\(-\)30 K.[29] This is in contrast to the case of the intermetallic \(A\) 15 compounds Nb\({}_{3}\)Ge where 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\) increases rapidly from the value slightly below 3.5 (\(T_{c}\)=7\(-\)12.6 K) to a strong-coupling value of 4.3\(-\)4.5 at the stoichiometric phase boundary (\(T_{c}\)=21.2 K).[6] From the semiempirical formula of the strong-coupling correction for 2\(\Delta\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\) given by Mitrovic _et al.[35]_ using the Eliashberg equations

\[2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} = 3.5[1+12.5(k_{B}T_{c}/E_{\rm in})^{2}\,\ln(E_{\rm in}/2k_{B}T_{c})]\] (5) \[\mbox{for}\,\,\,\,k_{B}T_{c}/E_{\rm in}\!\!<\!0.3\,\mbox{$\rangle$},\]

with

\[E_{\rm in}\!\!=\!\exp\!\left[(2\Delta)\int F(E)(\ln E/E)dE\right]\]

[\(F(E)\) is the phonon density of states]  and SQUID measurements. With the aid of this characteristic, the \(T_{c}\) dependence of the gap is obtained. The ratio \(2\lambda/k_{B}T_{c}\) = 3.5 is found to be kept constant with changes in \(T_{c}\) from 4.6-15 K, indicating a weak-coupling, BCS, superconductivity for \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. We were not able to obtain clear evidence for the electron-phonon interaction in the tunneling spectra, even if we succeeded in obtaining the very-sharp-gap structures. Measurements using single crystals will be needed to explore this issue further.
