###### Abstract

We investigate the resistivity and thermoelectric power properties for
Co- or K-doped BaFe₂As₂ systems. T_(c) as a function of Co- or K-doping
level exhibits a domelike behavior in both of the systems. The
thermoelectric power (S) at room temperature as a function of doping
level (x) shows a domelike behavior in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ system
while monotonously decreases in BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ system. It is
intriguing that the superconducting samples simultaneously show large
absolute values of thermoelectric power and good conductivity. The power
factor shows a peak at low temperature, suggesting possible applications
in thermoelectric cooling modules around the liquid-nitrogen temperature
range.

## I Introduction

Thermoelectric properties of solids have long been a fundamental issue
in condensed-matter physics and are currently attracting renewed
interest because of the possibility of practical application, such as
coolers (Peltier effect) and generators (Seebeck effect). The measure of
their performance is the thermoelectric figure-of-merit Z which is
defined as S²σ/κ, where S is the thermoelectric power, σ and κ are the
electronic conductivity and thermal conductivity, respectively. The
power factor is defined as P=S²σ. The most urgent need for
thermoelectric applications is to find new thermoelectric materials with
high ZT values around the room temperature. ZT>1 is one of the criteria
for practical application, although only a few semiconductors, e.g.,
bismuth-antimony telluride and bismuth-antimony alloys,[1] have been
known to satisfy the condition. Recently, some 3d transition-metal
oxides have drawn attention as a new category of thermoelectric
materials. For example, a large Seebeck coefficient is observed at room
temperature in the metallic cobalt oxide, Na_(x)CoO₂.[2] This cobalt
oxide has heavy effective mass of carriers due to the strong
electron-electron correlation,[3] which is responsible for the large
Seebeck coefficient as in some 4f heavy-fermion systems.[4]

Recently, large thermoelectric power has also been discovered in iron
oxypnictides. Such iron oxypnictides are of ThCr₂Si₂-type structure.
They adopt a layered structure with Fe layers sandwiched by two As
layers with each Fe is coordinated by As tetrahedron. Similar to the
cuprates, superconductivity occurs through electron or hole doping into
an antiferromagnetic parent compound. Recently, the ternary iron
arsenide BaFe₂As₂ shows superconductivity at 38 K by hole doping with
partial substitution of K for Ba.[5, 6] In contrast to high-T_(c)
cuprates, superconductivity can also be induced by partial substitution
on Fe sites in the conducting layers by other transition-metal elements
such as Co (Refs. 7-9) and Ni (Ref. 10) in the 1111 and 122 phases, and
the measurements of Hall effect and thermoelectric power indicate that
the electron-type charge carriers dominate in the Co-doped case.

In this paper, we report the resistivity and thermoelectric power for
Co- or K-doped BaFe₂As₂ system. Thermoelectric power measurements show
large thermoelectric power in these two kinds of materials. This leads
to promising thermoelectric power factors that could enable potential
application of these materials in thermoelectric cooling modules around
liquid-nitrogen temperatures. T_(c) as a function of K- or Co-doping
level exhibits a domelike behavior. S(300 K) as a function of doping
level (x) also shows a domelike behavior in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ system
while monotonously decreases in BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ system.

## II Materials and Methods

A series of polycrystalline Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ samples covering from
BaFe₂As₂(x=0) to KFe₂As₂(x=1) and a series of BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂
single crystals were synthesized by solid-state-reaction method and
self-flux method, respectively.[9, 11]

The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using Rigaku
D/max-A x-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the range of
10^(∘) - 70^(∘) with the step of 0.02^(∘) at room temperature. The main
peaks in XRD patterns of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂
systems can be indexed using the ThCr₂Si₂-type structure with the space
group I₄/mmm, indicating that the samples are almost single phase. The
resistivity was measured using the standard four-probe method. The
thermoelectric power was measured using a laboratory made system with a
differential method.

## III Results and Discussion

The resistivity for the Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂
samples is shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. In these two
series of samples, the anomaly associated with the structural and
magnetic transition is pronounced for the low-doped samples. The anomaly
is suppressed with increasing doping and in the meantime
superconductivity emerges. T_(c) increases with further potassium or
cobalt doping and reaches the maximum around x=0.4 and 0.2,
respectively. Then, T_(c) begins to decrease from the maximum of about
37.5 K for the potassium doping and 25 K for the cobalt doping. At x=1
of potassium doping, T_(c) is 3.8 K for the KFe₂As₂ sample, the same as
reported by Sasmal _et al.[6]_T_(c)_ as a func tion of Co or K doping is
summarized in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.

Temperature dependence of thermoelectric power for the
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ samples is shown in Fig.
4. The parent compound and all the Co-doped samples show negative
thermoelectric power, suggesting that electron-type carriers dominate,
while all the K-doped samples show positive thermoelectric power,
indicating hole-type charge carriers. When the doping level x is less
than 0.1, the absolute value of thermoelectric power starts to decrease
around the temperature at which the resistivity starts to decrease, as
shown by the arrows in Fig. 4.

Such a remarkable change in the thermoelectric power should be caused by
the change in the electronic state when the system undergoes the
structural transition and spin-density-wave (SDW) transition, and such a
behavior has already been explained theoretically [12] and observed in
many other compounds. [13, 14, 15] Such behavior is gradually suppressed
with increasing doping, and disappears when x>0.2 in
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ system, and x> 0.16 in BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂
system, being consistent with the resistivity data.

For the superconducting samples, the absolute value of thermoelectric
power, |S|, increases with decreasing tempera

SDW transition, consisting with the changes in resistivity in Fig. 1(b).

ture, while at low temperatures it develops a broad maximum which
becomes broader with increasing doping. |S|, at around 100 K, increases
quickly with K or Co doping at underdoped region, reaches a maximum of
about 75 μV/K, and then decreases with further doping. Such a large
value of |S| is very unusual in superconducting materials. However, the
large |S| has already been observed in F-doped LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x),[16;
17; 18] Co-doped SmFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)AsO,[8] and Ni-doped
BaFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂.[19] It should be a universal feature for
iron-based arsenide superconductors. The large thermoelectric power in
superconducting region is hard to understand in conventional metal. We
note that the thermoelectric power of Na_(x)CoO₂ is remarkably enhanced
due to the electronic spin entropy.[20] Careful studies on the magnetic
susceptibility have found that the normal-state magnetic susceptibility
indeed shows a domelike doping dependence in F-doped
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) system.[21] This susceptibility enhancement could
be associated with spin fluctuations.[21] In BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂
system, the spin fluctuations are completely suppressed when x> 0.3
(Ref. [22]) while strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found
in KFe₂As₂.[23] Thus it suggests that the large thermoelectric power
might have a magnetic origin.

It is well established that there is a universal doping (hole
concentration) dependence of superconducting transition temperature,
T_(c), for high-T_(c) cuprates. Furthermore, Tallon _et al._ have found
that there exists a close correlation between the room-temperature
thermoelectric power, S(290 K), and the hole concentration, p. A
universal correlation between T_(c) and S(290 K) is generalized in
cuprate superconductors.[24; 25] In Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and
BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ systems, we also plot the S(300 K) and T_(c) as a
function of the doping level x. In Fig. 2, S(300 K) decreases
monotonously with Co doping for BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ system, while
T_(c) as a function of Co doping shows a domelike behavior,[9] being
consistent with previous reports.[26] It is similar to high-T_(c)
cuprates in which the thermoelectric power of normal state decreases
monotonously with increasing doping level while T_(c) as a function of
doping level shows a domelike behavior.[24; 25] In Fig. 3, S(300 K)
increases with K doping for x> 0.1, reaches a maximum at x= 0.6, and
then gradually decreases with increasing x in the overdoped region in
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ system. S(300 K) as a function of K doping shows a
domelike behavior as T_(c) does.

Thermoelectric power is known to be very sensitive to the Fermi-surface
(FS) topology.[27] Since thermoelectric power, roughly speaking, depends
on the derivative of the density of states at the Fermi level, it is
sensitive to subtle changes in curvature of the Fermi surface caused by
the changes in carrier concentrations via K or Co doping. For a
multiband system, the thermoelectric power is jointly determined by the
density of states of all the bands near the Fermi level. Iron pnictides
display a semimetal band structure with three hole bands and two
electron bands close to the Fermi level E_(F) as obtained by
electronic-structure calculations[28; 29; 30] and is confirmed by
angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.[31; 32] The change in area
on holelike and electronlike Fermi surfaces goes in the opposite
direction. When doping Co into electron-type BaFe₂As₂, electron
concentration monotonously increases with increasing Co content, which
was confirmed by the Hall coefficient.[33; 34] So with Co level
increasing, the area on holelike Fermi surfaces becomes smaller[35] and
disappears at the heavy-doped region,[36] but the area on electronlike
FSs always becomes larger, leading to a monotonic increase of |S(300 K)|
with Co doping. Opposite to BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ system, when doping K
into parent compound BaFe₂As₂, the area on electronlike FSs becomes
smaller[37] and disappears at the heavy-doped region,[38] but the area
on holelike FSs always becomes larger. If only consider the evolution of
fermi surfaces, S(300 K) as a function of K doping should be a monotonic
behavior. However, actually, S(300 K) as a function of K-doping level
exhibits more complicated behavior. One possible explanation is that
there exists strong spin fluctuations in heavy-doped
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (Ref. [23]) system but not in heavy-doped
BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ (Ref. [22]) system as mentioned before. To prove
this, more experiments are needed.

We also report large thermoelectric power factors for the compounds
studied in this family as shown in Fig. 5. The power factors reach 1.3
mW m⁻¹ K⁻² in Ba_(0.7)K_(0.3)Fe₂As₂ and 1.5 mW m⁻¹ K⁻² in
BaFe_(1.66)Co_(0.34)As₂, which is the same magnitude as that in
Na_(x)Co₂O₄ (Refs. [39] and [40]) and Bi-Sb alloys.[41] Up to now, the
best thermoelectric performance in the 80-100 K temperature range is
found in single-crystalline Bi-Sb alloys with a thermoelectric figure of
merit ZT reaching about 0.5. The magnitude of the thermoelectric power
of iron oxypnictides is close to the best value obtained in Bi-Sb
alloys.[41] Meanwhile, much higher thermoelectric power values have
already been reported in iron-based superconductors which have good
electric conductivity. For examples, the thermoelectric power reaches
−130 μV/K in F-doped LaFeAsO, −100 μV/K in F doped NdFeAsO,[16; 17; 18]
and −80 μV/K in Co-doped SmFeAsO,[8] leading to much higher power
factors. And also, we note that the values of resistivity are obtained
in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ polycrystalline samples that are not very
dense, thus an improvement in this aspect can easily be made.

On the other hand, it has been reported that hole doping on the
rare-earth oxide layer or Fe-As layer can yield p-type materials. This
would be of fundamental interest for applica

tions since the thermoelectric properties of the known _p_-type
compounds are rather poor at low temperature. Furthermore, we can
simultaneously find _n_-type and _p_-type materials with large
thermoelectric power in the same kind of iron oxypnictides, showing that
iron oxypnictides will be good candidates for thermoelectric cooling
applications in the liquid-nitrogen temperature range.

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, the transport properties for Co-doped
BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ system and K-doped Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ exhibit
systematic evolution with Co- and K-doping level, respectively.
Combining resistivity and thermoelectric power, we can see that SDW
order is quickly suppressed and superconductivity emerges by Co or K
doping. Phase diagrams are derived based on the transport measurements
and a domelike behavior for T_(c) as a function of x (K- or Co-doping
content) is established. Furthermore, |S(300 K)| as a function of x in
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ also shows a domelike behavior as T_(c)(x) does
while it evolves monotonously in BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ system. The
difference between the two systems may be caused due to the different
evolution of the Fermi surfaces and the intensity of spin fluctuations.
Besides, the large thermoelectric power factors in iron-oxypnictide
materials indicate potential applications in thermoelectric cooling
modules around liquid-nitrogen temperatures.
