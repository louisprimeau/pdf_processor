###### Abstract

Neutron diffraction has been used to study the effects of oxygen on the magnetic order of the rare-earth ions in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (R = Dy, Er, Nd). For fully oxygenated superconducting (T_{c} = 92 K) ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, two-dimensional (2D) short-range magnetic correlations are observed just above the ordering temperature T_{N} = 0.62 K, while at T_{N} long-range correlations develop in the _a_-_b_ plane, inducing 3D long-range order. Below T_{N} the sublattice magnetization is found to obey Onsager's exact solution of the 2D S = \frac{1}{2} Ising model. For oxygen-reduced (x = 0.6) superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}, the 3D ordering temperature is lowered to T_{N} \approx 0.48 K. For insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x \approx 0) _neither_ 2D nor 3D long-range order develops, as _only_ 2D short-range correlations are observed. For DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (T_{c} \simeq 92 K) 3D long-range order occurs at T_{N} \approx 0.93 K, with spins coupled antiferromagnetically along all three crystallographic axes. As we reduce the oxygen concentration the 3D magnetic ordering temperature decreases. In addition, for a concentration 0.54 \leq x_{c} < 1, still in the superconducting phase, the spin configuration changes along the _c_-axis to ferromagnetic. In the insulating phase, x \lesssim 0.4, we observe _both_ 2D and 3D diffuse scattering developing below 2 K, but 3D long-range order never occurs. In our highest oxygenated NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94} (T_{c} \simeq 92 K), 3D long-range order develops below T_{N} \simeq 0.53 K. For a small reduction of oxygen to x = 0.78, we observe drastic effects on the Nd order as _only_ short-range 2D correlations are found at low temperatures. At nonsuperconducting x = 0.45, 3D correlations develop at low temperatures, yet long-range order still does not occur. For x = 0.3, 3D long-range order is reesta-blished, developing below T_{N} \approx 1.5 K, three times that of the fully oxygenated material. Though the oxygen dependence of the rare-earth magnetism varies between the three compounds we have studied, our results indicate there is significant coupling between the chain layer oxygen and the rare-earth ions in each case.

## I Introduction

The rare-earth magnetic interactions in the R 123 systems have generally been considered to be rather simple. This notion was motivated partly by early experiments which showed that substitution of other rare earths for yttrium in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} did not affect superconductivity, suggesting that the rare-earth sublattice is electronically isolated from the superconducting Cu-O planes.[1] In addition, the ordering temperatures for the magnetic rare earths are near 1 K, which for the heavy rare earths is in the range where magnetic dipole-dipole interactions are important, and this also suggests that the rare-earth ions are isolated. This picture is consistent with measurements which found no difference in the magnetic order of Gd in fully deoxygenated GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} as compared to fully oxygenated GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[11] However, more recent specific-heat and neutron-scattering measurements on the oxygen dependence of the magnetic order of Er,[2, 3] Dy,[3, 4] and Nd (Refs. [3] and [5]) have indicated that chain layer oxygen vacancies affects the rare-earth magnetic order.

We will show in this work that indeed oxygen has a strong influence on the magnetic order of rare-earth ions. In going from fully oxygenated superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} to nominally oxygenated insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x \approx 0) we go from a rare-earth system that exhibits three-dimensional (3D) long-range order at low temperature to a system with only 2D short-range magnetic correlations at the lowest achievable temperatures (T = 60 mK). We have made measurements on single crystals with three different oxygen concentrations: fully oxygenated x \approx 1, partially deoxygenated x \approx 0.6, and nominally oxygenated x \approx 0.

In addition, we have made measurements on several single crystals as well as powder samples of DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} over the full range of oxygen concentra  tions 0\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,1. For fully oxygenated, superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} we observe the 2D and 3D magnetic nature of the Dy order, analogous to the magnetic behavior of Er observed in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[6] Long-range order develops at T_{N}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.93 K with Dy spins coupled antiferromagnetically along all three crystallographic axes, while above T_{N} we observe a rod of scattering, characteristic of 2D behavior. As the oxygen concentration is reduced the ordering temperature decreases, and at an oxygen concentration still in the superconducting phase the spin configuration changes along the c axis to ferromagnetic. For x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,0, where the Cu spins also exhibit long-range antiferromagnetic order, the magnetic behavior is drastically altered. Quite unexpectedly, _both_ 2D and 3D magnetic correlations develop below \approx 2 K, but 3D long-range order never develops even though the 2D correlations become long range within our experimental resolution.

Finally, we report our results from neutron-scattering and specific-heat measurements on the oxygen dependence of the magnetic order of Nd in powder samples of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.94, 0.78, 0.45, 0.3, 0.13). For our highest oxygen concentration, superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, we found that the Nd ions develop 3D long-range magnetic order at T_{N}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.53 K, with spins coupled antiferromagnetically along the a, b, and c directions and the moment aligned along c.[7] The two experimental techniques at our disposal allow us to observe the manifestations of this long-range magnetic order in two forms: a sharp specific-heat anomaly, and resolution-limited magnetic Bragg peaks via neutron scattering. As we remove oxygen from this sample to arrive at partially deoxygenated superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.45} does not restore long-range order, though the magnetic scattering now indicates correlations along the c axis. With further reduction to NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.3}, we find that long-range order has been restored, as evidenced by a sharp specific-heat anomaly and resolution-limited magnetic Bragg peaks. The 3D configuration of spins is identical to what we observe in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, but we find that the ordering temperature is more than three times higher than for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, increasing to T_{N}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,1.5 K, and the moment direction is now canted off the c axis by \approx\,45^{\circ}. We note that preliminary results of our measurements on NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} have been reported earlier.[8]

## II Experimental conditions

The neutron experiments were performed at the research reactor at the National Institute of Standards and Technology on the triple-axis spectrometers BT-9 and BT-2. The scattering data were taken with a wavelength of 2.35 A, which corresponds to an incoming neutron energy of E_{i} = 14.8 meV, and a pyrolytic graphite monochromator and filter. Both a He^{3} and He dilution refrigerator were used for the low-temperature measurements. The ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} with x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0, and x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.6 single crystals were prepared using a modified self-flux technique.[9] The as-grown single crystals were annealed in N_{2} at 600 degC for about a week to reduce the oxygen content to ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0). SQUID magnetometer measurements on the annealed crystal revealed no diamagnetic signal down to 4.2 K. The same crystal was later annealed in O_{2} at 900 degC for about 2 h, and cooled to 500 degC at the rate of 50 degC/h, then very slowly cooled to room temperature at an average rate of 0.6 degC/h to achieve x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.6. SQUID magnetometer measurements on this crystal revealed a superconducting transition T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,75 K. The preparation of the fully oxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,1,T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,92 K) single crystal has been described in a previous article.[6]

The growth technique for the DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} single crystals has been described in a previous article.[10] The measured superconducting transition temperature for the fully oxygenated x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,1 crystal was T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,90 K, while that for our x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.54 powder sample was T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,50 K. We have made measurements on several different Dy123 single-crystal samples, ranging in weight from 2 to 250 mg, as well as a 13-g powder sample. A neutron profile refinement at a wavelength of 1.5453 A and collimation of 10^{\prime}-20^{\prime}-10^{\prime} was done on the BT-1 powder diffractometer to establish the oxygen stoichiometry of the Dy powder sample.

The preparation of the NdBa_{2}C_{3}O_{6+x} powder sample has been described in detail in a previous article.[5] A polycrystal sample was chosen so that the oxygen content could be readily determined and varied. A neutron profile refinement was done to establish the oxygen stoichiometry of the powder. The lowest achievable oxygen concentration for this sample was x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.22, which results in partial occupation of the interchain O(5) site by oxygen.[11] The superconducting transition for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94} was T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,92 K, while that of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78} was T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,63 K.

## III Experimental results on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}

### Fully oxygenated superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}

We have discussed in previous articles[6] our study of the 2D and 3D magnetic behavior of fully oxygenated superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} using neutron-scattering techniques, so we will only briefly summarize our results here. Our measurements were made in the (h\,\,0\,\,l) scattering plane, where a rod of diffuse scattering is observed just below T\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,1 K, which is due to the 2D short-range magnetic correlations of Er spins. Below T_{N}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.62 K the sublattice magnetization, which is a measure of the thermodynamic order parameter, is found to obey Onsager's exact solution of the 2D S\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,\frac{1}{2} Ising model.[12, 13] The indexing of the 3D magnetic Bragg peak for the ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} crystal used in this study is of the (\frac{1}{2}O\frac{1}{2}) type, which corresponds to a ground-state spin configuration characterized by spins coupled antiferromagnetically along both the a and c directions, and ferromagnetically coupled spins along the b direction, with  the moments lying along b (see Fig. 1). This is the only spin configuration we have observed with this sample.

### Partially de-oxygenated superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}

Now we turn to our partially deoxygenated single crystal which we shall refer to as ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}. The sample is in the superconducting orthorhombic phase with an approximate oxygen concentration of x\approx 0.6. In Fig. 2, we show a low-temperature scan through the resolution-limited 3D magnetic Bragg peak, indexed as (\frac{1}{2},0,0), measured on the ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} crystal. This indexing is appropriate for spins aligned antiferromagnetically along the a axis, and ferromagnetically along the b and c directions. We have also determined the moment to be along the crystallographic b direction, as expected. Again this is the only ground-state configuration we observe in this sample, and this is a different single crystal than the one in which we observed the (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}) structure. We do not believe the different magnetic structures are due to the differing oxygen concentrations, since in fully oxygenated powder samples of our own, in the powder and single crystals of Chattopadhyay _et al._,[14] and the single crystals of Paul _et al._,[15] peaks with integer l are seen. The two possible Er spins structures are shown in Fig. 1.

In Fig. 3(a), we show a scan across the rod through the rod point (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ 0.3) at a temperature just above the 3D ordering temperature T_{N}\approx 0.48 K. This diffuse scattering is due to 2D short-range magnetic correlations in the a-b plane. The solid curve is a least-squares fit to a Lorentzian convoluted with the Gaussian resolution function. The Lorentzian shape of the intrinsic function is based on the Ornstein-Zernike approximation for the spin-spin correlation function. The diffuse magnetic scattering is then given by the spin-spin correlation function

\[\left[\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right]_{\rm diffuse} \propto \langle S(-\,{\bf q})S({\bf q})\rangle-\langle S(-\,{\bf q}) \rangle\langle S({\bf q})\rangle\] (1) \[\propto (q^{2}+\kappa^{2})^{-1}\ .\]

The half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the Lorentzian \kappa\ (=1/\xi) is the 2D inverse correlation length, {\bf q}=q_{x}\hat{a}^{\ast}+q_{y}\hat{b}^{\ast}=Q_{x}\hat{a}^{\ast}+Q_{y}\hat {b}^{\ast}-\tau_{\rm 2D} and \tau_{\rm 2D} is the 2D reciprocal-lattice vector, which for Er is given by (\frac{1}{2}\ 0). By fitting these data with the Ornstein-Zernike form we are able to extract the 2D correlations in the system at a given temperature, and in this way we can observe the evolution of the correlations in the a-b plane. At T_{N} the 2D correlations are long range and the peak becomes resolution limited. This has been discussed in detail for ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7},[16] as well as for prototypical 2D systems such as K_{2}NiF_{4}.[17] Also shown in this figure is a scan along the rod just above the ordering temperature. We see that the scattering intensity is independent of the momentum transfer Q_{z} along the c direction, indicating that there are essentially no correlations along the c axis in the system above T_{N}. Therefore we say that above

Figure 1: Observed spin structures of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. (a) Magnetic unit cell and 3D spin structure corresponding to (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}) indexing of magnetic Bragg peaks and (b) spin structure corresponding to (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ 0) indexing. We observe the (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ 0) structure in our ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} crystal.

  the system exhibits _only_ 2D short-range magnetic correlations in the _a-b_ plane. We remark that this is qualitatively the same behavior we observe in fully oxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

At the ordering temperature, when strong correlations develop in the _a-b_ plane, even a very weak interaction along the c direction is enough to induce 3D long-range order (see discussions in Refs. [6] and [16]. Therefore, below T_{N}, we measure the magnetic Bragg scattering at the 3D positions. The temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering for our partially deoxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} crystal is shown in Fig. 4, measured at the 3D magnetic Bragg position (\frac{1}{2} 0 0). We have also included in this figure the results for our fully oxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} crystal for comparison. From the figure we can see that the transition temperature in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} has decreased markedly from that of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The transition is also notably broader, but we found a distribution of oxygen concentrations in this sample which we believe is creating this effect. In the fully oxygenated multicrystals of Paul _et al._[15] they saw both the (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) structures, but with no discernible difference in the ordering temperatures of the two structures. Thus we believe the shift we observe in T_{N} is an oxygen effect. Indeed, the shift downward in transition temperature with decreasing oxygen concentration agrees qualitatively with the results of Maletta _et al._[19] on Er123 powder samples, where they also found that the ordered moment had decreased. Unfortunately, for these measurements only the He^{3} system was available, and thus we did not get to a low enough temperature to measure the fully ordered moment.

### Insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\approx 0)

The results of our measurements on a nominally oxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\approx 0) crystal are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5(a) is a scan across the rod at our lowest achievable temperature (60 mK), and we see that the intensity peaks at the rod position. Again the solid curve is a least-squares fit to a Lorentzian intrinsic scattering function convoluted with the Gaussian resolution function, from which we find that even at this very low temperature this peak is not resolution limited. Indeed we extract a 2D correlation length of just 15 A at this temperature, so that the system is exhibiting only short-range order. In Fig. 5(b), we show a scan along the rod also at

Figure 4: Magnetic scattering intensity vs temperature measured at the (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) 3D magnetic Bragg point on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}, T_{N}\approx 0.48 K, as compared to measurements made on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} at the (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) 3D magnetic Bragg point, T_{N}= 0.62 K.

Figure 3: (a) Scan across the rod of scattering in reciprocal space at the rod point (\frac{1}{2} 0 0.3), showing the 2D character just above T_{N}= 0.48 K in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}. (b) A scan along the rod shows the scattering intensity does not vary significantly along Q_{z}, indicating there are no significant spin correlations between planes, even just above T_{N}. The slight decrease in intensity with increasing Q_{z} is due to the magnetic form factor.

  our lowest temperature, and we see that the diffuse intensity extended along Q_{z} is flat. In this scan we go through the 3D Bragg positions as well as points away from where the 3D Bragg points would lie, and yet there is no discernible change in the intensity. These results lead us to conclude that for ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) the Er spins exhibit _only_ 2D short-range magnetic order down to T\!=\!60 mK.

Finally, in Fig. 6 we have the temperature dependence of the diffuse magnetic scattering. The diffuse scattering develops below about 0.7 K, increasing continuously as we lower the temperature but never saturating down to our lowest achievable temperature of 60 mK.

The 2D spin configuration which corresponds to the indexing of the 2D scattering vector is shown as an inset to Fig. 6. This is the same 2D spin configuration as seen in the oxygenated samples above their respective ordering temperatures, with the important difference that now a\!=\!b. From our measurements we are not able to determine the preferred moment direction, but presumably it is still in the a-b plane (see Simizu _et al._ in Ref. [2]).

## IV Theoretical analysis: Er magnetic dipole interactions

The low ordering temperature for the Er system suggests a rather weakly interacting system of spins. An appropriate model for the Er interaction may therefore be a simple dipole-dipole interaction. The total (ground-state) energy for a system of fully ordered point dipoles can be obtained by summing over the individual dipole-dipole interactions:

\[E\!=\!-\sum_{i}^{\rm all spins}\sum_{j>i}\frac{3(\mu_{i}\!\cdot\!\hat{\tau}_{ ij})(\mu_{j}\!\cdot\!\hat{\tau}_{ij})\!-\!(\mu_{i}\!\cdot\!\mu_{j})}{r_{ij}^{3}}\ .\] (2)

Even though Eq. (2) assumes that the system is fully ordered (i.e., sufficiently low temperatures), a good order-of-magnitude estimate of the expected transition temperature can be made from it by finding the average energy per spin for N spins, E/N. We have made this calculation for ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and its two possible spin configurations. We use the measured \mu\!=\!4.9\mu_{B} and \mu\!\parallel\!\hat{\bf b}, a\!=\!3.82 A, b\!=\!3.88 A, and c\!=\!11.66 A, and find that the energy per spin converges very quickly (within 18% when summing over nearest neighbors only, and within 5% out

Figure 5: (a) Scan across the rod at the rod point (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) in nominally oxygenated insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) at T\!=\!60 mK. (b) A scan along the rod shows that the scattering intensity does not vary significantly along Q_{z}. The 2D correlations in the a-b plane are only short range, as we have determined \xi\!\simeq\!15 Ã… at T\!=\!60 mK.

Down to T\!=\!60 mK the scattering intensity does not saturate. Inset: the spin configuration in the a-b plane for tetragonal ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0). This is also the lowest-energy spin configuration, with the moment lying in the plane, based on dipole energy considerations.

  to next-nearest neighbors) to e \simeq\!-0.66 K ( \simeq\!T_{N} in K) for both the (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) spin configurations. This is in good agreement with the experimentally determined ordering temperature of T_{N}\!=\!0.62 K. Monte Carlo simulations of the Er order have been made assuming a 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising antiferromagnet with dipole interactions [20], where it is found that the ordering temperature is fairly close to the experimentally measured value, again indicating the importance of the dipole interaction.

Misra and Felsteiner have made detailed dipole calculations of the low-temperature (ordered) spin structure of Er in Er123 assuming dipole-dipole interactions, and they find that the two 3D structures observed (Fig. 1) are degenerate [21]. Since we observe only one structure or the other in a particular sample, this may indicate that the 3D spin structure in Er123 may be sensitive to defects in the samples such as the density of grain and twin boundaries, which somehow lift the degeneracy. The fact that both the (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) and (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) structures have been so readily observed in many different Er123 samples by various workers (our work as well as that of Refs. [14] and [15]), indicates that the (dipole) degeneracy is the likely explanation.

As might be expected since c\!\simeq\!3a, the contribution to Eq. (2) from spins in other layers is very small, indeed they are so small that the 3D structures characterized by (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) and (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) wave vectors are apparently degenerate. Thus we will treat only the two-dimensional Er spin system, as the 2D interactions are dominating the ordering. If we consider what happens when the system goes into its tetragonal phase, we put a\!=\!b and then assume the moment direction is somewhere in the a-b plane. For an exchange-only magnetic system this would be well described by a 2D XY model. However, for a dipole system the a-b symmetry increases from twofold in the orthorhombic phase to fourfold in the tetragonal phase rather than to a continuous symmetry. With the moment in the 2D plane we find from Eq. (2) that the lowest-energy dipole spin configuration is that in Fig. 6, which is also the experimentally observed configuration. The dominant contribution to the average energy per spin, as determined by Eq. (2), comes from its four nearest neighbors in the a-b plane, and for the spins lying in the plane with the spin configuration as in Fig. 6 we have

\[\varepsilon_{nn}\!=\!-\frac{6\mu^{2}}{a^{3}}(1\!-\!2\cos^{2}\!\theta)\ ,\] (3)

where \theta is the angle in the a-b plane between the moment direction and the axis along which the spins are coupled antiferromagnetically. From Eq. (3) we find that \varepsilon_{nn} has its minimum at \theta\!=\!90^{\circ}, when the moment lies along the axis with the spins coupled ferromagnetically as depicted in Fig. 7. Therefore, the angular dependence to \varepsilon_{nn} leads to an anisotropy in the plane, such that the moment prefers to be along the a, or equivalently along the b axis, and the moments coupled ferromagnetically along that direction.

The specific-heat data of Simizu _et al._[2] in orthorhombic ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\gtrsim\!0.3) fit very nicely to a 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising model, while in the tetragonal phase (x\!\lesssim\!0.3) the specific-heat peak was significantly broadened and fit more effectively to an XY model. The authors suggested this may be due to the removal of the anisotropy in the a-b plane, so that the Er spin, which is locked along the b axis in the orthorhombic phase, becomes an XY spin in the tetragonal phase. Though the observation of a broad specific anomaly in tetragonal Er123 (Ref. [2]) is consistent with the short-range order we observe in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!=\!0), from our analysis we see that the dipole interactions lead to a fourfold spin degeneracy rather than the continuous degeneracy of an XY model. Thus for the Er spins in tetragonal Er123, an XY model with continuous degeneracy is inappropriate. In theory the ground state of the dipole model is stable, and should exhibit long-range order at a temperature of the same order of magnitude as that for the 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising model [22]. With this in mind it is surprising that short-range order persists in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) down to temperatures which are more than an order-of-magnitude smaller than the T_{N} (=\!0.62 K) in the 2D Ising like ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

## V Discussion of the Er results

Specific-heat results [2] indicate that the crystal-field ground state remains a doublet for 0 \lesssim\!x\!\lesssim\!1 in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. Our own inelastic neutron-scattering experiments reveal that the lowest-energy crystal-field excitations are at 9.32 and 10.99 meV for the fully oxygenated sample, and they shift down to 7.06 and 10.97 meV for the fully deoxygenated system. The energy of the first excited state is large enough over the entire oxygen range that only the ground doublet should contribute appreciably to the free energy in the vicinity of T_{N}. Thus the Er^{3+} ions in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} compounds can be treated as effectively S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} particles over the entire oxygen range. However, we believe that further crystal-field measurements for more values of x in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}, 0\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!1, would be enlightening. Since the crystal-field ground state of the Er^{3+} ions is unaffected by oxygen concentration, the effects we observe must be due to changes in the magnetic interactions between Er ions.

Though the rare earths are likely electronically decoupled from the Cu-O planes on the order of T_{c} perhaps they are not decoupled on the order of T_{N} (<\!<\!T_{c}). With this in mind, a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida

Figure 7: The lowest-energy spin structure, with the moment in the plane, for dipole interactions. The fact that there is an easy axis for the moment direction rules out the possibility of the Er spins being described by an isotropic XY model in the tetragonal phase.

  (**RKKY**) indirect exchange interaction between Er ions is possible, and presumably would be affected by oxygen concentration. **A RKKY** interaction has also been proposed theoretically[23,24] to explain neutron-scattering measurements, on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, for instance. However, there is still only limited experimental evidence that **a** RKKY interaction plays a role (Ref. [23], and references therein).

If there is an indirect coupling between the Er ions and the chain layer then the removal of oxygen could disrupt the Er spin interactions, reducing the average Er magnetic moment per site, and thus lowering the ordering temperature (recall from above k_{B}T_{N}\!\approx\!\epsilon\!\propto\!\mu^{2}). This will persist through the tetragonal phase where the Cu begins to order. The Cu order has not been considered to influence the rare earths in the 123 system, since the rare earths are believed to be at a symmetry site where all Cu magnetic interactions cancel. However, recent Mossbauer measurements on Er^{3+} diluted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} indicate an anomalous molecular field of B_{{\rm Cu}(2)}\!=\!200 G at the Er site due to the magnetic order of the Cu(2) in the Cu-O planes, and similar experiments on Yb^{3+} diluted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} indicate an even larger field of B_{{\rm Cu}(2)}\!=\!1600 G at the Yb site.[25] The size of the field at the Er site is about an order-of-magnitude smaller than the (saturated) Er dipole field, though the field found at the Yb site is about the same order of magnitude (comparing \epsilon_{m}\!=\!-6\mu^{2}/a^{3} with \mu\!\cdot\!B_{{\rm Cu}(2)}). With this range of field strengths observed at the rare-earth site it is possible that a Cu molecular field and the Er dipole field are competing interactions. This anomalous Cu molecular field, along with an indirect coupling of Er to the chain layer oxygen, may explain the diminishing magnetic order of Er as oxygen concentration decreases in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}.

### The 2D rod of magnetic scattering in Dy123

In our scattering experiments on single-crystal samples of Dy123 the measurements were made in the (_h h 1_) scattering plane. In Fig. 8, we present a diagram of reciprocal space, showing the positions of the 3D nuclear (crystal structure) and magnetic (spin structure) Bragg points, as well as the Bragg rods associated with 2D character. We have noted in this figure the positions of the magnetic Bragg points associated with the two oxygen-dependent spin structures. The rods of scattering extend along the (Q_{z}) direction in reciprocal space where the magnetic interactions are weakest, and thus the correlations along the c axis are inhibited. The anisotropy of the rare-earth magnetic unit cell, where nearest neighbors along the c direction are three times as distant as in the _a-b_ plane, is the direct cause of the weak 3D interaction. Above the ordering temperature the rod intensity is due to short-range magnetic correlations in the _a-b_ plane, while below T_{N} it arises from low-energy magnetic excitations.

In Fig. 9(a), we show a scan across the rod of magnetic scattering, just above the 3D ordering temperature (T_{N}\!\approx\!0.9 K). These data are for a superconducting sample, and are typical of what we observe in our superconducting single crystals of DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. This strong rod of scattering develops for temperatures \la2 K, as will be discussed below. Since the HWHM of this peak is a direct measure of the inverse 2D correlation length \kappa, then by scanning across the rod at various temperatures we observe the evolution of the magnetic correlations in the _a-b_ plane. Also shown in this figure is a scan along the rod, which demonstrates that the scattering intensity is independent of Q_{z}. Hence above T_{N} there are no significant correlations between spins in adjacent _a-b_ planes, directly demonstrating that the c-axis interactions are very weak. The decrease in the scattering intensity Q_{z} we see in Fig. 9(b) is presumably due to the preferred c-axis alignment of the Dy spins, and the consequent suppression of the transverse magnetic fluctuations expected for an Ising-like system. There is also an additional fall off of intensity because of magnetic form factor effects.

### Fully oxygenated DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} single crystals

Figure 10 shows the intensity versus temperature at a point on the rod (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} 0.2) measured on our fully oxygenated superconducting sample DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The rod starts to develop below about 2 K, and the intensity steadily increases with decreasing temperature until it

(b) The scattering plane showing the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0)-type configuration of spins.

  peaks at T_{N}\!\simeq\!0.93 K, when long-range order sets in. Below T_{N} the intensity quickly decreases, presumably due to the sharp increase in the energy of the magnetic excitations, and the consequent decrease in their thermal population. This is what one would expect for an Ising-like system in which the transverse fluctuations are suppressed. Therefore, we may assume that the diffuse magnetic scattering intensity is primarily due to the longitudinal fluctuations of the Dy spins.

The temperature dependence of the inverse 2D correlations \kappa(T) is shown in Fig. 11. Each data point is extracted from a scan across the rod similar to that shown in Fig. 9(a). The data values for \kappa have been obtained by a deconvolution of the measured width of the rod, where we assume a Gaussian resolution function folded with a Lorentzian intrinsic function. As discussed earlier, the intrinsic function is based on the Ornstein-Zernike approximation for the spin-spin correlation function, as given in Eq. (1). The correlation length \xi_{\rm 2D} (=\!1/\kappa) grows continuously as the temperature is decreased, until at T_{N} the correlations are long range and the width of the rod is resolution limited. The solid curve is a fit to the power law (T\!-\!T_{N})^{0.9}. The exponent \nu\!=\!0.9 is within 10% of the critical exponent for the 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising model where in the limit T\!\to\!T_{N}, \kappa\!\sim\![(T\!-\!T_{N})^{/}T_{N}]^{\nu}, with \nu\!=\!1. When strong correlations develop in the a-b plane, 3D long-range order is also induced, so that below T_{N} the elastic component of the magnetic scattering arises at 3D Bragg points characterized by the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) wave vector, rather than a purely elastic component uniformly distributed along the rod.

Figure 10: Intensity of the rod of scattering as a function of temperature for a single crystal of fully oxygenated DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The intensity is seen to peak at the ordering temperature T_{N}\!\simeq\!0.93 K, where long-range correlations develop in the a-b plane.

Figure 9: (a) A scan across the rod of magnetic scattering in reciprocal space, showing the 2D character just above T_{N}\!\simeq\!0.91 K in a single crystal of superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} and (b) a scan along the rod, showing that the scattering intensity does not vary significantly along Q_{z}.

  peak is shown in Fig. 12. The curve is quite sharp, a characteristic of the 2D magnetic nature of the system. However, we do not find quantitative agreement with the order parameter for a 2D S = \frac{1}{2} Ising model, in contrast to the behavior found in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[3, 6, 16] In fact, we have taken measurements on a number of other Dy123 samples, and we found even broader curves but in no case did we find a sharper curve. This is somewhat surprising since magnetic specific-heat measurements on DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} display a logarithmic divergence at the ordering temperature in agreement with the 2D S = \frac{1}{2} Ising model. However, a small distribution of T_{N}'s in the neutron samples may be spoiling the quantitative agreement with the 2D Ising model. The spin structure for this oxygen concentration is also depicted here, where the spins are coupled antiferromagnetically along all three crystallographic directions and the moment is along the c axis. This is the same spin structure determined in the neutron-scattering experiments of Goldman _et al_.[26] and Fischer _et al_.[27] on powder samples of fully oxygenated superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

### Oxygen dependence of the spin configuration

Our data reveal that the magnetic structure along the c axis changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, depending on oxygen content. One might guess that the most likely concentration for the spin structure to change would be x \approx 0.4, where the system changes from metallic to semiconducting and where long-range magnetic order of the Cu moments occurs for x \lesssim 0.4. However, this turns out not to be the case, as we found that the structure had already changed at substantially higher x, in the superconducting regime.

To determine the oxygen concentration where the magnetic structure changes, we needed single crystals at intermediate x, with a uniform distribution of oxygen throughout the sample. Such uniformity turned out to be very difficult to obtain while controlling the value of x. We therefore decided to take data on a polycrystalline sample, where good oxygen uniformity could be readily obtained. The powder sample of DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} was made by the usual solid-state reaction techniques. The oxygen stoichiometry of the powder was established using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In addition, neutron powder diffraction data were obtained for one of the oxygen concentrations, and a full profile refinement was carried out to determine the absolute value of x. We obtained x = 0.54 \pm 0.03 for the sample with a measured T_{c} of 50 K. This refinement unambiguously established the oxygen content, and was in fact in excellent agreement with the TGA results starting from a "fully" oxygenated sample of x = 0.99 \pm 0.04 (TGA).

In Fig. 13(a), we show an angular scan at low temperature taken on this superconducting (T_{c} \simeq 50 K) DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.54} powder sample. In this angular range we observe the three magnetic Bragg peaks (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0), (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}1),

Figure 12: (a) Sublattice magnetization vs temperature obtained from the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) 3D magnetic Bragg peak, with T_{N} \simeq 0.93 K, measured on a single crystal of fully oxygenated DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The 3D configuration of spins appropriate for this oxygen concentration is also shown.

Figure 13: (Top) Low-temperature angular scan through the 3D magnetic Bragg peaks (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0), (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}1), and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}2), made on a powder sample of superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.54} (T_{c} \simeq 50 K). The integral values for l signify that nearest-neighbor spins along the c axis are parallel. (Bottom) An identical low-temperature scan taken after annealing the sample in O_{2} to get fully oxygenated DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The Bragg peaks now arise at the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}l/2) positions (l odd), corresponding to antiferromagnetic spins along c. The appropriate spin structure is displayed to the right of its corresponding graph.

  and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}2), corresponding to spins coupled antiferromagnetically along the a and b directions, and ferromagnetically along the c axis. The spin structure is shown to the right, where we have determined the moment direction to be along the c axis just as for the fully oxygenated case. For comparison we show in Fig. 13(b) the same low-temperature angular scan taken on this powder after being annealed in O_{2}, increasing the oxygen concentration to x\simeq1 (DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}) and the superconducting transition to T_{c}\simeq90\mathbf{K}. Now we see the three magnetic Bragg peaks (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}), (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}), and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) corresponding to antiferromagnetically coupled spins along the c axis. Therefore, we see that removing oxygen changes the spin coupling along the c axis from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic while the system is still in the superconducting phase. These data establish that the magnetic structure changes in the range 0.54<x<1, though we have not determined the precise concentration where this change occurs.

As discussed above, in Fig. 9 we showed measurements of the rod made on a single crystal of superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. An analogous measurement on our DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.54} powder sample is shown in Fig. 14, where we show the magnetic scattering profile above the ordering temperature. The solid curve is a least-squares fit to a 2D model, which assumes there is a rod of magnetic scattering characterized by the 2D wave vector (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}). The model will be discussed in detail in a latter section, when we present our powder data on the Nd system. We are above the 3D T_{N} where the spins are only correlated in the plane, and thus the (2D) spin configuration is the same as at the higher oxygen concentrations.

### Effects of oxygen on the ordering temperature

We also find that creating oxygen vacancies in the chain layer lowers the ordering temperature. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 15, where we contrast the order parameter determined from the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) Bragg peak (T_{N}\simeq0.91\mathbf{K}, x\approx1) with that of the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0) peak (T_{N}\simeq0.87\mathbf{K}, x\approx0.54\  temperatures. However, in Fig. 9(b) the scattering intensity along the rod is flat, indicating that there are essentially no correlations along the c-axis above T_{N} for superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0), while in Fig. 16(b) we see broad peaks at the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}l) positions, with l an integer, indicating that there are considerably stronger, though still short-range, correlations along the c direction above T_{N} in the DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) compound. Even at our lowest temperature of T\!=\!70 mK the widths of these 3D peaks, via a scan along the rod, as in Fig. 16(b), are about an order-of-magnitude larger than the resolution limit, while the widths derived from scans across the rod, as in Fig. 16(a), become resolution limited just below T\!=\!0.6 K. This is in sharp contrast to what occurs in the superconducting compounds, where a scan along the rod reveals resolution-limited magnetic Bragg peaks at low temperatures [T\!<\!T_{N}(3\mathrm{D})]. Again, there is the expected decrease in the scattering intensity for increasing Q_{z} in Fig. 16(b), which is presumably due to the preferred c-axis alignment of the Dy spins, and the consequent suppression of the transverse magnetic fluctuations expected for an Ising-like system. There is also the additional fall off of intensity due to magnetic form-factor effects.

We have measured the temperature dependence of the HWHM of the peak shown in Fig. 16(a), and the results are shown in Fig. 17(a). The data are the deconvolution of the measured width of the rod, where we assume a Gaussian resolution function folded with a Lorentzian intrinsic function as previously done. We know from Eq. (1) that this is the temperature dependence of the inverse 2D correlation length \kappa. Significant 2D correlations develop below about 2 K, and grow continuously until at T\!\approx\!0.55 K long-range correlations develop in the a-b plane, as is evidenced by resolution-limited peaks. The solid curve is a fit to the power law \kappa\!\sim\!(T\!-\!T_{N})^{1}, which is in good agreement with that expected for a 2D system as mentioned earlier.

In Fig. 17(b), we show the temperature dependence of the inverse correlations along the c direction, where the data were extracted from scans along the rod such as in

Figure 16: (a) Scan across the rod, near the 2D ordering temperature T_{N}(2\mathrm{D})\!\approx\!0.55 K, taken on a nominally oxygenated single crystal of nonsuperconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0). (b) Scan along the rod at a temperature near T_{N}(2\mathrm{D}). The 3D peaks develop on the rod below about 2 K, indicating that there are 3D correlations in the system before 2D long-range order in the a-b plane ever occurs.

Figure 17: (a) Temperature dependence of the 2D inverse correlations as measured on the nonsuperconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) single crystal. The data are extracted from scans across the rod as in Fig. 16(a). The solid curve is a fit to the power law (T\!-\!T_{N})^{1} with T_{N}\!=\!0.55 K. (b) Temperature dependence of the c-axis inverse correlations. The data are extracted from scans along the rod (i.e., along Q_{z}). The low-temperature c-axis correlation length is \xi_{c}\!\approx\!13 Ã… (\approx\!c\!=\!11.85 Ã…).

  Fig. 16(b). The correlations along the c direction appear just below 2 K, and grow continuously, until at T\!=\!0.55\mathbf{K} they saturate at \xi_{c\text{-axis}}\!\approx\!13 A when 2D long-range correlations develop in the a-b plane. The fact that 3D long-range order never develops in this compound, even though the correlations in the plane are long range, is quite unexpected. The behavior is at variance to that of all known "2D magnets," in which 3D long-range order is induced as a necessary consequence of the onset of 2D long-range order. The only known exception to this is the Dy order in superconducting Dy_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{8}O_{16}.[18] However, in this compound there is a geometric cancellation of interactions between c-axis layers, which together with the weak intrinsic c-axis coupling renders the _net_ interaction along the c axis much smaller than all other "2D magnets." This is clearly not the case for DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0). The fact that we observe correlations along the c axis above T_{N} indicates that the coupling between layers is somehow enhanced.

Finally, in Fig. 18 we show the temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering measured at the (\frac{1}{2}\!\downarrow\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  for layers that are properly matched (e.g., ferromagnetic spins along c if J_{c}>0) and the plus sign is for layers that are mismatched. Thus even if the interlayer coupling is very weak, there is an energy difference \simJ_{c}N between the "correct" and the "wrong" spin configurations, and this energy can be quite large, since N is large. Hence as soon as 2D order is close to being established, an ordering should be induced along the c axis. Therefore, if dipole interactions were the dominant interaction between the layers, then we would not expect to observe the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) spin configuration where spins are coupled antiferromagnetically along c. This suggests that there is a competing interaction (competing with an already weak dipole interaction) between Dy ions which favors an antiferromagnetic coupling along the c axis. In fact, Liu[24] has developed a model using a modified RKKY interaction involving electrons at energies away from the Fermi level, which can stabilize the three-dimensional magnetic order of the rare earth moments in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}, and favors antiferromagnetism.

When oxygen is removed and we get to a yet undetermined concentration 0.54<x<1 we find that the spins are coupled in their preferred dipole configuration of being parallel along c. Now the competing interaction appears to have lost out to the dipole interaction, indicating that the competing interaction is affected by oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies in the lattice may also weaken the interactions in the plane enough to account for the lowering of T_{N}. And since we find that T_{N} falls off faster with x in the nonsuperconducting phase, where the Cu spins order, it is possible that the Cu order influences the Dy spins, as Mossbauer experiments on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} and YbBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} (Ref. [25]) have indicated that there is a weak anomalous Cu molecular field at the rare-earth site.

## VIII Experimental results on NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}

### Neutron scattering

In Fig. 19, we show a low-temperature angular scan through the 3D magnetic Bragg peak (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) taken on our highest oxygenated superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6,94} sample, while the inset displays the corresponding 3D spin structure for this oxygen concentration. All the observed magnetic Bragg peaks can be indexed by half-integral Miller indices. The indexing of the magnetic Bragg peaks indicates that the magnetic unit cell is doubled along all three crystallographic directions, and thus the spins are coupled antiferromagnetically along all three axes. The data were taken well below the ordering temperature of T_{N} \simeq 0.53 K, where the ordering is well developed. When 3D long-range order occurs we expect to see resolution limited 3D magnetic Bragg peaks below T_{N}, thus the solid curve through the data is a fit to the Gaussian resolution function. These measurements reproduce the results taken on polycrystalline NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} of Ref. [7].

For the NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} system all the measurements were carried out on powder samples in order to assure uniformity of oxygen. We now discuss the methods used to quantitatively analyze the powder data. Figure 20(a) shows a representative scattering plane for a system with 3D order. The solid points denote the Bragg points for the case of a single-crystal sample. To observe a single-crystal Bragg peak, we must have the scattering vector {\bf Q} = \tau a reciprocal-lattice vector, that is, the neutron detector must be at the correct scattering angle 2\theta_{hkl} [with \tau = (4\pi/\lambda)sin\theta_{hkl}], and the sample must be rotated to the proper orientation. A powder sample, on the other hand, consists of a large number of single crystals, randomly oriented. This has the effect of transforming each Bragg point into a Bragg sphere of radius \tau, and the projection of these spheres onto the scattering plane yields a series of concentric circles as also shown in Fig. 20(a). The sample orientation is now irrelevant, and the measured Bragg angle 2\theta_{hkl} yields \tau.

We have clearly demonstrated the 2D nature of the rare-earth magnetism in DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. For Nd we also expect the diffuse scattering above T_{N} to display dominantly 2D behavior. Thus, in Fig. 20(b) we show the positions of the Bragg rods associated with this 2D character. Note that in order to observe the rod, we can measure at any value of Q we like, as long as we scan through the rod, and as long as Q exceeds the minimum length Q_{\rm min}. For a powder, we must average over all possible orientations of reciprocal space. Note that unlike the 3D case, where the Bragg points define discrete spheres, the scattering from the rod is distributed over an infinite range in Q; there is a minimum (Q_{\rm min}) below which we will not observe any rod scattering, but there is no maximum. Thus, in the case of powder diffraction there will be a density of states associated with the rod scattering, as illustrated in Fig. 20(c). This situation was analyzed by Warren many years ago for the case of x-ray powder patterns of random layered materials.[29, 18] In Fig.

Figure 19: Low-temperature angular scan through the 3D magnetic Bragg peak (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) measured on our highest oxygenated NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6,94} sample. The solid curve is a fit to the Gaussian resolution, indicating that 3D long-range order has been reached. The inset shows the 3D ground-state spin structure.

  21(a), we show a scattering profile just above the ordering temperature for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}. The solid curve is a least-squares fit to a 2D model, which assumes there is a rod of magnetic scattering characterized by the 2D reciprocal-lattice vector \tau_{\rm 2D}=(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}). To generate the fitted curve we use Warren's approach[29] of averaging the scattered intensity for a 2D powder over all possible orientations of reciprocal space, but here we assume the intrinsic line shape to the rod is Lorentzian rather than Gaussian as assumed in his case. This is appropriate for diffuse magnetic scattering where the 2D rod is propor

  tional to the spin-spin correlation function, which in the Ornstein-Zernike approximation is given by Eq. (1). We then get for the scattering intensity

\[I_{hk} = {\rm const} \times \frac{|F_{M}|^{2}}{{\rm sin}\theta}F(\theta)\ ,\]

where 2_th_ is the scattering angle, F_{M} is the magnetic structure factor for the 2D magnetic unit cell,18 and

\[F(\theta) = \int_{{\rm Ewald\ sphere}}\frac{\kappa^{2}}{(q^{2} + \kappa^{2})}\frac{dA}{{\rm sin}\theta}\]

represents the scattering from the rod summed over the surface of the Ewald sphere of radius Q. For convenience we make a change of variables q^{2} = q_{x}^{2} + q_{y}^{2} = k_{\parallel}^{2} + k_{\parallel}^{2}, where _k__{\parallel} and _k__{\perp} are orthogonal variables such that k_{\parallel} = ({\bf Q} - \tau_{2{\rm D}}) \cdot \hat{\tau}_{2{\rm D}} is the component of {\bf Q} - \tau_{2{\rm D}} along \hat{\tau}_{2{\rm D}}, which in the case of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6 + x} is the (110) direction, as depicted in Fig. 20. We now approximate by replacing the Ewald spherical shell by the tangent cylindrical shell of radius Q and cylinder axis along the _k__{\perp} direction. This is a reasonable approximation since the integrand \sim 1/k_{\perp}^{2}. Equation (5) can now be written as

\[F(\theta) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\kappa^{2}}{(k_{ \perp}^{2} + k_{\parallel}^{2} + \kappa^{2})}dk_{\perp}\frac{Qd\phi}{{\rm sin}\theta}\ .\]

The integral over _k__{\perp} can be carried out, and using Q = (4\pi/\lambda){\rm sin}\theta, the fact that _ph_ is the angle between **Q** and \tau_{2{\rm D}}, and

\[k_{\parallel} = ({\bf Q} - \tau_{2{\rm D}}) \cdot \hat{\tau}_{2{\rm D}} = Q\cos\phi - \tau_{2{\rm D}}\] (7) \[= \frac{4\pi}{\lambda}({\rm sin}\theta\cos\phi - {\rm sin}\theta_{kk})\]

we get

\[F(\theta) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{4\pi^{2}\kappa^{2}}{\lambda} \left[\frac{16\pi^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}({\rm sin}\theta\cos\phi - {\rm sin}\theta_{kk})^{2}\right.\] (8) \[\left. + \kappa^{2}\right]^{-1/2}d\phi\ ,\]

where 2_th__{kk} is the scattering angle where the Ewald sphere first intercepts the rod [i.e., \tau_{2{\rm D}} = (4\pi/\lambda){\rm sin}\theta_{kk}], \lambda is the neutron wavelength, and the integral is solved numerically. A finite correlation length will give the rods a certain "thickness," and this will manifest itself in the intrinsic Lorentzian character of the measured spin-spin correlation function. The fit in Fig. 21(a) is very good, indicating that just above T_{N} the 2D correlations are strong. This does not rule out the possibility of there being weak correlations along the c axis above T_{N}, as it is difficult to resolve the _c_-axis correlations in this type of measurement. However, if they exist they are not very pronounced, as there is no clear indication of peaks arising at the 3D positions in this angular range (the positions of relevant 3D peaks will be discussed below). Also shown in Fig. 21 is a measurement taken on our partially deoxygenated superconducting sample NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78}. Figure 21(b) is a scan taken at low temperature on this powder, and the solid curve is a least-squares fit to Eq. (4). Quite unexpectedly, we find at low temperatures, where the magnetic scattering has already saturated in intensity, that it is still _only_ short range in nature, arising from 2D short-range magnetic correlations. The 2D correlation length we extract at T = 0.3 K is only 22 A. If the size of magnetic domains in the sample is comparable to or smaller than the intrinsic spin-spin correlation length, i.e., over the finite length scale of a magnetic domain the spins are correlated, then the rods will have a certain "thickness" which is Gaussian in its distribution. This is similar to the situation Warren considered for the case of x-ray powder patterns of layered materials,29 and Zhang _et al._ considered for powder samples of the 2D magnetic system Dy_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{3}O_{15}.18 Warren's calculation29 assuming a Gaussian line shape to the 2D rod yields

\[F(\theta) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\exp\left[ - \frac{4\pi L^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}({\rm sin}\theta\cos\phi - {\rm sin}\theta_{kk})^{2}\right]d\phi\ ,\]

where L is a parameter that represents the size of a 2D magnetic domain:

\[L = [(1/N_{x}a)^{2} + (1/N_{y}b)^{2}]^{-1/2}\ ,\]

and (_N__x_a_ \times N_{y}b) is the area of a domain in the _ab_ plane. In Fig. 21(c), we show the same data as in Fig. 21(b), with the important difference that here we have least-squares fit the data assuming a Gaussian shape to the 2D rod of scattering [Eqs. (4) and (9)]. We find from our fit that the 2D domain size at T = 0.3 K is only L = 24 A, where we now assume the intrinsic 2D spin-spin correlation length x is large compared to the domain size L, i.e., x >>_L_. The fits in Figs. 21(b) and 21(c) are very comparable, as we find from our least-squares fit that for the Lorentzian rod (domain size L >>spin-spin correlation length x = 1.13, and for the Gaussian rod (intrinsic spin-spin correlation length x >>domain size _L_) the fit is slightly improved with x = 0.98. Due to the weak nature of the magnetic scattering intensity from a sample with spins correlated over such small length scales, it is difficult to determine which model best represents the data. However, Allensbach, Maple, and Furrer4 have had reasonable success fitting the Nd magnetic specific-heat data of partially deoxygenated superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.72} using a 2D spin cluster model, which assumes finite-size clusters, on the order of a few lattice spacings, of correlated spins (we will say more about the specific-heat results in a later section). This suggests that the finite-size magnetic domain model we used above may be more appropriate for the magnetic order of Nd in partially deoxygenated superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78}. We emphasize that this is not the appropriate model for our fully oxygenated sample, NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, above its ordering temperature, and this is evidenced by the fact that the fit in Fig. 21(a) assuming a Lorentzian line shape to the rod gives us a significantly better fit than we can achieve assuming a Gaussian line shape.

The temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering measured at the (\frac{1}

  NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78} compound is shown in Fig. 22. The magnetic scattering develops at the relatively high temperature of 1.5 K, and is seen to saturate at about 0.4 K. It is rather remarkable that this magnetic scattering is now developing at temperatures about three times higher than observed in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, even though long-range order never develops.

A low-temperature scan taken on the nonsuperconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.45} sample is shown in Fig. 23(a), where we can now clearly resolve two peaks at the 3D Bragg positions (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}). At this temperature the scattering intensity has already saturated, yet the two peaks are still considerably broader than the resolution. This indicates that the correlations along the c axis are considerably stronger than what we observed in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78}, but 3D long-range order is still absent.

In Fig. 23(b), we show an angular scan, over the same angular range as in Fig. 23(a), taken at low temperatures on our sample with the lowest oxygen stoichiometry of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13}. The important difference between these results and those of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.45} is that in Fig. 23(b) the two peaks are resolution-limited magnetic Bragg peaks, indicating that long-range order of the Nd ions develops in this compound. However, the relative intensities of the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) peaks differ from what we observed for the same peaks in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7},[7] where \mu\parallelc. We also observe a strong (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{5}{2}) peak for the deoxygenated samples, which was quite weak in our NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}, data. In fact, for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13} we can model the data very well if we assume the moment direction is off the c axis by 45^{*}. We also find an ordered moment, \langle\mu_{x}\rangle\,\simeq(0.85\pm0.04)\mu_{B}, which is reduced by about 20% from what we estimate for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, where \langle\mu_{x}\rangle\,\simeq\,1.1\mu_{B}.[7] However, the Nd ordering in the insulating phase could be complicated by the Cu order, and may account for some of these differences. The experimental intensities and some calculated values are listed in Table 1.

Finally, we show in Fig. 24 the temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering measured at the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) position for two different oxygen concentrations, NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13} and NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}. From the figure we see that the transition temperatures differ by about a factor of 3, where for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13} we find T_{N}\,\simeq\,1.75 K and for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}T_{N}\,\simeq\,0.53 K.

We have not made comparisons of the scattering data with any known model such as the 2D S\,=\frac{1}{2} Ising model, as has been commonly done with the rare-earth order in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. As we have discussed in previous arti

The 3D correlations are only short range in nature. (b) A similar low-temperature scan taken on insulating NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13}. The data reveal sharp resolution-limited Bragg peaks, indicating that 3D long-range order is restored for this oxygen concentration.

  cles,[3, 30] this is due to the nature of magnetic scattering in powder samples, where it is impossible to separate the elastic Bragg component of the scattering from the diffuse scattering without measuring the energy dependence. For instance, the thermodynamic order parameter (sublattice magnetization) is determined from the Bragg scattering, while the susceptibility is derived from the diffuse scattering. Since we are unable to separate the two components of the scattering, we are limited to observing the qualitative nature of the magnetic order. Future experiments made on single-crystal samples should circumvent this difficulty.[30]

### Specific-heat measurements

In Fig. 25, we show magnetic specific-heat C(T) data taken over the range of oxygen concentration 0.26 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.93, from Ref. 28. For NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} we see that there is a sharp specific-heat anomaly near 0.5 K, in agreement with the neutron results.[7] As oxygen is removed we see that the peak in C(T) is rounded, although as more oxygen is removed the peak gets somewhat sharper and occurs at a progressively higher temperature. At x\simeq 0.3, the anomaly is again very sharp, and the transition is at the relatively high temperature of T\simeq 1.75 K, again in excellent agreement with the neutron results. Hence, both experimental techniques show the same striking oxygen dependence to the magnetic ordering. Lastly, we note that the specific-heat curve in Fig. 25, at high oxygen concentration (x\gtrsim 0.9), can be fit by an anisotropic 2D S=\frac{1}{2} Ising model, while at lower concentration the curves are qualitatively described by a 2D Heisenberg system (exhibiting no transition to long-range order), and finally for x\lesssim 0.3 the curves are again Ising like.

## IX Discussion of the N\alpha results

The ordering temperatures for both the fully oxygenated (0.53 K) sample and the deoxygenated sample (1.75 K) are much higher than expected based on dipole interactions alone and a Nd moment \mu_{\rm Nd}\approx 1\mu_{B}. Consider that for a dipole interaction we have T_{N}\propto\mu^{2}, and for Dy in DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, whose ordering temperature (0.93 K) is well estimated from dipole calculations, \mu_{\rm Dy}\approx 7\mu_{B}\approx 7(\mu_{\rm Nd}), as discussed above.[3] This would imply, from dipole considerations alone, that the ordering temperature for Nd should be at least 50 times lower than that of Dy, yet they both order at temperatures near 1 K. In view of our experimental results, as well as the inability of dipole interactions to yield such high ordering temperatures, there must be an additional magnetic interaction

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} (hkl) & I_{\rm obs} & I_{\rm calc} (c axis) & I_{\rm calc} (45^{\prime} off c axis) \\ \hline NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} & & & \\ (\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2}) & \equiv 1.00\pm 0.03 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\ (\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{3}{2}) & 0.40\pm 0.03 & 0.50 & 0.65 \\ (\frac{1}{2}  between rare-earth ions, and this interaction must involve the chain layer oxygen ions since T_{N} varies drastically with x. The specific-heat results on NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} can also be better understood in terms of such a coupling. The NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} data in Fig. 25 fit very nicely to an anisotropic 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising model, and a strong coupling of the Nd spins via the chain layer could be the origin of this anisotropy.

Inelastic neutron-scattering measurements indicate that the crystal-field magnetic ground state of Nd is effectively unchanged over the whole range of oxygen concentration, 0\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!1[31]. However, single-ion crystal-field calculations do reveal that the easy magnetic axis goes from the c axis in fully oxygenated NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} to isotropic behavior close to x\!\simeq\!0.8, and by further reducing the oxygen concentration the a axis becomes the easy magnetic axis [31]. The change in the easy axis of magnetization may explain why we see a change in the moment direction from parallel to c (\mu\parallelc) in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, to \approx\!45^{\circ} off the c axis for our deoxygenated insulating samples with x\!\leq\!0.3. Also, if the moment direction is truly isotropic near x\!\simeq\!0.8, then a 2D Heisenberg model would be appropriate and this would explain the loss of long-range order. Recent work by Allenspach, Maple, and Furrer [4] lends support to the Nd spins being 2D Heisenberg-like near x\!\simeq\!0.8, as they have had reasonable success fitting the magnetic specific-heat data at x\!\simeq\!0.72 with a 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg cluster model. More quantitative work is needed to determine if, indeed, this is a mechanism for any of the oxygen dependence of the Nd ordering we see.

A summary of our results on the oxygen dependence of the rare-earth magnetic order is given in Table 2. We have found that all three rare-earth magnetic systems are very sensitive to the chain layer oxygen concentration. This is somewhat surprising considering the generally accepted view that the rare-earth ions are electronically isolated from the superconducting Cu-O planes [1]. Even more remarkable is the fact that the rare-earth magnetism of all of the materials we studied has a different oxygen dependence. ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} displays 3D long-range order, and as oxygen is removed T_{N} decreases until in nominally oxygenated insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) only 2D short magnetic correlations are observed. In DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}T_{N} also decreases with oxygen, but the spin structure changes with oxygen content as well, going from antiparallel along the c axis (x\!\simeq\!1), to parallel while still in the superconducting phase (x\!<\!1). In NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}T_{N}_increases_ threefold as oxygen is reduced from x\!\simeq\!1 (T_{N}\!=\!0.53 K) to x\!\lesssim\!0.3 (T_{N}\!\approx\!1.5 K), while only short-range order is observed for 0.3\!<\!x\!<\!1. Also, while T_{N} for ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} and DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} is fairly well estimated by dipole interactions, in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}T_{N} is at least 50 times larger than dipole estimates. These results demonstrate unambiguously that dipole interactions are incapable of explaining the variety of magnetic structures and Neel temperatures observed, and that there is a significant coupling between the chain layer oxygen and the rare-earth magnetism. More studies will be required to fully elucidate the nature of this coupling.

###### Abstract

Neutron diffraction has been used to study the effects of oxygen on the magnetic order of the rare-earth ions in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (R = Dy, Er, Nd). For fully oxygenated superconducting (T_{c} = 92 K) ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, two-dimensional (2D) short-range magnetic correlations are observed just above the ordering temperature T_{N} = 0.62 K, while at T_{N} long-range correlations develop in the _a_-_b_ plane, inducing 3D long-range order. Below T_{N} the sublattice magnetization is found to obey Onsager's exact solution of the 2D S = \frac{1}{2} Ising model. For oxygen-reduced (x = 0.6) superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}, the 3D ordering temperature is lowered to T_{N} \approx 0.48 K. For insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x \approx 0) _neither_ 2D nor 3D long-range order develops, as _only_ 2D short-range correlations are observed. For DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (T_{c} \simeq 92 K) 3D long-range order occurs at T_{N} \approx 0.93 K, with spins coupled antiferromagnetically along all three crystallographic axes. As we reduce the oxygen concentration the 3D magnetic ordering temperature decreases. In addition, for a concentration 0.54 \leq x_{c} < 1, still in the superconducting phase, the spin configuration changes along the _c_-axis to ferromagnetic. In the insulating phase, x \lesssim 0.4, we observe _both_ 2D and 3D diffuse scattering developing below 2 K, but 3D long-range order never occurs. In our highest oxygenated NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94} (T_{c} \simeq 92 K), 3D long-range order develops below T_{N} \simeq 0.53 K. For a small reduction of oxygen to x = 0.78, we observe drastic effects on the Nd order as _only_ short-range 2D correlations are found at low temperatures. At nonsuperconducting x = 0.45, 3D correlations develop at low temperatures, yet long-range order still does not occur. For x = 0.3, 3D long-range order is reesta-blished, developing below T_{N} \approx 1.5 K, three times that of the fully oxygenated material. Though the oxygen dependence of the rare-earth magnetism varies between the three compounds we have studied, our results indicate there is significant coupling between the chain layer oxygen and the rare-earth ions in each case.

## I Introduction

The rare-earth magnetic interactions in the R 123 systems have generally been considered to be rather simple. This notion was motivated partly by early experiments which showed that substitution of other rare earths for yttrium in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} did not affect superconductivity, suggesting that the rare-earth sublattice is electronically isolated from the superconducting Cu-O planes.[1] In addition, the ordering temperatures for the magnetic rare earths are near 1 K, which for the heavy rare earths is in the range where magnetic dipole-dipole interactions are important, and this also suggests that the rare-earth ions are isolated. This picture is consistent with measurements which found no difference in the magnetic order of Gd in fully deoxygenated GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} as compared to fully oxygenated GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[11] However, more recent specific-heat and neutron-scattering measurements on the oxygen dependence of the magnetic order of Er,[2, 3] Dy,[3, 4] and Nd (Refs. [3] and [5]) have indicated that chain layer oxygen vacancies affects the rare-earth magnetic order.

We will show in this work that indeed oxygen has a strong influence on the magnetic order of rare-earth ions. In going from fully oxygenated superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} to nominally oxygenated insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x \approx 0) we go from a rare-earth system that exhibits three-dimensional (3D) long-range order at low temperature to a system with only 2D short-range magnetic correlations at the lowest achievable temperatures (T = 60 mK). We have made measurements on single crystals with three different oxygen concentrations: fully oxygenated x \approx 1, partially deoxygenated x \approx 0.6, and nominally oxygenated x \approx 0.

In addition, we have made measurements on several single crystals as well as powder samples of DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} over the full range of oxygen concentra  tions 0\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,1. For fully oxygenated, superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} we observe the 2D and 3D magnetic nature of the Dy order, analogous to the magnetic behavior of Er observed in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[6] Long-range order develops at T_{N}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.93 K with Dy spins coupled antiferromagnetically along all three crystallographic axes, while above T_{N} we observe a rod of scattering, characteristic of 2D behavior. As the oxygen concentration is reduced the ordering temperature decreases, and at an oxygen concentration still in the superconducting phase the spin configuration changes along the c axis to ferromagnetic. For x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{<}}{{\sim}}$}\,0, where the Cu spins also exhibit long-range antiferromagnetic order, the magnetic behavior is drastically altered. Quite unexpectedly, _both_ 2D and 3D magnetic correlations develop below \approx 2 K, but 3D long-range order never develops even though the 2D correlations become long range within our experimental resolution.

Finally, we report our results from neutron-scattering and specific-heat measurements on the oxygen dependence of the magnetic order of Nd in powder samples of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.94, 0.78, 0.45, 0.3, 0.13). For our highest oxygen concentration, superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, we found that the Nd ions develop 3D long-range magnetic order at T_{N}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.53 K, with spins coupled antiferromagnetically along the a, b, and c directions and the moment aligned along c.[7] The two experimental techniques at our disposal allow us to observe the manifestations of this long-range magnetic order in two forms: a sharp specific-heat anomaly, and resolution-limited magnetic Bragg peaks via neutron scattering. As we remove oxygen from this sample to arrive at partially deoxygenated superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.45} does not restore long-range order, though the magnetic scattering now indicates correlations along the c axis. With further reduction to NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.3}, we find that long-range order has been restored, as evidenced by a sharp specific-heat anomaly and resolution-limited magnetic Bragg peaks. The 3D configuration of spins is identical to what we observe in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, but we find that the ordering temperature is more than three times higher than for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, increasing to T_{N}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,1.5 K, and the moment direction is now canted off the c axis by \approx\,45^{\circ}. We note that preliminary results of our measurements on NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} have been reported earlier.[8]

## II Experimental conditions

The neutron experiments were performed at the research reactor at the National Institute of Standards and Technology on the triple-axis spectrometers BT-9 and BT-2. The scattering data were taken with a wavelength of 2.35 A, which corresponds to an incoming neutron energy of E_{i} = 14.8 meV, and a pyrolytic graphite monochromator and filter. Both a He^{3} and He dilution refrigerator were used for the low-temperature measurements. The ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} with x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0, and x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.6 single crystals were prepared using a modified self-flux technique.[9] The as-grown single crystals were annealed in N_{2} at 600 degC for about a week to reduce the oxygen content to ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0). SQUID magnetometer measurements on the annealed crystal revealed no diamagnetic signal down to 4.2 K. The same crystal was later annealed in O_{2} at 900 degC for about 2 h, and cooled to 500 degC at the rate of 50 degC/h, then very slowly cooled to room temperature at an average rate of 0.6 degC/h to achieve x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.6. SQUID magnetometer measurements on this crystal revealed a superconducting transition T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,75 K. The preparation of the fully oxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,1,T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,92 K) single crystal has been described in a previous article.[6]

The growth technique for the DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} single crystals has been described in a previous article.[10] The measured superconducting transition temperature for the fully oxygenated x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,1 crystal was T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,90 K, while that for our x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.54 powder sample was T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,50 K. We have made measurements on several different Dy123 single-crystal samples, ranging in weight from 2 to 250 mg, as well as a 13-g powder sample. A neutron profile refinement at a wavelength of 1.5453 A and collimation of 10^{\prime}-20^{\prime}-10^{\prime} was done on the BT-1 powder diffractometer to establish the oxygen stoichiometry of the Dy powder sample.

The preparation of the NdBa_{2}C_{3}O_{6+x} powder sample has been described in detail in a previous article.[5] A polycrystal sample was chosen so that the oxygen content could be readily determined and varied. A neutron profile refinement was done to establish the oxygen stoichiometry of the powder. The lowest achievable oxygen concentration for this sample was x\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.22, which results in partial occupation of the interchain O(5) site by oxygen.[11] The superconducting transition for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94} was T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,92 K, while that of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78} was T_{c}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,63 K.

## III Experimental results on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}

### Fully oxygenated superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}

We have discussed in previous articles[6] our study of the 2D and 3D magnetic behavior of fully oxygenated superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} using neutron-scattering techniques, so we will only briefly summarize our results here. Our measurements were made in the (h\,\,0\,\,l) scattering plane, where a rod of diffuse scattering is observed just below T\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,1 K, which is due to the 2D short-range magnetic correlations of Er spins. Below T_{N}\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,0.62 K the sublattice magnetization, which is a measure of the thermodynamic order parameter, is found to obey Onsager's exact solution of the 2D S\,\raisebox{-1.72pt}{$\stackrel{{=}}{{\sim}}$}\,\frac{1}{2} Ising model.[12, 13] The indexing of the 3D magnetic Bragg peak for the ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} crystal used in this study is of the (\frac{1}{2}O\frac{1}{2}) type, which corresponds to a ground-state spin configuration characterized by spins coupled antiferromagnetically along both the a and c directions, and ferromagnetically coupled spins along the b direction, with  the moments lying along b (see Fig. 1). This is the only spin configuration we have observed with this sample.

### Partially de-oxygenated superconducting ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}

Now we turn to our partially deoxygenated single crystal which we shall refer to as ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}. The sample is in the superconducting orthorhombic phase with an approximate oxygen concentration of x\approx 0.6. In Fig. 2, we show a low-temperature scan through the resolution-limited 3D magnetic Bragg peak, indexed as (\frac{1}{2},0,0), measured on the ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} crystal. This indexing is appropriate for spins aligned antiferromagnetically along the a axis, and ferromagnetically along the b and c directions. We have also determined the moment to be along the crystallographic b direction, as expected. Again this is the only ground-state configuration we observe in this sample, and this is a different single crystal than the one in which we observed the (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}) structure. We do not believe the different magnetic structures are due to the differing oxygen concentrations, since in fully oxygenated powder samples of our own, in the powder and single crystals of Chattopadhyay _et al._,[14] and the single crystals of Paul _et al._,[15] peaks with integer l are seen. The two possible Er spins structures are shown in Fig. 1.

In Fig. 3(a), we show a scan across the rod through the rod point (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ 0.3) at a temperature just above the 3D ordering temperature T_{N}\approx 0.48 K. This diffuse scattering is due to 2D short-range magnetic correlations in the a-b plane. The solid curve is a least-squares fit to a Lorentzian convoluted with the Gaussian resolution function. The Lorentzian shape of the intrinsic function is based on the Ornstein-Zernike approximation for the spin-spin correlation function. The diffuse magnetic scattering is then given by the spin-spin correlation function

\[\left[\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right]_{\rm diffuse} \propto \langle S(-\,{\bf q})S({\bf q})\rangle-\langle S(-\,{\bf q}) \rangle\langle S({\bf q})\rangle\] (1) \[\propto (q^{2}+\kappa^{2})^{-1}\ .\]

The half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the Lorentzian \kappa\ (=1/\xi) is the 2D inverse correlation length, {\bf q}=q_{x}\hat{a}^{\ast}+q_{y}\hat{b}^{\ast}=Q_{x}\hat{a}^{\ast}+Q_{y}\hat {b}^{\ast}-\tau_{\rm 2D} and \tau_{\rm 2D} is the 2D reciprocal-lattice vector, which for Er is given by (\frac{1}{2}\ 0). By fitting these data with the Ornstein-Zernike form we are able to extract the 2D correlations in the system at a given temperature, and in this way we can observe the evolution of the correlations in the a-b plane. At T_{N} the 2D correlations are long range and the peak becomes resolution limited. This has been discussed in detail for ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7},[16] as well as for prototypical 2D systems such as K_{2}NiF_{4}.[17] Also shown in this figure is a scan along the rod just above the ordering temperature. We see that the scattering intensity is independent of the momentum transfer Q_{z} along the c direction, indicating that there are essentially no correlations along the c axis in the system above T_{N}. Therefore we say that above

Figure 1: Observed spin structures of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. (a) Magnetic unit cell and 3D spin structure corresponding to (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ \frac{1}{2}) indexing of magnetic Bragg peaks and (b) spin structure corresponding to (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ 0) indexing. We observe the (\frac{1}{2}\ 0\ 0) structure in our ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} crystal.

  the system exhibits _only_ 2D short-range magnetic correlations in the _a-b_ plane. We remark that this is qualitatively the same behavior we observe in fully oxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

At the ordering temperature, when strong correlations develop in the _a-b_ plane, even a very weak interaction along the c direction is enough to induce 3D long-range order (see discussions in Refs. [6] and [16]. Therefore, below T_{N}, we measure the magnetic Bragg scattering at the 3D positions. The temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering for our partially deoxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} crystal is shown in Fig. 4, measured at the 3D magnetic Bragg position (\frac{1}{2} 0 0). We have also included in this figure the results for our fully oxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} crystal for comparison. From the figure we can see that the transition temperature in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6} has decreased markedly from that of ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The transition is also notably broader, but we found a distribution of oxygen concentrations in this sample which we believe is creating this effect. In the fully oxygenated multicrystals of Paul _et al._[15] they saw both the (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) structures, but with no discernible difference in the ordering temperatures of the two structures. Thus we believe the shift we observe in T_{N} is an oxygen effect. Indeed, the shift downward in transition temperature with decreasing oxygen concentration agrees qualitatively with the results of Maletta _et al._[19] on Er123 powder samples, where they also found that the ordered moment had decreased. Unfortunately, for these measurements only the He^{3} system was available, and thus we did not get to a low enough temperature to measure the fully ordered moment.

### Insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\approx 0)

The results of our measurements on a nominally oxygenated ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\approx 0) crystal are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 5(a) is a scan across the rod at our lowest achievable temperature (60 mK), and we see that the intensity peaks at the rod position. Again the solid curve is a least-squares fit to a Lorentzian intrinsic scattering function convoluted with the Gaussian resolution function, from which we find that even at this very low temperature this peak is not resolution limited. Indeed we extract a 2D correlation length of just 15 A at this temperature, so that the system is exhibiting only short-range order. In Fig. 5(b), we show a scan along the rod also at

Figure 4: Magnetic scattering intensity vs temperature measured at the (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) 3D magnetic Bragg point on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}, T_{N}\approx 0.48 K, as compared to measurements made on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} at the (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) 3D magnetic Bragg point, T_{N}= 0.62 K.

Figure 3: (a) Scan across the rod of scattering in reciprocal space at the rod point (\frac{1}{2} 0 0.3), showing the 2D character just above T_{N}= 0.48 K in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.6}. (b) A scan along the rod shows the scattering intensity does not vary significantly along Q_{z}, indicating there are no significant spin correlations between planes, even just above T_{N}. The slight decrease in intensity with increasing Q_{z} is due to the magnetic form factor.

  our lowest temperature, and we see that the diffuse intensity extended along Q_{z} is flat. In this scan we go through the 3D Bragg positions as well as points away from where the 3D Bragg points would lie, and yet there is no discernible change in the intensity. These results lead us to conclude that for ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) the Er spins exhibit _only_ 2D short-range magnetic order down to T\!=\!60 mK.

Finally, in Fig. 6 we have the temperature dependence of the diffuse magnetic scattering. The diffuse scattering develops below about 0.7 K, increasing continuously as we lower the temperature but never saturating down to our lowest achievable temperature of 60 mK.

The 2D spin configuration which corresponds to the indexing of the 2D scattering vector is shown as an inset to Fig. 6. This is the same 2D spin configuration as seen in the oxygenated samples above their respective ordering temperatures, with the important difference that now a\!=\!b. From our measurements we are not able to determine the preferred moment direction, but presumably it is still in the a-b plane (see Simizu _et al._ in Ref. [2]).

## IV Theoretical analysis: Er magnetic dipole interactions

The low ordering temperature for the Er system suggests a rather weakly interacting system of spins. An appropriate model for the Er interaction may therefore be a simple dipole-dipole interaction. The total (ground-state) energy for a system of fully ordered point dipoles can be obtained by summing over the individual dipole-dipole interactions:

\[E\!=\!-\sum_{i}^{\rm all spins}\sum_{j>i}\frac{3(\mu_{i}\!\cdot\!\hat{\tau}_{ ij})(\mu_{j}\!\cdot\!\hat{\tau}_{ij})\!-\!(\mu_{i}\!\cdot\!\mu_{j})}{r_{ij}^{3}}\ .\] (2)

Even though Eq. (2) assumes that the system is fully ordered (i.e., sufficiently low temperatures), a good order-of-magnitude estimate of the expected transition temperature can be made from it by finding the average energy per spin for N spins, E/N. We have made this calculation for ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and its two possible spin configurations. We use the measured \mu\!=\!4.9\mu_{B} and \mu\!\parallel\!\hat{\bf b}, a\!=\!3.82 A, b\!=\!3.88 A, and c\!=\!11.66 A, and find that the energy per spin converges very quickly (within 18% when summing over nearest neighbors only, and within 5% out

Figure 5: (a) Scan across the rod at the rod point (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) in nominally oxygenated insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) at T\!=\!60 mK. (b) A scan along the rod shows that the scattering intensity does not vary significantly along Q_{z}. The 2D correlations in the a-b plane are only short range, as we have determined \xi\!\simeq\!15 Ã… at T\!=\!60 mK.

Down to T\!=\!60 mK the scattering intensity does not saturate. Inset: the spin configuration in the a-b plane for tetragonal ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0). This is also the lowest-energy spin configuration, with the moment lying in the plane, based on dipole energy considerations.

  to next-nearest neighbors) to e \simeq\!-0.66 K ( \simeq\!T_{N} in K) for both the (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) spin configurations. This is in good agreement with the experimentally determined ordering temperature of T_{N}\!=\!0.62 K. Monte Carlo simulations of the Er order have been made assuming a 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising antiferromagnet with dipole interactions [20], where it is found that the ordering temperature is fairly close to the experimentally measured value, again indicating the importance of the dipole interaction.

Misra and Felsteiner have made detailed dipole calculations of the low-temperature (ordered) spin structure of Er in Er123 assuming dipole-dipole interactions, and they find that the two 3D structures observed (Fig. 1) are degenerate [21]. Since we observe only one structure or the other in a particular sample, this may indicate that the 3D spin structure in Er123 may be sensitive to defects in the samples such as the density of grain and twin boundaries, which somehow lift the degeneracy. The fact that both the (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) and (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) structures have been so readily observed in many different Er123 samples by various workers (our work as well as that of Refs. [14] and [15]), indicates that the (dipole) degeneracy is the likely explanation.

As might be expected since c\!\simeq\!3a, the contribution to Eq. (2) from spins in other layers is very small, indeed they are so small that the 3D structures characterized by (\frac{1}{2} 0 0) and (\frac{1}{2} 0 \frac{1}{2}) wave vectors are apparently degenerate. Thus we will treat only the two-dimensional Er spin system, as the 2D interactions are dominating the ordering. If we consider what happens when the system goes into its tetragonal phase, we put a\!=\!b and then assume the moment direction is somewhere in the a-b plane. For an exchange-only magnetic system this would be well described by a 2D XY model. However, for a dipole system the a-b symmetry increases from twofold in the orthorhombic phase to fourfold in the tetragonal phase rather than to a continuous symmetry. With the moment in the 2D plane we find from Eq. (2) that the lowest-energy dipole spin configuration is that in Fig. 6, which is also the experimentally observed configuration. The dominant contribution to the average energy per spin, as determined by Eq. (2), comes from its four nearest neighbors in the a-b plane, and for the spins lying in the plane with the spin configuration as in Fig. 6 we have

\[\varepsilon_{nn}\!=\!-\frac{6\mu^{2}}{a^{3}}(1\!-\!2\cos^{2}\!\theta)\ ,\] (3)

where \theta is the angle in the a-b plane between the moment direction and the axis along which the spins are coupled antiferromagnetically. From Eq. (3) we find that \varepsilon_{nn} has its minimum at \theta\!=\!90^{\circ}, when the moment lies along the axis with the spins coupled ferromagnetically as depicted in Fig. 7. Therefore, the angular dependence to \varepsilon_{nn} leads to an anisotropy in the plane, such that the moment prefers to be along the a, or equivalently along the b axis, and the moments coupled ferromagnetically along that direction.

The specific-heat data of Simizu _et al._[2] in orthorhombic ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\gtrsim\!0.3) fit very nicely to a 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising model, while in the tetragonal phase (x\!\lesssim\!0.3) the specific-heat peak was significantly broadened and fit more effectively to an XY model. The authors suggested this may be due to the removal of the anisotropy in the a-b plane, so that the Er spin, which is locked along the b axis in the orthorhombic phase, becomes an XY spin in the tetragonal phase. Though the observation of a broad specific anomaly in tetragonal Er123 (Ref. [2]) is consistent with the short-range order we observe in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!=\!0), from our analysis we see that the dipole interactions lead to a fourfold spin degeneracy rather than the continuous degeneracy of an XY model. Thus for the Er spins in tetragonal Er123, an XY model with continuous degeneracy is inappropriate. In theory the ground state of the dipole model is stable, and should exhibit long-range order at a temperature of the same order of magnitude as that for the 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising model [22]. With this in mind it is surprising that short-range order persists in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) down to temperatures which are more than an order-of-magnitude smaller than the T_{N} (=\!0.62 K) in the 2D Ising like ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

## V Discussion of the Er results

Specific-heat results [2] indicate that the crystal-field ground state remains a doublet for 0 \lesssim\!x\!\lesssim\!1 in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. Our own inelastic neutron-scattering experiments reveal that the lowest-energy crystal-field excitations are at 9.32 and 10.99 meV for the fully oxygenated sample, and they shift down to 7.06 and 10.97 meV for the fully deoxygenated system. The energy of the first excited state is large enough over the entire oxygen range that only the ground doublet should contribute appreciably to the free energy in the vicinity of T_{N}. Thus the Er^{3+} ions in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} compounds can be treated as effectively S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} particles over the entire oxygen range. However, we believe that further crystal-field measurements for more values of x in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}, 0\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!1, would be enlightening. Since the crystal-field ground state of the Er^{3+} ions is unaffected by oxygen concentration, the effects we observe must be due to changes in the magnetic interactions between Er ions.

Though the rare earths are likely electronically decoupled from the Cu-O planes on the order of T_{c} perhaps they are not decoupled on the order of T_{N} (<\!<\!T_{c}). With this in mind, a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida

Figure 7: The lowest-energy spin structure, with the moment in the plane, for dipole interactions. The fact that there is an easy axis for the moment direction rules out the possibility of the Er spins being described by an isotropic XY model in the tetragonal phase.

  (**RKKY**) indirect exchange interaction between Er ions is possible, and presumably would be affected by oxygen concentration. **A RKKY** interaction has also been proposed theoretically[23,24] to explain neutron-scattering measurements, on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, for instance. However, there is still only limited experimental evidence that **a** RKKY interaction plays a role (Ref. [23], and references therein).

If there is an indirect coupling between the Er ions and the chain layer then the removal of oxygen could disrupt the Er spin interactions, reducing the average Er magnetic moment per site, and thus lowering the ordering temperature (recall from above k_{B}T_{N}\!\approx\!\epsilon\!\propto\!\mu^{2}). This will persist through the tetragonal phase where the Cu begins to order. The Cu order has not been considered to influence the rare earths in the 123 system, since the rare earths are believed to be at a symmetry site where all Cu magnetic interactions cancel. However, recent Mossbauer measurements on Er^{3+} diluted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} indicate an anomalous molecular field of B_{{\rm Cu}(2)}\!=\!200 G at the Er site due to the magnetic order of the Cu(2) in the Cu-O planes, and similar experiments on Yb^{3+} diluted into YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} indicate an even larger field of B_{{\rm Cu}(2)}\!=\!1600 G at the Yb site.[25] The size of the field at the Er site is about an order-of-magnitude smaller than the (saturated) Er dipole field, though the field found at the Yb site is about the same order of magnitude (comparing \epsilon_{m}\!=\!-6\mu^{2}/a^{3} with \mu\!\cdot\!B_{{\rm Cu}(2)}). With this range of field strengths observed at the rare-earth site it is possible that a Cu molecular field and the Er dipole field are competing interactions. This anomalous Cu molecular field, along with an indirect coupling of Er to the chain layer oxygen, may explain the diminishing magnetic order of Er as oxygen concentration decreases in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}.

## VI Experimental results on DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}

### The 2D rod of magnetic scattering in Dy123

In our scattering experiments on single-crystal samples of Dy123 the measurements were made in the (_h h 1_) scattering plane. In Fig. 8, we present a diagram of reciprocal space, showing the positions of the 3D nuclear (crystal structure) and magnetic (spin structure) Bragg points, as well as the Bragg rods associated with 2D character. We have noted in this figure the positions of the magnetic Bragg points associated with the two oxygen-dependent spin structures. The rods of scattering extend along the (Q_{z}) direction in reciprocal space where the magnetic interactions are weakest, and thus the correlations along the c axis are inhibited. The anisotropy of the rare-earth magnetic unit cell, where nearest neighbors along the c direction are three times as distant as in the _a-b_ plane, is the direct cause of the weak 3D interaction. Above the ordering temperature the rod intensity is due to short-range magnetic correlations in the _a-b_ plane, while below T_{N} it arises from low-energy magnetic excitations.

In Fig. 9(a), we show a scan across the rod of magnetic scattering, just above the 3D ordering temperature (T_{N}\!\approx\!0.9 K). These data are for a superconducting sample, and are typical of what we observe in our superconducting single crystals of DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. This strong rod of scattering develops for temperatures \la2 K, as will be discussed below. Since the HWHM of this peak is a direct measure of the inverse 2D correlation length \kappa, then by scanning across the rod at various temperatures we observe the evolution of the magnetic correlations in the _a-b_ plane. Also shown in this figure is a scan along the rod, which demonstrates that the scattering intensity is independent of Q_{z}. Hence above T_{N} there are no significant correlations between spins in adjacent _a-b_ planes, directly demonstrating that the c-axis interactions are very weak. The decrease in the scattering intensity Q_{z} we see in Fig. 9(b) is presumably due to the preferred c-axis alignment of the Dy spins, and the consequent suppression of the transverse magnetic fluctuations expected for an Ising-like system. There is also an additional fall off of intensity because of magnetic form factor effects.

### Fully oxygenated DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} single crystals

Figure 10 shows the intensity versus temperature at a point on the rod (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} 0.2) measured on our fully oxygenated superconducting sample DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The rod starts to develop below about 2 K, and the intensity steadily increases with decreasing temperature until it

Figure 8: (a) The scattering plane in reciprocal space showing the positions of 3D nuclear and magnetic Bragg points for the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) configuration as well as the 2D magnetic Bragg rods. (b) The scattering plane showing the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0)-type configuration of spins.

  peaks at T_{N}\!\simeq\!0.93 K, when long-range order sets in. Below T_{N} the intensity quickly decreases, presumably due to the sharp increase in the energy of the magnetic excitations, and the consequent decrease in their thermal population. This is what one would expect for an Ising-like system in which the transverse fluctuations are suppressed. Therefore, we may assume that the diffuse magnetic scattering intensity is primarily due to the longitudinal fluctuations of the Dy spins.

The temperature dependence of the inverse 2D correlations \kappa(T) is shown in Fig. 11. Each data point is extracted from a scan across the rod similar to that shown in Fig. 9(a). The data values for \kappa have been obtained by a deconvolution of the measured width of the rod, where we assume a Gaussian resolution function folded with a Lorentzian intrinsic function. As discussed earlier, the intrinsic function is based on the Ornstein-Zernike approximation for the spin-spin correlation function, as given in Eq. (1). The correlation length \xi_{\rm 2D} (=\!1/\kappa) grows continuously as the temperature is decreased, until at T_{N} the correlations are long range and the width of the rod is resolution limited. The solid curve is a fit to the power law (T\!-\!T_{N})^{0.9}. The exponent \nu\!=\!0.9 is within 10% of the critical exponent for the 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising model where in the limit T\!\to\!T_{N}, \kappa\!\sim\![(T\!-\!T_{N})^{/}T_{N}]^{\nu}, with \nu\!=\!1. When strong correlations develop in the a-b plane, 3D long-range order is also induced, so that below T_{N} the elastic component of the magnetic scattering arises at 3D Bragg points characterized by the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) wave vector, rather than a purely elastic component uniformly distributed along the rod.

The temperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization obtained from the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) 3D magnetic Bragg

  peak is shown in Fig. 12. The curve is quite sharp, a characteristic of the 2D magnetic nature of the system. However, we do not find quantitative agreement with the order parameter for a 2D S = \frac{1}{2} Ising model, in contrast to the behavior found in ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[3, 6, 16] In fact, we have taken measurements on a number of other Dy123 samples, and we found even broader curves but in no case did we find a sharper curve. This is somewhat surprising since magnetic specific-heat measurements on DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} display a logarithmic divergence at the ordering temperature in agreement with the 2D S = \frac{1}{2} Ising model. However, a small distribution of T_{N}'s in the neutron samples may be spoiling the quantitative agreement with the 2D Ising model. The spin structure for this oxygen concentration is also depicted here, where the spins are coupled antiferromagnetically along all three crystallographic directions and the moment is along the c axis. This is the same spin structure determined in the neutron-scattering experiments of Goldman _et al_.[26] and Fischer _et al_.[27] on powder samples of fully oxygenated superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

### Oxygen dependence of the spin configuration

Our data reveal that the magnetic structure along the c axis changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, depending on oxygen content. One might guess that the most likely concentration for the spin structure to change would be x \approx 0.4, where the system changes from metallic to semiconducting and where long-range magnetic order of the Cu moments occurs for x \lesssim 0.4. However, this turns out not to be the case, as we found that the structure had already changed at substantially higher x, in the superconducting regime.

To determine the oxygen concentration where the magnetic structure changes, we needed single crystals at intermediate x, with a uniform distribution of oxygen throughout the sample. Such uniformity turned out to be very difficult to obtain while controlling the value of x. We therefore decided to take data on a polycrystalline sample, where good oxygen uniformity could be readily obtained. The powder sample of DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} was made by the usual solid-state reaction techniques. The oxygen stoichiometry of the powder was established using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In addition, neutron powder diffraction data were obtained for one of the oxygen concentrations, and a full profile refinement was carried out to determine the absolute value of x. We obtained x = 0.54 \pm 0.03 for the sample with a measured T_{c} of 50 K. This refinement unambiguously established the oxygen content, and was in fact in excellent agreement with the TGA results starting from a "fully" oxygenated sample of x = 0.99 \pm 0.04 (TGA).

In Fig. 13(a), we show an angular scan at low temperature taken on this superconducting (T_{c} \simeq 50 K) DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.54} powder sample. In this angular range we observe the three magnetic Bragg peaks (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0), (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}1),

Figure 12: (a) Sublattice magnetization vs temperature obtained from the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) 3D magnetic Bragg peak, with T_{N} \simeq 0.93 K, measured on a single crystal of fully oxygenated DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The 3D configuration of spins appropriate for this oxygen concentration is also shown.

Figure 13: (Top) Low-temperature angular scan through the 3D magnetic Bragg peaks (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0), (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}1), and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}2), made on a powder sample of superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.54} (T_{c} \simeq 50 K). The integral values for l signify that nearest-neighbor spins along the c axis are parallel. (Bottom) An identical low-temperature scan taken after annealing the sample in O_{2} to get fully oxygenated DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. The Bragg peaks now arise at the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}l/2) positions (l odd), corresponding to antiferromagnetic spins along c. The appropriate spin structure is displayed to the right of its corresponding graph.

  and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}2), corresponding to spins coupled antiferromagnetically along the a and b directions, and ferromagnetically along the c axis. The spin structure is shown to the right, where we have determined the moment direction to be along the c axis just as for the fully oxygenated case. For comparison we show in Fig. 13(b) the same low-temperature angular scan taken on this powder after being annealed in O_{2}, increasing the oxygen concentration to x\simeq1 (DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}) and the superconducting transition to T_{c}\simeq90\mathbf{K}. Now we see the three magnetic Bragg peaks (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}), (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}), and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) corresponding to antiferromagnetically coupled spins along the c axis. Therefore, we see that removing oxygen changes the spin coupling along the c axis from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic while the system is still in the superconducting phase. These data establish that the magnetic structure changes in the range 0.54<x<1, though we have not determined the precise concentration where this change occurs.

As discussed above, in Fig. 9 we showed measurements of the rod made on a single crystal of superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. An analogous measurement on our DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.54} powder sample is shown in Fig. 14, where we show the magnetic scattering profile above the ordering temperature. The solid curve is a least-squares fit to a 2D model, which assumes there is a rod of magnetic scattering characterized by the 2D wave vector (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}). The model will be discussed in detail in a latter section, when we present our powder data on the Nd system. We are above the 3D T_{N} where the spins are only correlated in the plane, and thus the (2D) spin configuration is the same as at the higher oxygen concentrations.

### Effects of oxygen on the ordering temperature

We also find that creating oxygen vacancies in the chain layer lowers the ordering temperature. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 15, where we contrast the order parameter determined from the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) Bragg peak (T_{N}\simeq0.91\mathbf{K}, x\approx1) with that of the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0) peak (T_{N}\simeq0.87\mathbf{K}, x\approx0.54\  temperatures. However, in Fig. 9(b) the scattering intensity along the rod is flat, indicating that there are essentially no correlations along the c-axis above T_{N} for superconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0), while in Fig. 16(b) we see broad peaks at the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}l) positions, with l an integer, indicating that there are considerably stronger, though still short-range, correlations along the c direction above T_{N} in the DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) compound. Even at our lowest temperature of T\!=\!70 mK the widths of these 3D peaks, via a scan along the rod, as in Fig. 16(b), are about an order-of-magnitude larger than the resolution limit, while the widths derived from scans across the rod, as in Fig. 16(a), become resolution limited just below T\!=\!0.6 K. This is in sharp contrast to what occurs in the superconducting compounds, where a scan along the rod reveals resolution-limited magnetic Bragg peaks at low temperatures [T\!<\!T_{N}(3\mathrm{D})]. Again, there is the expected decrease in the scattering intensity for increasing Q_{z} in Fig. 16(b), which is presumably due to the preferred c-axis alignment of the Dy spins, and the consequent suppression of the transverse magnetic fluctuations expected for an Ising-like system. There is also the additional fall off of intensity due to magnetic form-factor effects.

We have measured the temperature dependence of the HWHM of the peak shown in Fig. 16(a), and the results are shown in Fig. 17(a). The data are the deconvolution of the measured width of the rod, where we assume a Gaussian resolution function folded with a Lorentzian intrinsic function as previously done. We know from Eq. (1) that this is the temperature dependence of the inverse 2D correlation length \kappa. Significant 2D correlations develop below about 2 K, and grow continuously until at T\!\approx\!0.55 K long-range correlations develop in the a-b plane, as is evidenced by resolution-limited peaks. The solid curve is a fit to the power law \kappa\!\sim\!(T\!-\!T_{N})^{1}, which is in good agreement with that expected for a 2D system as mentioned earlier.

In Fig. 17(b), we show the temperature dependence of the inverse correlations along the c direction, where the data were extracted from scans along the rod such as in

Figure 16: (a) Scan across the rod, near the 2D ordering temperature T_{N}(2\mathrm{D})\!\approx\!0.55 K, taken on a nominally oxygenated single crystal of nonsuperconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0). (b) Scan along the rod at a temperature near T_{N}(2\mathrm{D}). The 3D peaks develop on the rod below about 2 K, indicating that there are 3D correlations in the system before 2D long-range order in the a-b plane ever occurs.

Figure 17: (a) Temperature dependence of the 2D inverse correlations as measured on the nonsuperconducting DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) single crystal. The data are extracted from scans across the rod as in Fig. 16(a). The solid curve is a fit to the power law (T\!-\!T_{N})^{1} with T_{N}\!=\!0.55 K. (b) Temperature dependence of the c-axis inverse correlations. The data are extracted from scans along the rod (i.e., along Q_{z}). The low-temperature c-axis correlation length is \xi_{c}\!\approx\!13 Ã… (\approx\!c\!=\!11.85 Ã…).

  Fig. 16(b). The correlations along the c direction appear just below 2 K, and grow continuously, until at T\!=\!0.55\mathbf{K} they saturate at \xi_{c\text{-axis}}\!\approx\!13 A when 2D long-range correlations develop in the a-b plane. The fact that 3D long-range order never develops in this compound, even though the correlations in the plane are long range, is quite unexpected. The behavior is at variance to that of all known "2D magnets," in which 3D long-range order is induced as a necessary consequence of the onset of 2D long-range order. The only known exception to this is the Dy order in superconducting Dy_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{8}O_{16}.[18] However, in this compound there is a geometric cancellation of interactions between c-axis layers, which together with the weak intrinsic c-axis coupling renders the _net_ interaction along the c axis much smaller than all other "2D magnets." This is clearly not the case for DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0). The fact that we observe correlations along the c axis above T_{N} indicates that the coupling between layers is somehow enhanced.

Finally, in Fig. 18 we show the temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering measured at the (\frac{1}{2}\!\downarrow\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  for layers that are properly matched (e.g., ferromagnetic spins along c if J_{c}>0) and the plus sign is for layers that are mismatched. Thus even if the interlayer coupling is very weak, there is an energy difference \simJ_{c}N between the "correct" and the "wrong" spin configurations, and this energy can be quite large, since N is large. Hence as soon as 2D order is close to being established, an ordering should be induced along the c axis. Therefore, if dipole interactions were the dominant interaction between the layers, then we would not expect to observe the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) spin configuration where spins are coupled antiferromagnetically along c. This suggests that there is a competing interaction (competing with an already weak dipole interaction) between Dy ions which favors an antiferromagnetic coupling along the c axis. In fact, Liu[24] has developed a model using a modified RKKY interaction involving electrons at energies away from the Fermi level, which can stabilize the three-dimensional magnetic order of the rare earth moments in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}, and favors antiferromagnetism.

When oxygen is removed and we get to a yet undetermined concentration 0.54<x<1 we find that the spins are coupled in their preferred dipole configuration of being parallel along c. Now the competing interaction appears to have lost out to the dipole interaction, indicating that the competing interaction is affected by oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancies in the lattice may also weaken the interactions in the plane enough to account for the lowering of T_{N}. And since we find that T_{N} falls off faster with x in the nonsuperconducting phase, where the Cu spins order, it is possible that the Cu order influences the Dy spins, as Mossbauer experiments on ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} and YbBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} (Ref. [25]) have indicated that there is a weak anomalous Cu molecular field at the rare-earth site.

## VIII Experimental results on NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}

### Neutron scattering

In Fig. 19, we show a low-temperature angular scan through the 3D magnetic Bragg peak (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) taken on our highest oxygenated superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6,94} sample, while the inset displays the corresponding 3D spin structure for this oxygen concentration. All the observed magnetic Bragg peaks can be indexed by half-integral Miller indices. The indexing of the magnetic Bragg peaks indicates that the magnetic unit cell is doubled along all three crystallographic directions, and thus the spins are coupled antiferromagnetically along all three axes. The data were taken well below the ordering temperature of T_{N} \simeq 0.53 K, where the ordering is well developed. When 3D long-range order occurs we expect to see resolution limited 3D magnetic Bragg peaks below T_{N}, thus the solid curve through the data is a fit to the Gaussian resolution function. These measurements reproduce the results taken on polycrystalline NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} of Ref. [7].

For the NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} system all the measurements were carried out on powder samples in order to assure uniformity of oxygen. We now discuss the methods used to quantitatively analyze the powder data. Figure 20(a) shows a representative scattering plane for a system with 3D order. The solid points denote the Bragg points for the case of a single-crystal sample. To observe a single-crystal Bragg peak, we must have the scattering vector {\bf Q} = \tau a reciprocal-lattice vector, that is, the neutron detector must be at the correct scattering angle 2\theta_{hkl} [with \tau = (4\pi/\lambda)sin\theta_{hkl}], and the sample must be rotated to the proper orientation. A powder sample, on the other hand, consists of a large number of single crystals, randomly oriented. This has the effect of transforming each Bragg point into a Bragg sphere of radius \tau, and the projection of these spheres onto the scattering plane yields a series of concentric circles as also shown in Fig. 20(a). The sample orientation is now irrelevant, and the measured Bragg angle 2\theta_{hkl} yields \tau.

We have clearly demonstrated the 2D nature of the rare-earth magnetism in DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. For Nd we also expect the diffuse scattering above T_{N} to display dominantly 2D behavior. Thus, in Fig. 20(b) we show the positions of the Bragg rods associated with this 2D character. Note that in order to observe the rod, we can measure at any value of Q we like, as long as we scan through the rod, and as long as Q exceeds the minimum length Q_{\rm min}. For a powder, we must average over all possible orientations of reciprocal space. Note that unlike the 3D case, where the Bragg points define discrete spheres, the scattering from the rod is distributed over an infinite range in Q; there is a minimum (Q_{\rm min}) below which we will not observe any rod scattering, but there is no maximum. Thus, in the case of powder diffraction there will be a density of states associated with the rod scattering, as illustrated in Fig. 20(c). This situation was analyzed by Warren many years ago for the case of x-ray powder patterns of random layered materials.[29, 18] In Fig.

Figure 19: Low-temperature angular scan through the 3D magnetic Bragg peak (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) measured on our highest oxygenated NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6,94} sample. The solid curve is a fit to the Gaussian resolution, indicating that 3D long-range order has been reached. The inset shows the 3D ground-state spin structure.

  21(a), we show a scattering profile just above the ordering temperature for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}. The solid curve is a least-squares fit to a 2D model, which assumes there is a rod of magnetic scattering characterized by the 2D reciprocal-lattice vector \tau_{\rm 2D}=(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}). To generate the fitted curve we use Warren's approach[29] of averaging the scattered intensity for a 2D powder over all possible orientations of reciprocal space, but here we assume the intrinsic line shape to the rod is Lorentzian rather than Gaussian as assumed in his case. This is appropriate for diffuse magnetic scattering where the 2D rod is propor

For a powder the Bragg intensities are distributed on spheres, which appear as circles in this scattering plane.

  tional to the spin-spin correlation function, which in the Ornstein-Zernike approximation is given by Eq. (1). We then get for the scattering intensity

\[I_{hk} = {\rm const} \times \frac{|F_{M}|^{2}}{{\rm sin}\theta}F(\theta)\ ,\]

where 2_th_ is the scattering angle, F_{M} is the magnetic structure factor for the 2D magnetic unit cell,18 and

\[F(\theta) = \int_{{\rm Ewald\ sphere}}\frac{\kappa^{2}}{(q^{2} + \kappa^{2})}\frac{dA}{{\rm sin}\theta}\]

represents the scattering from the rod summed over the surface of the Ewald sphere of radius Q. For convenience we make a change of variables q^{2} = q_{x}^{2} + q_{y}^{2} = k_{\parallel}^{2} + k_{\parallel}^{2}, where _k__{\parallel} and _k__{\perp} are orthogonal variables such that k_{\parallel} = ({\bf Q} - \tau_{2{\rm D}}) \cdot \hat{\tau}_{2{\rm D}} is the component of {\bf Q} - \tau_{2{\rm D}} along \hat{\tau}_{2{\rm D}}, which in the case of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6 + x} is the (110) direction, as depicted in Fig. 20. We now approximate by replacing the Ewald spherical shell by the tangent cylindrical shell of radius Q and cylinder axis along the _k__{\perp} direction. This is a reasonable approximation since the integrand \sim 1/k_{\perp}^{2}. Equation (5) can now be written as

\[F(\theta) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\kappa^{2}}{(k_{ \perp}^{2} + k_{\parallel}^{2} + \kappa^{2})}dk_{\perp}\frac{Qd\phi}{{\rm sin}\theta}\ .\]

The integral over _k__{\perp} can be carried out, and using Q = (4\pi/\lambda){\rm sin}\theta, the fact that _ph_ is the angle between **Q** and \tau_{2{\rm D}}, and

\[k_{\parallel} = ({\bf Q} - \tau_{2{\rm D}}) \cdot \hat{\tau}_{2{\rm D}} = Q\cos\phi - \tau_{2{\rm D}}\] (7) \[= \frac{4\pi}{\lambda}({\rm sin}\theta\cos\phi - {\rm sin}\theta_{kk})\]

we get

\[F(\theta) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{4\pi^{2}\kappa^{2}}{\lambda} \left[\frac{16\pi^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}({\rm sin}\theta\cos\phi - {\rm sin}\theta_{kk})^{2}\right.\] (8) \[\left. + \kappa^{2}\right]^{-1/2}d\phi\ ,\]

where 2_th__{kk} is the scattering angle where the Ewald sphere first intercepts the rod [i.e., \tau_{2{\rm D}} = (4\pi/\lambda){\rm sin}\theta_{kk}], \lambda is the neutron wavelength, and the integral is solved numerically. A finite correlation length will give the rods a certain "thickness," and this will manifest itself in the intrinsic Lorentzian character of the measured spin-spin correlation function. The fit in Fig. 21(a) is very good, indicating that just above T_{N} the 2D correlations are strong. This does not rule out the possibility of there being weak correlations along the c axis above T_{N}, as it is difficult to resolve the _c_-axis correlations in this type of measurement. However, if they exist they are not very pronounced, as there is no clear indication of peaks arising at the 3D positions in this angular range (the positions of relevant 3D peaks will be discussed below). Also shown in Fig. 21 is a measurement taken on our partially deoxygenated superconducting sample NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78}. Figure 21(b) is a scan taken at low temperature on this powder, and the solid curve is a least-squares fit to Eq. (4). Quite unexpectedly, we find at low temperatures, where the magnetic scattering has already saturated in intensity, that it is still _only_ short range in nature, arising from 2D short-range magnetic correlations. The 2D correlation length we extract at T = 0.3 K is only 22 A. If the size of magnetic domains in the sample is comparable to or smaller than the intrinsic spin-spin correlation length, i.e., over the finite length scale of a magnetic domain the spins are correlated, then the rods will have a certain "thickness" which is Gaussian in its distribution. This is similar to the situation Warren considered for the case of x-ray powder patterns of layered materials,29 and Zhang _et al._ considered for powder samples of the 2D magnetic system Dy_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{3}O_{15}.18 Warren's calculation29 assuming a Gaussian line shape to the 2D rod yields

\[F(\theta) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2}\exp\left[ - \frac{4\pi L^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}({\rm sin}\theta\cos\phi - {\rm sin}\theta_{kk})^{2}\right]d\phi\ ,\]

where L is a parameter that represents the size of a 2D magnetic domain:

\[L = [(1/N_{x}a)^{2} + (1/N_{y}b)^{2}]^{-1/2}\ ,\]

and (_N__x_a_ \times N_{y}b) is the area of a domain in the _ab_ plane. In Fig. 21(c), we show the same data as in Fig. 21(b), with the important difference that here we have least-squares fit the data assuming a Gaussian shape to the 2D rod of scattering [Eqs. (4) and (9)]. We find from our fit that the 2D domain size at T = 0.3 K is only L = 24 A, where we now assume the intrinsic 2D spin-spin correlation length x is large compared to the domain size L, i.e., x >>_L_. The fits in Figs. 21(b) and 21(c) are very comparable, as we find from our least-squares fit that for the Lorentzian rod (domain size L >>spin-spin correlation length x = 1.13, and for the Gaussian rod (intrinsic spin-spin correlation length x >>domain size _L_) the fit is slightly improved with x = 0.98. Due to the weak nature of the magnetic scattering intensity from a sample with spins correlated over such small length scales, it is difficult to determine which model best represents the data. However, Allensbach, Maple, and Furrer4 have had reasonable success fitting the Nd magnetic specific-heat data of partially deoxygenated superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.72} using a 2D spin cluster model, which assumes finite-size clusters, on the order of a few lattice spacings, of correlated spins (we will say more about the specific-heat results in a later section). This suggests that the finite-size magnetic domain model we used above may be more appropriate for the magnetic order of Nd in partially deoxygenated superconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78}. We emphasize that this is not the appropriate model for our fully oxygenated sample, NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, above its ordering temperature, and this is evidenced by the fact that the fit in Fig. 21(a) assuming a Lorentzian line shape to the rod gives us a significantly better fit than we can achieve assuming a Gaussian line shape.

The temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering measured at the (\frac{1}

  NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78} compound is shown in Fig. 22. The magnetic scattering develops at the relatively high temperature of 1.5 K, and is seen to saturate at about 0.4 K. It is rather remarkable that this magnetic scattering is now developing at temperatures about three times higher than observed in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}, even though long-range order never develops.

A low-temperature scan taken on the nonsuperconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.45} sample is shown in Fig. 23(a), where we can now clearly resolve two peaks at the 3D Bragg positions (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}). At this temperature the scattering intensity has already saturated, yet the two peaks are still considerably broader than the resolution. This indicates that the correlations along the c axis are considerably stronger than what we observed in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.78}, but 3D long-range order is still absent.

In Fig. 23(b), we show an angular scan, over the same angular range as in Fig. 23(a), taken at low temperatures on our sample with the lowest oxygen stoichiometry of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13}. The important difference between these results and those of NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.45} is that in Fig. 23(b) the two peaks are resolution-limited magnetic Bragg peaks, indicating that long-range order of the Nd ions develops in this compound. However, the relative intensities of the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) peaks differ from what we observed for the same peaks in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7},[7] where \mu\parallelc. We also observe a strong (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{5}{2}) peak for the deoxygenated samples, which was quite weak in our NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6}, data. In fact, for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13} we can model the data very well if we assume the moment direction is off the c axis by 45^{*}. We also find an ordered moment, \langle\mu_{x}\rangle\,\simeq(0.85\pm0.04)\mu_{B}, which is reduced by about 20% from what we estimate for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, where \langle\mu_{x}\rangle\,\simeq\,1.1\mu_{B}.[7] However, the Nd ordering in the insulating phase could be complicated by the Cu order, and may account for some of these differences. The experimental intensities and some calculated values are listed in Table 1.

Finally, we show in Fig. 24 the temperature dependence of the magnetic scattering measured at the (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) position for two different oxygen concentrations, NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13} and NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}. From the figure we see that the transition temperatures differ by about a factor of 3, where for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13} we find T_{N}\,\simeq\,1.75 K and for NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.94}T_{N}\,\simeq\,0.53 K.

We have not made comparisons of the scattering data with any known model such as the 2D S\,=\frac{1}{2} Ising model, as has been commonly done with the rare-earth order in RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}. As we have discussed in previous arti

Figure 23: (a) Low-temperature angular scan through two 3D magnetic peaks indexed as (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}) and (\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{3}{2}), on the nonsuperconducting NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.45} sample. The 3D correlations are only short range in nature. (b) A similar low-temperature scan taken on insulating NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.13}. The data reveal sharp resolution-limited Bragg peaks, indicating that 3D long-range order is restored for this oxygen concentration.

  cles,[3, 30] this is due to the nature of magnetic scattering in powder samples, where it is impossible to separate the elastic Bragg component of the scattering from the diffuse scattering without measuring the energy dependence. For instance, the thermodynamic order parameter (sublattice magnetization) is determined from the Bragg scattering, while the susceptibility is derived from the diffuse scattering. Since we are unable to separate the two components of the scattering, we are limited to observing the qualitative nature of the magnetic order. Future experiments made on single-crystal samples should circumvent this difficulty.[30]

### Specific-heat measurements

In Fig. 25, we show magnetic specific-heat C(T) data taken over the range of oxygen concentration 0.26 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.93, from Ref. 28. For NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} we see that there is a sharp specific-heat anomaly near 0.5 K, in agreement with the neutron results.[7] As oxygen is removed we see that the peak in C(T) is rounded, although as more oxygen is removed the peak gets somewhat sharper and occurs at a progressively higher temperature. At x\simeq 0.3, the anomaly is again very sharp, and the transition is at the relatively high temperature of T\simeq 1.75 K, again in excellent agreement with the neutron results. Hence, both experimental techniques show the same striking oxygen dependence to the magnetic ordering. Lastly, we note that the specific-heat curve in Fig. 25, at high oxygen concentration (x\gtrsim 0.9), can be fit by an anisotropic 2D S=\frac{1}{2} Ising model, while at lower concentration the curves are qualitatively described by a 2D Heisenberg system (exhibiting no transition to long-range order), and finally for x\lesssim 0.3 the curves are again Ising like.

## IX Discussion of the N\alpha results

The ordering temperatures for both the fully oxygenated (0.53 K) sample and the deoxygenated sample (1.75 K) are much higher than expected based on dipole interactions alone and a Nd moment \mu_{\rm Nd}\approx 1\mu_{B}. Consider that for a dipole interaction we have T_{N}\propto\mu^{2}, and for Dy in DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, whose ordering temperature (0.93 K) is well estimated from dipole calculations, \mu_{\rm Dy}\approx 7\mu_{B}\approx 7(\mu_{\rm Nd}), as discussed above.[3] This would imply, from dipole considerations alone, that the ordering temperature for Nd should be at least 50 times lower than that of Dy, yet they both order at temperatures near 1 K. In view of our experimental results, as well as the inability of dipole interactions to yield such high ordering temperatures, there must be an additional magnetic interaction

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} (hkl) & I_{\rm obs} & I_{\rm calc} (c axis) & I_{\rm calc} (45^{\prime} off c axis) \\ \hline NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} & & & \\ (\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2}) & \equiv 1.00\pm 0.03 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\ (\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{3}{2}) & 0.40\pm 0.03 & 0.50 & 0.65 \\ (\frac{1}{2}  between rare-earth ions, and this interaction must involve the chain layer oxygen ions since T_{N} varies drastically with x. The specific-heat results on NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} can also be better understood in terms of such a coupling. The NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.93} data in Fig. 25 fit very nicely to an anisotropic 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Ising model, and a strong coupling of the Nd spins via the chain layer could be the origin of this anisotropy.

Inelastic neutron-scattering measurements indicate that the crystal-field magnetic ground state of Nd is effectively unchanged over the whole range of oxygen concentration, 0\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!1[31]. However, single-ion crystal-field calculations do reveal that the easy magnetic axis goes from the c axis in fully oxygenated NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} to isotropic behavior close to x\!\simeq\!0.8, and by further reducing the oxygen concentration the a axis becomes the easy magnetic axis [31]. The change in the easy axis of magnetization may explain why we see a change in the moment direction from parallel to c (\mu\parallelc) in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, to \approx\!45^{\circ} off the c axis for our deoxygenated insulating samples with x\!\leq\!0.3. Also, if the moment direction is truly isotropic near x\!\simeq\!0.8, then a 2D Heisenberg model would be appropriate and this would explain the loss of long-range order. Recent work by Allenspach, Maple, and Furrer [4] lends support to the Nd spins being 2D Heisenberg-like near x\!\simeq\!0.8, as they have had reasonable success fitting the magnetic specific-heat data at x\!\simeq\!0.72 with a 2D S\!=\!\frac{1}{2} Heisenberg cluster model. More quantitative work is needed to determine if, indeed, this is a mechanism for any of the oxygen dependence of the Nd ordering we see.

A summary of our results on the oxygen dependence of the rare-earth magnetic order is given in Table 2. We have found that all three rare-earth magnetic systems are very sensitive to the chain layer oxygen concentration. This is somewhat surprising considering the generally accepted view that the rare-earth ions are electronically isolated from the superconducting Cu-O planes [1]. Even more remarkable is the fact that the rare-earth magnetism of all of the materials we studied has a different oxygen dependence. ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} displays 3D long-range order, and as oxygen is removed T_{N} decreases until in nominally oxygenated insulating ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x\!\approx\!0) only 2D short magnetic correlations are observed. In DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}T_{N} also decreases with oxygen, but the spin structure changes with oxygen content as well, going from antiparallel along the c axis (x\!\simeq\!1), to parallel while still in the superconducting phase (x\!<\!1). In NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}T_{N}_increases_ threefold as oxygen is reduced from x\!\simeq\!1 (T_{N}\!=\!0.53 K) to x\!\lesssim\!0.3 (T_{N}\!\approx\!1.5 K), while only short-range order is observed for 0.3\!<\!x\!<\!1. Also, while T_{N} for ErBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} and DyBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} is fairly well estimated by dipole interactions, in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x}T_{N} is at least 50 times larger than dipole estimates. These results demonstrate unambiguously that dipole interactions are incapable of explaining the variety of magnetic structures and Neel temperatures observed, and that there is a significant coupling between the chain layer oxygen and the rare-earth magnetism. More studies will be required to fully elucidate the nature of this coupling.
