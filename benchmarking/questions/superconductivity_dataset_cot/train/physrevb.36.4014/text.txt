###### Abstract

Measurements of the resistivity, together with the longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistances of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) in extremely high fields up to 430 kG at different temperatures (4.2-300 K) are reported. It is shown that the application of a field as high as 430 kG does not destroy superconductivity at 50 K. Moreover, the resistance at 77 K and 430 kG does not approach the saturation limit and is only \(\sim\)50% of that of the normal phase. A large negative and anisotropic magnetoresistance \(\Delta\rho\) is observed at high temperature (\(T\!>\!100\) K). It is suggested that this behavior could be either of magnetic origin or due to some influence of the electromagnetic field on the short-range order of oxygen ions.

Since the recent discovery of a new class of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors,[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54  As in Ref. 6, it is of interest to ascribe the departure from linearity [curve _r_(_T_,0)] to the onset of superconducting effects near this temperature (110 K) and then check if this assumption is consistent with our magnetoresistance data around 110 K.

The transverse magnetoresistance \(\Delta\rho_{\perp}(T,H)\) at different constant temperatures is presented in Fig. 2. First of all, we observe that superconductivity at 50 K is not destroyed (within the present experimental precision) by the highest field applied here. This is _direct evidence that the upper critical field at 50 K is greater than 430 kG_ [_H__c_2(50 _K_) > 430 k_G_].

Also displayed in Fig. 2 is the transverse magnetoresistance at 77 K which is now different from zero. However, the most interesting feature of the 77 isotherm is that it does not saturate as a function of \(H\) even at 430 kG. This is perhaps best illustrated in Fig. 1 where the comparison of the curves \(\rho_{\perp}(T,200\) kG) and \(\rho_{\perp}(T,400\) kG), with the dashed lines representing the extrapolation of the normal-state resistivity to low temperatures, shows that \(\rho_{\perp}(77\) K, 400 kG) is only about half of the saturation limit which would be reached if the whole sample were in the normal state. In other words, this suggests strongly that a large fraction of the sample is still superconducting at 77 K and at 430 kG. Now, assuming that the upper critical field is given approximately9 by the parabolic equation

\[H_{c2}(T) = H_{c2}(0)[1-(T/T_{c})^{2}]\]

with

\[T_{c} \approx 93\;{\rm K},\]

we deduce that for these regions of the sample which stay superconducting at 77 K, 430 kG, we have \(H_{c2}(T)\) >= 430 kG and \(H_{c2}(0) = H_{c2}(77)/[1-(T/T_{c})^{2}] \geq 1200\) kG.

We now consider the 90-K magnetoresistance (Fig. 2) which shows clear tendency toward saturation with increasing field. However, here too the comparison of the curves \(\rho_{\perp}(T,200\) kG) and \(\rho_{\perp}(T,400\) kG) of Fig. 1 with the dashed lines of the same figure is interesting and suggests that superconducting effects (though very weak) still persist at high field. Let us assume that this is connected with some small regions of the sample and apply the same reasoning as for the 77-K isotherm. Then, from Eq. (1), we obtain the upper critical field which would be associated with these regions: \(H_{c2}(0) \geq 430\) kG/[1 - (90/93)2] \(\approx 7\) MG. Such a value is probably too high to have a plausible meaning. It might signify that the high field data near 90 K cannot be described by the same transition temperature (93 K) as at low \(H\).

Instead of taking \(T_{c} = 93\) K for the whole sample (as we have done before) and searching for \(H_{c2}\), we can tentatively assume that the superconducting effects remaining (90 K, 400 kG) have the same origin as the departure from linearity of \(\rho(T,0)\) for \(T \leq 110\) K. Then, putting \(T_{c}^{\prime} = 110\) K (instead of 93 K) in Eq. (1) leads to \(H_{c2}^{\prime}(0) \geq 1250\) kG. This result must be regarded with caution; nevertheless it is not inconsistent with the suggestion that superconductivity effects begin at temperatures as high as 110 K. More generally, this might either be due to chemical inhomogeneities, especially variations in oxygen composition, or to more intrinsic properties such as time-dependent critical phenomena.

Returning to Fig. 2, we see that the transverse magnetoresistance of the high-temperature phase is negative and roughly quadratic in \(H\). Moreover, its amplitude first increases with \(T\) [since \(\mid\Delta\rho(110\;{\rm K},H)\mid < \mid\Delta\rho(135\;{\rm K},\;H)\mid\)], and then evolves much more slowly with increasing

Figure 1: Temperature dependence of the electrical resistances in \(H\) = 0, and in transverse fields of 200 and 400 kG. It is to be stressed that \(H\) = 200- and 400-kG curves have not been measured at constant field, but have instead been deduced indirectly from the transverse magnetoresistance isotherms of Fig. 2. The dashed lines are linear extrapolations of the high-temperature resistances to low temperatures and have been traced for the purpose of comparison with the true resistances (full lines). The inset is an enlargement of the transition region showing that the resistance starts to drop toward zero value at \(\approx 110\) K.

  \(T\), as we see no detectable difference between \(\Delta\rho_{\perp}\)(135 K, \(H\)) and \(\Delta\rho_{\perp}\)(200 K, \(H\)). This is probably fortuitous and would mean that \(\Delta\rho_{\perp}\) passes through an extremum somewhere between 135 and 200 K. This is perhaps best illustrated in Fig. 3 showing \(\Delta\rho_{\perp}\)(\(T\),\(H\))/\(\rho\)(\(T\),0) at various \(T\). We tentatively propose that the above behavior is due to the contribution of at least three competing terms which we write as follows:

\[\Delta\rho=\Delta\rho^{s}+\Delta\rho^{m}+\Delta\rho^{n}\ .\] (3)

Here \(\Delta\rho^{s}\) is a positive term arising from the suppression of superconducting fluctuations by the applied field. \(\Delta\rho^{m}\) is a negative contribution whose origin is not clear to us: It could be due to some unusual mechanisms, typical of the new superconductors, such as localization effects or, more probably, to some coupling between the electromagnetic field and oxygen, leading to a rearrangement of the short-range order of oxygen ions. A more conventional possibility is that it is a magnetic effect. In this case, \(\Delta\rho^{m}\) would represent a spin-disorder resistivity of the sort observed either in usual ferromagnetic metals [10, 11] above the Curie temperature or in magnetic alloys such as spin glasses [12]. Interestingly enough, if the magnetoresistance is of magnetic origin, then the fact that it is strongly anisotropic with \(\Delta\rho_{\perp}\ll\Delta\rho_{\parallel}\) (Fig. 4) would imply a large orbital contribution comparable to the isotropic spin contribution. It is to be emphasized that the presence of orbital effects would have large influences on the behavior of many other physical quantities such as Hall resistivity, NMR, and EPR, etc.

Finally, the last term, \(\Delta\rho^{n}\) of the right-hand side of Eq. (3) is the Lorentz or (normal) magnetoresistance, the most characteristic feature of which is that it is always positive with \(\Delta\rho_{\perp}^{n}>\Delta\rho\). From Figs. 2 and 4, it is clear that as long as the transverse geometry is concerned, the Lorentz magnetoresistance is completely masked by the negative contribution, whereas it is predominant in the longitudinal configuration (Fig. 4). It is worth noting that very peculiar transport data showing magnetothermal irreversibilities, time-dependent effects, and other unusual phenomena at high temperature between 80 and 300 K have been reported recently [13]. No effects of that sort have been detected by us. The reason might be that transport properties are very sensitive to all kinds of inhomogeneities on a microscopic scale and could therefore differ markedly from sample to sample depending on the method of preparation employed.

Our high field data confirm that YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) behaves like an inhomogeneous material, the superconducting properties of which are at the present time primarily limited by the badly superconducting parts (weak links) of the sample. It is likely that with the inevitable improvement of the methods of preparation of these materials the critical field \(H_{c2}\)(77 K) will attain several hundreds of kG.
