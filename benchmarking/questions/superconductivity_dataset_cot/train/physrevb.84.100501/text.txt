###### Abstract

The interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in LaFeAsO\({}_{0.945}\)F\({}_{0.055}\) was studied as a function of hydrostatic pressure up to \(p\simeq 2.4\) GPa by means of muon-spin rotation (\(\mu\)SR) and magnetization measurements. The application of pressure leads to a substantial decrease of the magnetic ordering temperature, reduction of the magnetic phase volume and, at the same time, to a strong increase of the superconducting transition temperature and the diamagnetic susceptibility. From the volume-sensitive \(\mu\)SR measurements it can be concluded that the superconducting and the magnetic areas, coexisting in the same sample, are inclined toward spatial separation and compete for phase volume as a function of pressure.

pacs: DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.84.100501 100501-1 10  The results of the magnetization studies are presented in Fig. 1. At ambient pressure the diamagnetic susceptibility at \(T\simeq 3.5\) K [\(\chi\)(3.5 K)] reaches \(\sim\)1% of its ideal value (\(\chi_{\rm id}=-1/4\pi\)). This suggests that the superconductivity at \(p=0.0\) is just filamentary and is present only within a small volume of the sample. With increasing pressure, both the onset temperature of the superconducting transition \(T_{c}\) [determined from the intersect of the linearly extrapolated \(\chi(T)\) in the vicinity of \(T_{c}\) with the zero line--see Fig. 1] and the low-temperature value of the diamagnetic response (\(-4\pi\,\chi\)) increase quite substantially. According to Fig. 1, the increase of the external pressure from \(p=0.0\) to \(2.02\) GPa leads to the shift of \(T_{c}\) from \(\simeq\)7 to \(\simeq\)16 K and to an increase of \(-4\pi\,\chi\) from \(\sim\)1% to \(\sim\)35%. An additional set of dc magnetization measurements at \(p\simeq 1.1\) GPa show that the diamagnetic response reduces by a factor of 2 for an applied field of 1 mT in ZFC and to a value of \(4\pi\,\chi\simeq-0.05\) in \(\mu_{0}H=5\) mT FC experiments, respectively (both are not shown). Such differences, which could be caused by the effect of pinning and the presence of weak links between the superconducting areas, do not permit a reliable evaluation of the genuine superconducting volume. One may only conclude that the superconducting volume fraction increases with increasing pressure but is always smaller than the whole sample volume.

The magnetic properties of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.94}\)F\({}_{0.05}\) were studied in zero-field (ZF) muon-spin rotation experiments. Pressures up to \(\simeq\)2.4 GPa were generated in a double-wall piston-cylinder MP35N cell. Few representative muon-time spectra measured at \(p=0.0\) and 2.36 GPa are shown in the insets of Fig. 2. The data were analyzed by decomposing the signal on the contribution of the sample and the pressure cell as

\[A(t)=A_{\rm S}(0)\ P_{\rm S}(t)+A_{\rm FC}(0)\ P_{\rm FC}(t).\] (1)

Here \(A_{\rm S}(0)\) and \(A_{\rm FC}(0)\) are the initial asymmetries and \(P_{\rm S}(t)\) and \(P_{\rm FC}(t)\) are the muon-spin polarizations belonging to the sample and the pressure cell, respectively. \(P_{\rm FC}(t)\) was measured in an independent experiment. The response of the sample was assumed to consist of a magnetic and a nonmagnetic contribution and is described as

\[P_{\rm S}(t)=\omega\big{[}\frac{1}{s}\ e^{-\Lambda_{m,t}t}+\frac{2}{3}[\xi\ e^{- \Lambda_{m,t}t}+(1-\zeta)e^{-\Lambda_{m,t}t}]\big{]}\]

\[+(1-\omega)e^{-\Lambda_{m,t}t}.\]

Here \(\omega\) is the relative weight (volume) of the magnetic fraction. \(\Lambda_{m,t}\), \(\Lambda_{m,t}\), and \(\Lambda_{m,t}\) are the exponential depolarization rates representing the longitudinal (\(1/3\)) and the transversal (\(2/3\)) relaxing components within the parts of the sample being in the magnetic state. The two components within the curly brackets account for contributions of two different muon stopping sites with the relative weights \(\xi\) and (\(1-\zeta\)), respectively. As follows from Ref. [13], one site is located on the line connecting the La and As ions along the \(c\) direction, while the second one is located near the oxygen ions. \(\Lambda_{pm}\) is the relaxation within the parts of the sample remaining nonmagnetic. The exponential character of this relaxation, instead of the normally expected Kubo-Toyabe kind of behavior,[14] is probably caused by the presence of the small amount of magnetic impurities, similar to the one observed in the so called "11" family of Fe-based HTS (see, e.g., Refs. [4] and [15]). For each particular pressure the whole set of the data was fitted simultaneously with \(A_{\rm S}(0)\), \(A_{\rm FC}(0)\), \(\zeta\), and the ratio \(\Lambda_{m,t}/\Lambda_{m,t}2\) as common and \(\omega\), \(\Lambda_{m,t}\), \(\Lambda_{m,t}\), and \(\Lambda_{m,t}\) as individual parameters for each temperature point. The solid lines in the insets of Fig. 2 represent the result of the fit. The contribution from the cell at \(T=5\) K is shown as a dotted line.

The main panel of Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the magnetic fraction \(\omega\) on temperature for \(p=0.0,0.5,1.16\), and

The magnetic ordering temperature \(T_{\rm S}\) is defined as the temperature where the magnetic fraction reaches 50% of its maximum low-temperature value. The insets show the ZF muon-time spectra at \(p=0.0\) and 2.36 GPa. The solid lines are fits by means of Eq. (1). The dotted lines represent the response of the pressure cell.

  2.36 GPa. Two important points needs to be considered. First, the magnetic volume fraction at each particular temperature is lowered by the application of pressure. Most noteworthy, with increasing pressure an increasingly large part of the sample remains in the paramagnetic state down to the lowest temperatures. Second, the magnetic ordering temperature \(T_{\rm N}\), defined as the temperature where the magnetic fraction reaches 50% of its maximum low-temperature value, initially decreases with increasing pressure but then demonstrates a tendency to saturate. \(\omega(T)\) curves at \(p=1.16\), 1.92 (not shown), and 2.36 GPa being normalized to their values at \(T\simeq 5\) K become almost identical.

In order to compare the influence of the pressure on the superconducting and the magnetic properties of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.948}\)F\({}_{0.055}\), the dependences of \(T_{\rm N}\), \(T_{\rm c}\), \(\omega\), and \(4\pi\,\chi\) as a function of \(p\) are plotted in Fig. 3. The decrease of \(T_{\rm N}\) and \(\omega\) is associated with the corresponding increase of \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(4\pi\,\chi\). By applying a pressure of 2.36 GPa, \(T_{\rm N}\) decreases from 44 to 27 K, while \(T_{\rm c}\) more than doubles from \(\simeq\)7 to \(\simeq\)16 K upon the application of 2.02 GPa.

It should be noted here that the above presented data are pointing to a competition of superconductivity and magnetism, but alone do not allow to answer the question on how these two forms of order coexist within the LaFeAsO\({}_{0.945}\)F\({}_{0.055}\) sample. There are three possible scenarios. The first one is the so-called _phase separation_ scenario according to which the superconductivity develops just within the parts of the sample remaining nonmagnetic down to low temperatures. Such a phase-separated coexistence was observed, e.g., in Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\).[7, 16] The second possibility is an _atomic_ coexistence of the superconducting and magnetic order parameters, which is consistent with models proposed in Ref. [17] and most probably realized within the so-called "11" family of Fe-based HTSs.[4, 18] The third possibility is a _nanoscale_ segregation into magnetic domains, similar to that reported for cuprate HTSs.[2, 19] In underdoped cuprate HTSs, static, short-range, stripelike magnetic correlations are thought to exist in the superconducting state and are assumed not to affect the superconducting carriers.[2] Muons are sensitive to dipolar fields at a distance of up to a few lattice spacings, so if nanoscale magnetic domains exist, then the fraction of muons experiencing static local magnetic fields could be significantly higher than the fraction of Fe sites carrying an ordered moment. Such a type of coexistence was found to be realized within the SmFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) and CeFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) families of Fe-based HTSs.[3, 9]

Since the muon is a local probe, the \(\mu\)SR signals from spatially different areas of the sample are not averaged but superimposed in the measured spectra. This feature allows to distinguish between the three above-mentioned scenarios. As discussed above, the ZF-\(\mu\)SR response of the magnetic areas of the sample is characterized by a fast relaxing signal visible at early times of the spectra, while a nonmagnetic volume shows slow relaxation, better visible at longer times, only. In Fig. 4 two ZF muon-time spectra taken at the same temperature (\(T=2.6\) K) and pressure (\(p=2.36\) GPa) with different magnetic histories are shown. The first muon-time spectrum was recorded after cooling the sample from \(T\simeq 100\) to 2.6 K in zero magnetic field. By keeping the temperature constant, the second ZF spectrum was obtained after ramping the magnetic field up to \(\mu_{0}H\simeq 0.1\) T and then setting it back

(b) and (c) show the extended parts of the muon-time spectra at the lower and the higher time, respectively. The solid lines are fits by means of Eq. (1).

  to zero. Apparently, the ZF-\(\mu\)SR response of the magnetic areas of the sample, as evidenced by the identically fast relaxations \(\Lambda_{m,t1}\) and \(\Lambda_{m,t2}\) at early times of the spectrum [see Fig. 4(b) and Table 1], is not affected by the magnetic history. On the contrary, the ZF-\(\mu\)SR signal representing the nonmagnetic volume of the sample exhibits a strongly larger relaxation \(\Lambda_{\rho\mu}\) after the application of an external field at low temperatures [see Fig. 4(c) and Table 1]. This indicates that the superconductivity is most probably located within the nonmagnetic areas of the sample, since any changes of the magnetic field within a superconductor with nonzero pinning leads to trapping the magnetic flux and, as a consequence, to a very nonuniform field distribution inside the superconducting parts of the sample.[20]

Our results point to a strong difference between LaFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) and the structurally related families of Fe-based HTSs with the La atom substituted by other rare-earth elements such as Sm, Ce, Pr, Nd, etc. In these families bulk magnetism and bulk superconductivity are found to coexist on the nanoscale level.[39] The magnetization and \(\mu\)SR experiments reveal that in LaFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\), the magnetism and superconductivity are not coexisting over the whole sample volume, i.e., this system is inclined toward phase separation. The reduction of the magnetic interaction and the simultaneous appearance of superconductivity indicate a much stronger competition between the two ordered parameters.

In conclusion, the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity was studied in LaFeAsO\({}_{0.945}\)F\({}_{0.055}\) by performing muon-spin rotation and magnetization experiments as a function of pressure up to \(p\simeq 2.4\) GPa. At ambient pressure the sample is purely magnetic, but at the border to the superconducting state of LaFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\). The application of hydrostatic pressure leads to a substantial decrease of \(T_{\rm N}\) and a reduction of the magnetic phase volume and, at the same time, to a strong increase of \(T_{c}\) and the diamagnetic susceptibility. Magnetic-history-dependent ZF-\(\mu\)SR measurements show that superconductivity most probably develops in the areas of the sample that are nonmagnetic down to the lowest temperatures. This shows that in LaFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) magnetism and superconductivity are competing order parameters.
