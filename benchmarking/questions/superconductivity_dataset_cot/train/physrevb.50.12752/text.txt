###### Abstract

Pressure effects on the tetragonal infinite-layer structure were studied in superconducting Sr0.1A0.1CuO2 (electron-doped) and Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2 (hole-doped) samples, and in an insulating nonsuperconducting Sr0.1A0.8Ca0.8CuO2 sample, using time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction. Neutron-diffraction measurements, with the sample at room temperature, were performed at several hydrostatic pressures up to =0.6 GPa on each of the three samples, using a helium-gas pressure cell. The measured compressibilities, which are similar for the three samples, show a large anisotropy, and are in a good agreement with first-principles calculations performed for undoped Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2. Atomic size effects of the \(A\) atom in _A_CuO2 on the crystal lattice are discussed and are compared with the pressure effects. A relation is found between the in-plane compressibilities among _n_-layer (_n_ = 1,2,3 ..., ) structures of high-_T__c_ superconductors.

## I Introduction

The effect of pressure on \(T_{c}\) and its relation to pressure-induced crystallographic changes in high-_T__c_ superconductors (HTSC's) have been the subject of numerous studies.[1] It is believed that one way pressure affects \(T_{c}\) is via its effect on carrier concentration. There are, however, in addition, intrinsic structural contributions to the pressure effect on \(T_{c}\), which arise from the effect of pressure on the Cu-O bond length (interplane) and intraplane separation at a constant carrier concentration.[1; 2] In hole-doped HTSC it is generally found that the pressure derivative of \(T_{c}\), _dT__c_/_dP_, is positive.[1] The remarkable pressure-induced increase in \(T_{c}\) in HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8 (Hg-1223) from 134 K (ambient) to 153 K (15 GPa),[3] and to 164 K (30 GPa) (Ref. [4]) generated renewed interest in pressure effects on HTCS's. These papers were immediately followed by a study[5] of pressure-induced crystallographic changes in Hg-1201, Hg-1212, and Hg-1223. In this study, compressibilities of four bond lengths, two within and two between the conducting blocks of CuO2 layers are reported. The difficult question of the relation between these four bond compressibilities and the pressure derivative of \(T_{c}\) was addressed in this paper. It is intuitively clear that as the number of CuO2 planes per conducting block \(n\) increases, the effect of the bonds external to the conducting block on _dT__c_/_dP_ should decrease. At the extreme, when \(n\) is very large, one obtains the simplest structure among all HTSC's, the infinite-layer (IL) structure (Fig. 1).[6] This structure has only two bond lengths, and the problem of relating bond length changes to changes in \(T_{c}\) is considerably simplified.

The first cuprate synthesized in the infinite layer (IL) structure was Sr0.1A0.8Ca0.8CuO2,[6] which was found to be antiferromagnetic and not superconducting. It was possible to stabilize the IL structure at ambient oxygen pressure only in a narrow range near this composition.[7] Other compositions of Sr1-_M_xCuO2 with \(M\) = Ba,[8; 9] Ca,7-10 Pr,[11] Nd,11-13 La,13-15 Sm,[13] and Gd (Ref. [13]) were stabilized in the IL structure using synthesis under high oxygen pressure and high temperature. Superconductivity was found in all of these compositions with \(T_{c}\) = 80 - 110 K for Ba, Ca, and \(T_{c}\) \(\approx\) 40 K for Nd, La, Sm, and Gd. The \(M\) = lanthanide samples are electron doped,

 are nearly phase pure and generally give large superconducting fractions.[12]\({}^{-}\)[15] The superconducting Ba and Ca samples are invariably phase impure, contain planar defects,[9]\({}^{,}\)[10]\({}^{,}\)[16] and give small superconducting fractions (SF < 20%).[9]\({}^{,}\)[10] It is speculated that in the \(M\) = Ba, Ca compounds, hole doping is caused by planar defects and/or _A_-site vacancies and/or oxygen non-stoichiometry.[9]\({}^{,}\)[10]\({}^{,}\)[16]\({}^{,}\)[17]

Studies of the pressure effect on _T_c show that _dT_c/_dP_  0.0, 0.6, 0.7, and 2.1 K/GPa in Sr0.92Sm0.08CuO2,[18] Sr0.86Nd0.14CuO2,[12] Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2,[18] and SrCuO2.[18] This result is consistent with what was found in many cuprate superconductors, namely, the pressure derivative of _T_c for hole-doped compounds is generally larger than the derivative for electron-doped compounds.[1]

In the present paper we report the results of a neutron-diffraction study of the effect of pressure on the lattice constants of three compounds with the IL structure: an electron-doped superconductor, Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 with _T_c = 42 K and SF \(\approx\) 70%;[15] a hole-doped superconductor, Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2 with _T_c = 99 K and SF \(\approx\) 4%; and a nonsuperconducting sample, Sr0.14Ca0.86CuO2. The compressibilities obtained for these samples are compared with the results of first principles calculations[19] and with empirical predictions[20] for the IL structure. The Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2 sample contained orthorhombic[21] Sr4Cu6O10 as a second phase, for which the compressibilities are also reported.

## II Preparation and Characterization of the Samples

The Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 sample was prepared using high-pressure (5 GPa) and high-temperature (950 degC) synthesis. The details of the preparation were published previously.[15] The sample was a disk approximately 2 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick with a mass of 82 mg. Magnetic (ac) susceptibility measurements for this sample show[15] a well-defined superconducting transition at 42 K and a large diamagnetic signal (corresponding to a superconducting fraction of 70%) consistent with bulk superconductivity. The same sample was used in a previous neutron-diffraction study of the structure of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2.[15]

The Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2 sample was obtained from starting materials which consisted of preformed low-pressure (orthorhombic) phases[22] of (Sr0.7Ca0.3)CuO2 and (Sr0.7Ca0.3)2CuO3, which were mixed in molar ratio of 9:1. This ratio corresponds to a nominal composition of (Sr0.7Ca0.3)1.1CuO2, which is inconsistent with the IL structure and will lead to the formation of a second phase (_wide infra_), unless defects are formed in large concentrations. The low-pressure phases were synthesized from high purity (99.995%) SrCO3, CaCO3, and CuO, which were mixed in agate mortar and pestle for 1 h, and prereacted at 950 degC for 15 h. The whole procedure was repeated five times. After phase-pure compounds were confirmed by x-ray diffraction, the appropriate proportions of the low-pressure phases were mixed and pressed at 800 Kg/cm2. The pressed pellets (3 g), were loaded into a gold capsule, sandwiched between two pellets (0.3 g) of KClO4. The thoroughly sealed capsule was loaded into an opposed anvil press and pressed at 5.7 GPa at 1050 degC for 1 h. An internal oxidizing atmosphere was produced in the capsule at high temperature by decomposition of KClO4. At the end of 1 h, the sample was quenched to room temperature before releasing the pressure.

Small specimens taken from the sample were used for x-ray diffraction, electrical resistance, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Specimens taken from the surface of the sample showed _T_c is as high as 105 K and diamagnetic signals corresponding to superconducting fractions as high as 20%. The relatively large specimen of 0.56 g for neutron diffraction was taken from the core of the sample. Magnetic (ac) susceptibility measurements of a specimen from the neutron-diffraction sample show a well-defined superconducting transition at 99 K with a diamagnetic signal corresponding to a superconducting fraction of 4%. X-ray diffraction showed lines which do not belong to the IL structure and were identified as contributions from Sr4Cu6O10 impurity.[21] Two-phase analysis of the neutron-diffraction data yielded (_vide infra_) a volume fraction of \(\approx\) 15% for this phase. The nonsuperconducting phases of Sr\({}_{n-1}\)Cu\({}_{n+1}\)O\({}_{2n}\) form in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere,[17]\({}^{,}\)[21] whereas superconducting phases of Sr\({}_{n+1}\)Cu\({}_{n}\)O\({}_{2n+1}\) form in oxygen-rich atmosphere[22]\({}^{,}\)[23] during the high-pressure synthesis. These superconducting phases were found in small specimens taken from the surface of the sample and were not found in the specimen taken from the core of the sample for neutron diffraction. Formation of Sr4Cu6O10 therefore suggests oxygen deficiency at the core of the sample during the high-pressure synthesis.

The Sr0.14Ca0.86CuO2 sample was synthesized by intimately mixing SrCO3, CaCO3, and CuO (all 999.99%) in the proportions 0.14:0.86:1. The mixture was fired in air

## III High-pressure neutron-diffraction measurements and analysis

A He-gas pressure cell (described previously[24]) was used to control the pressure on the sample in the neutron beam. In order to minimize neutron background, the two small samples (Sr\({}_{0.9}\)La\({}_{0.1}\)CuO\({}_{2}\) and Sr\({}_{0.7}\)Ca\({}_{0.3}\)CuO\({}_{2}\), Table I) were supported in the neutron beam inside the pressure cell by a boron-coated tungsten fiber. The He-gas pressure cell offers the advantage of hydrostatic conditions, precise pressure measurements, and (owing to the fixed-angle time-of-flight technique) diffraction data that are completely free from Bragg scattering from the cell. For each sample, neutron-diffraction data were taken at room temperature at several pressures (including ambient pressure, Table I) on the Special Environment Powder Diffractometer at the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS).[25] The data were taken at the two 90 deg detector banks. Total data collecting times were about 35, 55, and 4 h for the Sr\({}_{0.9}\)La\({}_{0.1}\)CuO\({}_{2}\), Sr\({}_{0.7}\)Ca\({}_{0.3}\)CuO\({}_{2}\), Sr\({}_{0.14}\)Ca\({}_{0.86}\)CuO\({}_{2}\) samples, respectively.

The IPNS program for Rietveld analysis of the time-of-flight neutron-diffraction data[26] was used to analyze the pattern taken at each pressure. In this analysis the structural parameters of the sample are refined so that the calculated pattern will best fit (least squares) the observed pattern. The analyses were performed using the

  space group \(P\)4/_mmm_ (Ref. [27]) for the infinite layer structure. A two-phase analysis was used for the Sr0.7Ca0.5CuO2 sample, which contained Sr4Cu6O10 as a second phase. Using the space group _Cmmm_ (Refs. [21] and [27]) for the second phase, the analysis yielded a volume fraction of about 15% of Sr4Cu6O10 in this sample. The thermal factors of all the atoms and the linewidth were allowed to vary in the analysis and were found to be independent (within the experimental uncertainty) of pressure. A summary of the results for the three samples at ambient pressure is given in Table 2. Observed and calculated profiles for the three samples are shown in Fig. 2.

## IV Results and discussion

The ambient pressure lattice constants as determined in the present work (Table 2) for the three samples are in good agreement with values from the literature [6, 8, 10, 14, 29, 30] (Fig. 3). This agreement corroborates the nominal composition of the samples. The pressure-induced changes in the lattice constants and in the unit-cell volume are shown in Figs. 4-7 for Sr0.9La0.1CuO2, Sr0.7Ca0.5CuO2, Sr0.14Ca0.8CuO2, and Sr4Cu6O10, respectively. The observed compressibilities which were obtained from linear fits to these changes are given in Table 3. The compressibilities of the four cuprates are similar and have large compressibility anisotropy. The structure of Sr4Cu6O10 is similar to the IL structure, which may explain the similarity in the compressibilities [it consists of Cu-deficient CuO2 layers (containing CuO double chains) separated by a layer of Sr (Ref. [21])].

The large compressibility anisotropy (_k__a_/_k__c_  0.5) observed in the present work is in a good agreement with the prediction (_k__a_/_k__c_  0.48) of a recent calculation of the compressibilities in the IL structure using first-principles total energy calculations.[19] These calculations which are based on the lattice parameters reported[10] for Sr0.7Ca0.5CuO2 predict \(k_{a}\),_k__c_,\(k_{v}\)  2 x 10-3, 4.23 x 10-3, 8.22 x 10-3 (GPa-1), in excellent agreement with the measured values of 2.2(1) x 10-3, 4.07(9) x 10-3, 8.5(3) x 10-3 (GPa-1) for Sr0.7Ca0.5CuO2 (Table 3).

  This agreement with the calculations (in which crystal lattices are refined to give minimum electronic energies) suggests that the compressibilities are largely determined by the electronic structure.

The measured compressibilities of Sr\({}_{0.9}\)La\({}_{0.1}\)CuO\({}_{2}\), Sr\({}_{0.7}\)Ca\({}_{0.3}\)CuO\({}_{2}\), and Sr\({}_{0.14}\)Ca\({}_{0.86}\)CuO\({}_{2}\) are compared in Table 4 to the results of empirical calculations which use the concept of comparative crystal chemistry.[20] There is general qualitative agreement, however, the calculated \(\kappa_{c}\) and \(\kappa\) values are systematically higher than the measured values. We have no explanation for this systematic discrepancy. It is interesting to point out that Sr\({}_{0.9}\)La\({}_{0.1}\)CuO\({}_{2}\) (electron doped) and Sr\({}_{0.7}\)Ca\({}_{0.3}\)CuO\({}_{2}\) (hole doped) have the same compressibilities. This is consistent with recent measurements[31] of the compressibilities of Nd\({}_{1.835}\)Ce\({}_{0.165}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (electron doped) which are found to be essentially the same as hole-doped superconductors with the same structure.[1]

The increase of \(T_{c}\) with pressure in Sr\({}_{0.7}\)Ca\({}_{0.3}\)CuO\({}_{2}\) and SrCuO\({}_{2}\) (Ref. [18]) suggests that \(T_{c}\) can be increased at ambient pressure if the system is suitably modified.[1] Figure 3 shows how the lattice parameters are modified by changing the size (\(M\!=\!\)Ca) and the size and charge (\(M\!=\!\)La) of the \(A\) atom in \(A\)CuO\({}_{2}\). It is interesting to compare the pressure effect with this size effect on the crystal lattice. The response of the lattice parameters to changing the size and charge of the \(A\) atom in \(A\)CuO\({}_{2}\) is illustrated in Fig. 8. As Sr\({}^{2+}\) (\(r_{\rm eff}\!\approx\!1.26\) A) is replaced by the smaller Ca\({}^{2+}\) the two lattice parameters decrease linearly with \(r_{\rm eff}\), suggesting a pure size effect. When Sr\({}^{2+}\) is replaced by the smaller La\({}^{3+}\) or Nd\({}^{3+}\) ions, electron doping of the Cu-O bond causes it to expand resulting in an increase in \(a\). The variation of \(c\) with \(r_{\rm eff}\) fits a single straight line for Ca\({}^{2+}\), La\({}^{3+}\), and Nd\({}^{3+}\) and is in

[11]) vs the effective radius, \(r_{\rm eff}\), where \(r_{\rm eff}\!=\!(1\!-\!x)r_{\rm fit}+xr_{M}\). The following ionic radii with eightfold coordination were used (Ref. [32]): \(r_{\rm fit}\!=\!1.26\), \(r_{\rm Ca}\!=\!1.12\), \(r_{\rm La}\!=\!1.160\), and \(r_{\rm Nd}\!=\!1.109\) (Å). Results from the literature are represented by open symbols. Closed symbols represent results of the present work.

  dependent of doping, consistent with a pure size effect. The response of \(a\) and \(c\) to the size of \(A\) can be characterized by the respective derivatives: _da_/_dr_eff and _dc_/_dr_eff which equal 0.528 and 1.896, respectively. This can be compared with the respective pressure derivatives _da_/_dp_ and _dc_/_dp_ which are equal to 0.008 59 and 0.013 61 (A/GPa), respectively. This result shows that the size anisotropy (i.e., _dc_/_da_) is equal to 3.6, compared to a pressure anisotropy of 1.6.

The \(a\) vs _r_eff line represents data of essentially undoped nonsuperconducting samples.8 The \(a\) value for the superconducting (SF = 4%) Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2 sample of the present work (closed circle at _r_eff = 1.22 A in Fig. 8) concurs with this line, hence, showing no doping of the Cu-O bond (within the experimental accuracy). There are three possible explanations to this result: (i) If only 4% ( = SF) of the IL structure is doped, the bulk of the sample (i.e., 96%) does not show a lattice change, and the lattice change of the small (i.e., 4%) portion of the sample is not detected by the present neutron-diffraction analysis. (ii) The phase with the IL structure is not the superconducting phase, or (iii) as previously suggest,10,16 superconductivity is associated with planar defects. None of these possibilities can be ruled out using the data of the present work.

In the IL structure, the compressibility \(k_{a}\) is essentially the compressibility of the CuO2 layer. In other HTSC's, there are other layers which affect the in-plane compressibility. However, the CuO2 layer is the most densely packed among these layers and is therefore expected to be the major contributor to the in-plane compressibility, \(k_{a}\). Hence, the in-plane compressibility will decrease as the linear density of these planes, _n_/_c_ (i.e., number of planes per unit length along _c_), increases. Consider, for example, the series of structures Hg-1 2 \(n\) - 1 \(n\) (_n_ = 1,2,3, ...),5 The linear density, _n_/_c_, increases monotonically with \(n\), reaching a maximum value at \(n\) = . . for the infinite layer structure). The in-plane compressibility, \(k_{a}\), is therefore expected to decrease monotonically with \(n\) and reach a minimum value at \(n\) = . This behavior is clearly delineated in Fig. 9, consistent with the hypothesis that the major contribution to \(k_{a}\) comes from the CuO2 layers.

## V Conclusions

The compressibilities of three compositions in the IL structure Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2, Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2, Sr0.14Ca0.8CuO2, superconducting electron doped, hole doped, and nonsuperconducting were measured and were found to be highly anisotropic and essentially independent of composition. The measured values are in a good agreement with first-principles calculation performed for undoped Sr0.7Ca0.3CuO2. The response of the crystal lattice to an increase of the atomic size of \(A\) in _A_CuO2, is highly anisotropic, with the \(c\) axis 3.6 times softer than the \(a\) axis. The compressibility of the CuO2 lattice governs the in-plane compressibility in _n_-layered ( \(n\) = 1,2,3..., ) cuprates. Consequently, \(k_{a}\) increases as the inverse of the linear density of the CuO2 planes, _n_/_c_.
