###### Abstract

We report on the superconducting properties of noncentrosymmetric superconductor LaPtGe, which crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric \alpha-ThSi_{2} structure. The magnetization, resistivity, and specific-heat measurements confirm that LaPtGe is a type-II bulk superconductor with a transition temperature T_{c}=3.05\pm 0.05 K. Muon-spin relaxation/rotation measurements suggest that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting ground state.

## I Introduction

In recent years, several new superconducting materials have been discovered. Many of these new superconductors are described as "unconventional," as their superconducting properties deviate from traditional BCS theory [1]. Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) have emerged as an exciting class of new unconventional superconductors. The lack of inversion symmetry can make the pairing scenario different, which introduces the possibility of a vast array of exotic physics [2, 3, 4, 5]. A nontrivial antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) that arises due to an asymmetric electric-field gradient lifts the original conduction electron spin degeneracy at the Fermi level, splitting it into two sublevels [6]. This leads to an admix superconducting ground state that exhibits many exotic properties that have not been observed in conventional superconductors [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The admixed pairing state can be manipulated by tuning the ASOC, which directly controls the mixing ratio of the singlet/triplet pairing channel [16]. In addition, the importance of electronic correlations, which often facilitate the interaction between different pairing channels, cannot be neglected. Strongly correlated superconductors without inversion symmetry include CePtSi [17], Re_{6} (Zr,Hf,Ti) [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], and Ulr [24], while LaNiC_{2}[25], Li_{2}M_{3}B (M= Pd, Pt) [16, 26], and La_{7}Ir_{3}[27] are weakly correlated. Weakly correlated materials are of great importance since the effects of broken inversion symmetry and asymmetric spin-orbit coupling interactions can be more explicitly separated and understood.

At present, the major issue in this area is how the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling influences the parity mixing in these materials and the presence/absence of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). Until now, only a small number of superconductors have been discovered that exhibit TRSB [18, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32], which makes it difficult to determine the roles of asymmetric spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations in noncentrosymmetric superconductors. Therefore, it is crucial to search for new superconductors whose crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry.

In this paper, we report on a comprehensive study of the superconducting properties of the noncentrosymmetric ternary equiatomic compound LaPtGe, which is a ternary variant of \alpha-ThSi_{2} structure in which a three-dimensional network of three connected metalloid atoms is found with tetragonal symmetry [33]. Theoretical calculations on the ternary variant of the \alpha-ThSi_{2} compounds show strong spin-orbital coupling strength [34]. The calculation of Kneidinger _et al._ on the parent ternary compound LaPtSi revealed strong ASOC [35]. It is interesting to look for more compounds in the same family to find the effect of ASOC on the superconducting ground state, in particular LaPtGe in the present case. Here we have used resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity along with muon-spin spectroscopy to probe the gap symmetry and nature of the superconducting ground state.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline LaPtGe samples were prepared using a standard arc-melting technique. High-purity La (99.99%), Pt (99.99%), and Ge (99.99%) were taken in a stoichiometric ratio and melted in a water-cooled copper hearth under high-purity argon gas. The resulting ingot formed with the negligible mass loss was flipped and remelted several times to improve the homogeneity. The phase purity and crystal structure of the sample were confirmed by room-temperature x-ray diffraction measurement using a PANalytical diffractometer equipped with Cu K\alpha radiation (\lambda=1.5406 A). Magnetization measurements were done using a superconducting quantum interference device (MPMS 3, Quantum Design). The electrical resistivity and heat-capacity measurements of the sample were performed using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design). The \muSR experiments were carried out using a 100% spin-polarized pulse muon beam at ISIS facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, United Kingdom.

## III Results and discussion

### Sample characterization

The x-ray diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. 1. Rietveld refinement to the data was done using fullprof software, which shows that the sample crystallizes into a tetragonal, noncentrosymmetric structure (space group I4_i_md) with derived lattice parameters a=b=4.2655(2) A, c=14.9654(1) A. The lattice parameters obtained in this work are in good agreement with data reported previously [33]. A small impurity peak is observed around 40^{\circ} (denoted by an asterisk) due to Pt_{3}Ge. Any significant effect of this impurity phase is not observed in bulk and muon spectroscopy measurements. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the crystal structure of LaPtGe.

### Normal and superconducting state properties

#### 1. Electrical resistivity

The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) of LaPtGe in the temperature range 1.8-300 K in zero applied magnetic field is shown in Fig. 2. A characteristic drop in resistivity, observed at T_{C}=3.05\pm 0.03 K, is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The residual resistivity ratio is comparable to other LaNiSi structure compounds [35]. A high value of absolute resistivity with the saturation behavior at high temperatures indicates that the data can well be described by the parallel-resistor model [36]. The saturation at high temperatures typically happens when the apparent mean free path becomes short, of the order of a few interatomic spacings [37, 38]. In such a scenario, the scattering cross section will not be linear in scattering perturbation. At high temperatures, the dominant temperature-dependent scattering mechanism is the electron-phonon interaction. So the resistivity will not be proportional to the mean-square atomic displacement, which is proportional to T for the harmonic potential. Instead, it will rise less rapidly with T showing a saturating behavior. In general, the electrical resistivity of a metal, for T>T_{C}, can be written as [36, 39]

\[\rho_{i}(T)=\rho_{i,0}+\rho_{i,L}(T).\] (1)

In this relation, the temperature-independent residual resistivity, which arises from impurities and disorder, is denoted by \rho_{i,0}, while the second term adds the temperature-dependent general resistivity, which can be written according to the generalized Bloch-Gruneisen expression [40]

\[\rho_{i,L}(T)=C\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}/T} \frac{x^{5}}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-1})}dx,\] (2)

where \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature obtained from resistivity measurements, while C is a material-dependent prefactor. In the case of saturation resistivity, the resistivity curve, considering the saturation at high temperature can be explained by

\[\rho(T)=\left[\frac{1}{\rho_{s}}+\frac{1}{\rho_{i}(T)}\right]^{-1},\] (3)

where \rho_{s} is the temperature-independent saturation value of resistivity, which will be attained at high temperatures.

A fit employing this model is shown in Fig. 2, and it yields a Debye temperature \Theta_{D}=139\pm 3 K, C=936\pm 7\mu\Omega cm, residual resistivity \rho_{i,0}=253\pm 2\mu\Omega cm, \rho_{s}=848\pm 4\mu\Omega cm. The values of the fit parameters are similar to those obtained for other intermetallic samples [39].

#### 2. Magnetization

Figure 3(a) shows the dc susceptibility data taken in an applied field of 2 mT in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled-cooling (FCC) modes. Superconductivity defined as the onset of the diamagnetization signal appears at T_{c}^{\text{onset}}=3.05\pm 0.05 K. The Meissner fraction value exceeds 100% due to the uncorrected geometrical demagnetization factor. The temperature-independent paramagnetic behavior for T>T_{C} suggests the absence of any magnetic impurities in the sample. The low-field magnetization measurement as a function of applied magnetic field (0-10 mT) is taken at different temperatures to calculate the lower critical field H_{C1} [see the inset in Fig. 3(b)]. The first deviation from linearity from the initial slope is taken as the basis to determine H_{C1} for all the respective temperatures. Figure 3(b) depicts the resulting temperature dependence of H_{C1}, which is fitted by

Figure 2: Temperature dependence of resistivity in the range 1.8\leqslant T\leqslant 300 K. The inset shows the drop in resistivity at the superconducting transition, T_{C}=3.05\pm 0.03 K. The normal-state resistivity is fitted with the parallel-resistor model in the temperature range 5\leqslant T\leqslant 300 K.

  the Ginzburg-Landau equation

\[H_{C1}(T)=H_{C1}(0)\Bigg{[}1-\left(\frac{T}{T_{C}}\right)^{2}\Bigg{]}.\] (4)

The value of H_{C1}(0) was estimated to be 2.1\pm 0.2 mT after fitting Eq. (4) in the H_{C1}(T) plot. Figure 3(c) presents the high-field magnetization loop collected at 1.95 K in the magnetic-field range \pm 2 T. The magnetic behavior exhibits conventional type-II superconductivity with an irreversible nature of magnetization below H_{\mathrm{nr}}=0.18 mT, above which point the applied field becomes strong enough to depin the vortices.

To measure the upper critical field as a function of temperature, H_{C2}(T), the shift in T_{C} in different applied magnetic fields was determined from magnetization and resistivity data. Resistivity measurement as a function of temperature, \rho(T), was performed at different applied magnetic fields up to 0.36 T (see the inset of Fig. 4). Figure 4 displays the linear variation of H_{C2}(T) when plotted against the reduced temperature t=T/T_{C}. Both resistivity and magnetization are in good agreement with the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) relation,

\[H_{C2}(T)=H_{C2}(0)\Bigg{[}\frac{(1-t^{2})}{(1+t^{2})}\Bigg{]}.\] (5)

The value obtained after fitting Eq. (5) is H_{C2}(0)=0.69\pm 0.01 T.

The orbital limiting field H_{C2}^{\mathrm{orbital}}(0) is the field where the Cooper pairs break due to an increased kinetic energy, and it is given by the Werthamar-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression [41, 42]

\[H_{C2}^{\mathrm{orbital}}(0)=-\alpha T_{C}\left.\frac{dH_{C2}(T)}{dT}\right|_{T =T_{C}},\] (6)

where \alpha is the purity factor given by 0.693 and 0.73 for superconductors in the dirty and clean limit, respectively. The initial slope \frac{-dH_{C2}(T)}{dT} in the vicinity of T=T_{C} yields a value of 0.67\pm 0.04 T/K, which gives H_{C2}^{\mathrm{orbital}}(0)=1.41\pm 0.08 T. Another mechanism that suppresses superconductivity is the Pauli-limiting field. According to the BCS theory, the Pauli-limiting field is given by H_{C2}^{\mathrm{eff}}(0)=1.86T_{C}, which for T_{C}=3.05\pm 0.05 K produces H_{C2}^{\mathrm{eff}}(0)=5.7\pm 0.1 T. The Maki parameter, which measures the relative strengths of the orbital and Pauli-limiting fields, was calculated using \alpha_{M}=\sqrt{2}H_{C2}^{\mathrm{orbit}}(0)/H_{C2}^{\mathrm{f}}(0)=0.16\pm 0.01. Such a small value of the Maki parameter implies that the effect of the Pauli limiting field is negligible.

The characteristic Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi_{\mathrm{GL}} can be evaluated using the H_{C2}(0) value from the relation [43]

\[H_{C2}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\,\xi_{\mathrm{GL}}^{2}},\] (7)

where \phi_{0} (=2.07\times 10^{-15} T m^{2}) is the magnetic flux quantum. Using H_{C2}(0)=0.69\pm 0.01 T, we estimated \xi_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)=218\pm 4 A. The Ginzburg-Landau penetration depth \lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}(0) can be calculated from the relation

\[H_{C1}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\,\lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}^{2}(0)}\Bigg{(}\mathrm{ ln}\frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)}{\xi_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)}+0.12\Bigg{)}.\] (8)

(b) Temperature dependence of lower critical field H_{C1}. The inset shows the low-field magnetization data at different temperatures. (c) Magnetization data collected at 1.95 K in the range -2\leqslant H\leqslant+2 T showing an irreversible field H_{\mathrm{nr}}=0.18 mT.

  Using the values of H_{C1}(0)=2.1\pm 0.2 mT and \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=218\pm 4 A, we calculated \lambda_{\rm GL}(0)=5047\pm 28 A. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter for the sample is calculated with the equation

\[\kappa_{\rm GL}=\frac{\lambda_{\rm GL}(0)}{\xi_{\rm GL}(0)}.\] (9)

This yields a value of \kappa_{\rm GL}=23\pm 1. For a type-II superconductor, \kappa_{\rm GL}\geqslant\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. Therefore, it is clear that LaPtGe is a type-II superconductor. The thermodynamic critical field H_{C} can be calculated using the relation H_{C1}(0)H_{C2}(0)=H_{C}^{2}\rm{ln}\kappa_{\rm GL}, giving the value as H_{C}=21\pm 1 mT.

### Specific heat

Specific-heat data were collected in the temperature range 1.9\leqslant T\leqslant 300 K. The bulk nature of the superconducting state is evidenced by the occurrence of a well-developed discontinuity at T_{C}=2.9\pm 0.05 K. The normal-state specific-heat data can be extracted by the relation

\[\frac{C}{T}=\gamma_{n}+\beta_{3}T^{2}+\beta_{5}T^{4}.\] (10)

This represents the contribution from the electronic as well as the phononic origin to the total specific heat. Fitting the above equation in the data above T_{C} determines the Sommerfeld coefficient (\gamma_{n}), which describes the electronic contribution, the Debye constant (\beta_{3}) representing the phononic contribution, and \beta_{5} representing the anharmonic contribution. The solid blue line in the inset of Fig. 5 in the normal-state region (10\leqslant T^{2}\leqslant 60 K) represents the best fit to the data, which yields \gamma_{n}=6.6\pm 0.2 mJ/mol K^{2}, \beta_{3}=1.83\pm 0.01 mJ/mol K^{4}, and \beta_{5}=0.000\pm 0.000\pm 0.000 mJ/mol K^{6}. The Debye temperature \theta_{D} can be estimated with the relation [21]

\[\theta_{D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{4}RN}{5\beta_{3}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}},\] (11)

Here R=8.314 j mol^{-1} K^{-1} is the universal gas constant and N (=3) is the number of atoms per formula unit. The estimated value of \theta_{D}=147\pm 4 K is consistent with the value obtained from the parallel-resistor model. Under the assumption of a degenerate electron gas of noninteracting particles, the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{n} is proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level. The value of \gamma_{n} can be used to estimate the density of states at the Fermi level D_{C}(E_{\rm F}) via the relation

\[\gamma_{n}=\left(\frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}}{3}\right)D_{C}(E_{\rm F}),\] (12)

where k_{B} is Boltzmann's constant. Substituting \gamma_{n}=6.6\pm 0.2 mJ/mol K^{2} yields D_{C}(E_{\rm F})=2.8\pm 0.1\frac{\rm states}{\sqrt{\rm{F}\rm{L}}}. The electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{c\text{-ph}}, a dimensionless number that describes the coupling between the electron and the phonon, is given by McMillan's equation [44],

\[\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\text{ln}(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{C})}{(1-0. 62\mu^{*})\text{ln}(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{C})-1.04},\] (13)

where \mu^{*} is the repulsive screened Coulomb potential having typical material specific values in the range 0.1\leqslant\mu^{*}\leqslant 0.15, where 0.13 is used for intermetallic superconductors. Incorporating the values of \theta_{D} and T_{C} yields \lambda_{c\text{-ph}}=0.67\pm 0.03, which is comparable to those in noncentrosymmetric superconductors such as 0.63 in Re_{6}Hf [20] and 0.5 for LaRhSi_{3}[45] indicating that the electron-phonon coupling is moderately strong in LaPtGe. The bare band-structure density of states D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) and m_{\rm band}^{*} are related to D_{C}(E_{\rm F}) by the relations

\[D_{C}(E_{\rm F})=D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})(1+\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}),\] (14)

\[m^{*}=m_{\rm band}^{*}(1+\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}).\] (15)

Using the value of \lambda_{c\text{-ph}}=0.67 in Eqs. (14) and (15) yields D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.7\pm 0.1\frac{\rm states}{\sqrt{\rm{F}\rm{L}}} and the effective mass of quasiparticle as 1.67m_{e}, where we used m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{e}. The condensation energy U(0), which is the difference between the ground-state energies of the normal state and the superconducting state, can be estimated using the relation U(0)=\frac{1}{2}\Delta^{2}(0)D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) employing \Delta^{2}(0)=4.1\times 10^{-45} J and D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.1378\times 10^{43} J^{-1} mol^{-1} from specific-heat measurements to give U(0)=23.2\pm 0.4 mJ/mol.

The electronic contribution to the specific heat, C_{\rm{el}}(T), is calculated by subtracting the phononic contribution of the specific heat from the total specific heat C(T). The specific-heat jump \frac{\Delta C_{\rm{el}}}{T_{C}} at T_{C} is 7.72\pm 0.05 mJ/mol K^{2}. The normalized jump in specific heat is then obtained as \frac{\Delta C_{\rm{el}}}{\gamma_{n}T_{C}}=1.17\pm 0.06, which is lower than the BCS value 1.43. Similar low values have also been reported for isostructural compounds [46]. The temperature dependence of the specific heat in the superconducting state can be best described by a single-gap BCS expression for normalized entropy, S,

\[\frac{S}{\gamma_{n}T_{C}}=-\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\left(\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{C}} \right)\int_{0}^{\infty}[f\,\ln(f)+(1-f)\ln(1-f)]dy,\] (16)

where f(\xi)=\{\exp[E(\xi)/k_{B}T]+1\}^{-1} is the Fermi function, E(\xi)=\sqrt{\xi^{2}+\Delta^{2}(t)}, where E(\xi) is the energy of the normal electrons measured relative to the Fermi energy, y=\xi/\Delta(0), t=T/T_{C}, and \Delta(t)=\tanh(1.82[1.018[(1/t)-1])^{0.51}) is the

Figure 5: Temperature dependence of electronic specific-heat fitting with the isotropic BCS expression [Eq. (17)]. The inset shows the C/T vs T^{2} data fit to Eq. (10).

  BCS approximation for the temperature dependence of the energy gap. The normalized electronic specific heat is related to the normalized entropy by

\[\frac{C_{\text{el}}}{\gamma_{n}T_{C}}=t\frac{d(S/\gamma_{n}T_{C})}{dt},\] (17)

where C_{\text{el}} below T_{C} is described by the above equation, whereas above T_{C} it is equal to \gamma_{n}T_{C}. Figure 5 shows the fitting of the specific-heat data using Eq. (17). Fitting yields a value \alpha=\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{C}=1.6\pm 0.1, which is slightly less than the BCS value \alpha=1.76.

#### iii.2.4 Muon spin relaxation and rotation

Further analysis of the superconducting ground state of LaPtGe was carried out by muon spin rotation and relaxation (\muSR) measurements. Zero-field muon spin relaxation spectra (ZF-\muSR) collected at temperatures above and below T_{C} are shown in Fig. 6. The absence of any atomic moments associated with the magnetic structure was confirmed by the nonoscillatory nature of the spectrum within the time window of \muSR. The depolarization in such cases is accounted for by the presence of static, randomly oriented nuclear moments. In the absence of atomic moments, muon spin relaxation in zero field is given by the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe (KT) function [47]

\[G_{\text{KT}}(t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\big{(}1-\sigma_{\text{ZF}}^{2}t^{2} \big{)}\text{exp}\bigg{(}\frac{-\sigma_{\text{ZF}}^{2}t^{2}}{2}\bigg{)},\] (18)

where \sigma_{\text{ZF}} is the relaxation due to static, randomly oriented local fields associated with the nuclear moments at the muon site. The spectra can be well described by the function

\[A(t)=A_{1}G_{\text{KT}}(t)\text{exp}(-\Delta t)+A_{\text{BG}},\] (19)

where A_{1} corresponds to the initial asymmetry, \Delta is the electronic relaxation rate, which fluctuates on a timescale much faster than the muon timescale, and A_{\text{BG}} is the time-dependent background contribution from the muons stopped in the sample holder. The temperature dependence of the fit parameters \Lambda and \sigma showed no perceptible temperature dependence above and below T_{C}, indicating that time-reversal symmetry is preserved within the detection limit of \muSR for LaPtGe.

Transverse field muon spin rotation experiments (TF-\muSR) were performed in an applied field of 10 mT. Figure 7 shows the spectra collected above and below T_{C}. The enhanced depolarization rate below T_{C} is due to the field distribution, formed by the flux line lattice in the mixed state of the superconductor. Assuming the hexagonal vortex lattice for LaPtGe, the TF-\muSR precession signal is well described by the oscillatory decaying Gaussian function

\[G_{\text{TF}}(t)=A_{1}\text{exp}\bigg{(}\frac{-\sigma_{\text{TF}}^{2}t^{2}}{2} \bigg{)}\text{cos}(w_{1}t+\phi)+A_{2}\text{cos}(w_{2}t+\phi),\] (20)

where \omega_{1} and \omega_{2} are the frequencies of the muon precession signal and background, respectively, \phi is the initial phase offset, and \sigma_{\text{TF}} is the Gaussian muon spin depolarization rate. The value of \sigma_{\text{TF}} depends on the distribution of vortices in the superconducting state, which causes an increase in depolarization below T_{C}. \sigma_{\text{TF}}(T) at different applied fields in the range 10\leqslant H\leqslant 40 mT was extracted using Eq. (20) as shown in Fig. 8(a). The temperature-independent depolarization due to static fields arising from the nuclear magnetic moments \sigma_{N} adds in quadrature to the contribution from the field variation across the flux line lattice \sigma_{\text{FLL}},

\[\sigma_{\text{TF}}^{2}=\sigma_{N}^{2}+\sigma_{\text{FLL}}^{2}.\] (21)

The field dependence of the depolarization rate \sigma(H) was determined by making isothermal cuts to the \sigma_{\text{TF}}(T) and is shown in Fig. 8(b). According to Ginzburg-Landau theory, which explains the Abrikosov hexagonal lattice in a type-LI superconductor, the magnetic penetration depth \lambda is related to \sigma_{\text{FLL}} by [48]

\[\sigma_{\text{FLL}}\ (\mu\text{s}^{-1}) = 4.854\times 10^{4}(1-h)[1+1.21(1-\sqrt{h})^{3}]\times\lambda^{-2}\ (\text{nm}^{-2}),\] (22)

where h=H/H_{C2} is the reduced field and \phi_{0} is the magnetic flux quantum. The resulting fits to the data are shown as solid

Figure 6: ZF-\muSR spectra collected above (T=4.5 K) and below (T=0.3 K) the transition temperature. The solid line is a fit to Eq. (19).

  lines in Fig. 8(b). The estimated value of H_{C2} obtained using Eq. (22) (not shown here) is consistent with the resistivity and magnetization measurements. The temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2} is shown in Fig. 8(c), where \lambda^{-2} is assumed to be zero above T_{C}. The data show a characteristic plateau at low temperature followed by a decrease as temperature increases. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density can be calculated for an isotropic s-wave superconductor in the dirty limit using the expression

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=\frac{\Delta(T)}{\Delta(0)}\mathrm{ tanh}\bigg{[}\frac{\Delta(T)}{2k_{B}T}\bigg{]},\] (23)

where \Delta(T)=\Delta_{0}\mathrm{tanh}(1.82[1.018[(T_{C}/T)-1])^{0.51}) is the BCS approximation for the temperature dependence of the energy gap. The solid lines in Fig. 8(c) are a result of the fit to this model for the values of \lambda^{-2}(T). The fit yields a value of the energy gap as \Delta_{0}=0.46\pm 0.01 meV, which gives the BCS parameter \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{C}=1.79\pm 0.07, which is very close to the BCS value of 1.76 implying the moderately coupled nature of the sample. The specific-heat measurement also suggested the moderately coupled superelectrons, where \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{C}=1.6\pm 0.1. A slight difference in the energy gap value is due to the microscopic and macroscopic nature of \muSR and specific heat, respectively. So the specific-heat measurement along with the TF-\muSR results confirm that LaPtGe is an s-wave superconductor.

The quasiparticle number density per unit volume and mean free path is related to the Sommerfeld coefficient via the relation [49]

\[\gamma_{n}=\bigg{(}\frac{\pi}{3}\bigg{)}^{2/3}\frac{k_{B}^{2}m^{*}V_{\mathrm{r .u.}}n^{1/3}}{\hbar^{2}N_{A}},\] (24)

where k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, N_{A} is the Avogadro number, V_{\mathrm{f.u.}} is the volume of a formula unit, and m^{*} is the effective mass of quasiparticles. The electronic mean free path l and Fermi velocity v_{\mathrm{F}} are correlated with residual resistivity by the relation

\[l=\frac{3\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}}{e^{2}\rho_{0}m^{*2}v_{\mathrm{F}}^{2}}\] (25)

while the Fermi velocity v_{\mathrm{F}} can be written in terms of the effective mass and the carrier density by

\[n=\frac{1}{3\pi^{2}}\bigg{(}\frac{m^{*}v_{\mathrm{f}}}{\hbar}\bigg{)}^{3}.\] (26)

The dirty limit expression for the penetration depth \lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}(0) is given by

\[\lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)=\lambda_{L}\bigg{(}1+\frac{\xi_{0}}{l}\bigg{)}^{1/2},\] (27)

where \xi_{0} is the BCS coherence length. The London penetration depth \lambda_{L} is given by

\[\lambda_{L}=\bigg{(}\frac{m^{*}}{\mu_{0}ne^{2}}\bigg{)}^{1/2}.\] (28)

The BCS coherence length \xi_{0} and the Ginzburg-Landau coherence \xi_{\mathrm{GL}}(0) at T=0 K in the dirty limit is related by the expression

\[\frac{\xi_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)}{\xi_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\bigg{(}1+\frac{\xi _{0}}{l}\bigg{)}^{-1/2}.\] (29)

Equations (24)-(29) form a system of four equations that can be used to estimate the parameters m^{*}, n, l, and \xi_{0} as done in Ref. [39]. The system of equations was solved simultaneously using the values \gamma_{n}=6.6\pm 0.2 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}

\begin{table}

The estimated values are tabulated in Table 1. It is clear that \xi_{0}>l, indicating that LaPtGe is in the dirty limit. The estimated value of mean free path l is of the same order as observed in other noncentrosymmetric superconductors, where dirty limit superconductivity was observed [39, 52, 53].

For a 3D system, the Fermi temperature T_{F} is given by the relation

\[k_{B}T_{F}=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2}(3\pi^{2})^{2/3}\frac{n^{2/3}}{m^{*}},\] (30)

where n is the quasiparticle number density per unit volume.

According to Uemura _et al._[54], superconductors can be conveniently classified according to their \frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}} ratio. It was shown that for unconventional superconductors this ratio falls in the range 0.01\leqslant\frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}\leqslant 0.1.

Using the estimated value of n in Eq. (30) we get T_{F}=1158 K, giving \frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}=0.0026, which places LaPtGe away from the unconventional superconductors as shown by a solid red symbol in Fig. 9, where solid blue lines represent the band of unconventional superconductors.

## IV Conclusion

High-purity samples of LaPtGe are prepared by arc-melting. X-ray diffraction confirms that the sample crystallized in a noncentrosymmetric LaPtSi structure (space group no. 109). The sample exhibited superconductivity with a transition temperature T_{C}=3.05\pm 0.05 K. Comprehensive transport, magnetization, and heat-capacity measurements suggest that LaPtGe is a moderately coupled s-wave superconductor. Transverse field muon experiments further confirm that it is a moderately coupled s-wave superconductor. Zero-field \muSR measurements did not find any evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting ground state. The above-mentioned results suggest that the antisymmetric spin-orbital coupling does not affect the superconducting ground state. It is clearly important to work on more noncentrosymmetric superconductors with high antisymmetric spin-orbital coupling to understand the complex superconducting ground state of these superconductors.

###### Abstract

We report on the superconducting properties of noncentrosymmetric superconductor LaPtGe, which crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric \alpha-ThSi_{2} structure. The magnetization, resistivity, and specific-heat measurements confirm that LaPtGe is a type-II bulk superconductor with a transition temperature T_{c}=3.05\pm 0.05 K. Muon-spin relaxation/rotation measurements suggest that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting ground state.

## I Introduction

In recent years, several new superconducting materials have been discovered. Many of these new superconductors are described as "unconventional," as their superconducting properties deviate from traditional BCS theory [1]. Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) have emerged as an exciting class of new unconventional superconductors. The lack of inversion symmetry can make the pairing scenario different, which introduces the possibility of a vast array of exotic physics [2, 3, 4, 5]. A nontrivial antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) that arises due to an asymmetric electric-field gradient lifts the original conduction electron spin degeneracy at the Fermi level, splitting it into two sublevels [6]. This leads to an admix superconducting ground state that exhibits many exotic properties that have not been observed in conventional superconductors [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The admixed pairing state can be manipulated by tuning the ASOC, which directly controls the mixing ratio of the singlet/triplet pairing channel [16]. In addition, the importance of electronic correlations, which often facilitate the interaction between different pairing channels, cannot be neglected. Strongly correlated superconductors without inversion symmetry include CePtSi [17], Re_{6} (Zr,Hf,Ti) [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], and Ulr [24], while LaNiC_{2}[25], Li_{2}M_{3}B (M= Pd, Pt) [16, 26], and La_{7}Ir_{3}[27] are weakly correlated. Weakly correlated materials are of great importance since the effects of broken inversion symmetry and asymmetric spin-orbit coupling interactions can be more explicitly separated and understood.

At present, the major issue in this area is how the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling influences the parity mixing in these materials and the presence/absence of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). Until now, only a small number of superconductors have been discovered that exhibit TRSB [18, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32], which makes it difficult to determine the roles of asymmetric spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations in noncentrosymmetric superconductors. Therefore, it is crucial to search for new superconductors whose crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry.

In this paper, we report on a comprehensive study of the superconducting properties of the noncentrosymmetric ternary equiatomic compound LaPtGe, which is a ternary variant of \alpha-ThSi_{2} structure in which a three-dimensional network of three connected metalloid atoms is found with tetragonal symmetry [33]. Theoretical calculations on the ternary variant of the \alpha-ThSi_{2} compounds show strong spin-orbital coupling strength [34]. The calculation of Kneidinger _et al._ on the parent ternary compound LaPtSi revealed strong ASOC [35]. It is interesting to look for more compounds in the same family to find the effect of ASOC on the superconducting ground state, in particular LaPtGe in the present case. Here we have used resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity along with muon-spin spectroscopy to probe the gap symmetry and nature of the superconducting ground state.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline LaPtGe samples were prepared using a standard arc-melting technique. High-purity La (99.99%), Pt (99.99%), and Ge (99.99%) were taken in a stoichiometric ratio and melted in a water-cooled copper hearth under high-purity argon gas. The resulting ingot formed with the negligible mass loss was flipped and remelted several times to improve the homogeneity. The phase purity and crystal structure of the sample were confirmed by room-temperature x-ray diffraction measurement using a PANalytical diffractometer equipped with Cu K\alpha radiation (\lambda=1.5406 A). Magnetization measurements were done using a superconducting quantum interference device (MPMS 3, Quantum Design). The electrical resistivity and heat-capacity measurements of the sample were performed using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design). The \muSR experiments were carried out using a 100% spin-polarized pulse muon beam at ISIS facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, United Kingdom.

## III Results and discussion

### Sample characterization

The x-ray diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. 1. Rietveld refinement to the data was done using fullprof software, which shows that the sample crystallizes into a tetragonal, noncentrosymmetric structure (space group I4_i_md) with derived lattice parameters a=b=4.2655(2) A, c=14.9654(1) A. The lattice parameters obtained in this work are in good agreement with data reported previously [33]. A small impurity peak is observed around 40^{\circ} (denoted by an asterisk) due to Pt_{3}Ge. Any significant effect of this impurity phase is not observed in bulk and muon spectroscopy measurements. The inset in Fig. 1 shows the crystal structure of LaPtGe.

### Normal and superconducting state properties

#### 1. Electrical resistivity

The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) of LaPtGe in the temperature range 1.8-300 K in zero applied magnetic field is shown in Fig. 2. A characteristic drop in resistivity, observed at T_{C}=3.05\pm 0.03 K, is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. The residual resistivity ratio is comparable to other LaNiSi structure compounds [35]. A high value of absolute resistivity with the saturation behavior at high temperatures indicates that the data can well be described by the parallel-resistor model [36]. The saturation at high temperatures typically happens when the apparent mean free path becomes short, of the order of a few interatomic spacings [37, 38]. In such a scenario, the scattering cross section will not be linear in scattering perturbation. At high temperatures, the dominant temperature-dependent scattering mechanism is the electron-phonon interaction. So the resistivity will not be proportional to the mean-square atomic displacement, which is proportional to T for the harmonic potential. Instead, it will rise less rapidly with T showing a saturating behavior. In general, the electrical resistivity of a metal, for T>T_{C}, can be written as [36, 39]

\[\rho_{i}(T)=\rho_{i,0}+\rho_{i,L}(T).\] (1)

In this relation, the temperature-independent residual resistivity, which arises from impurities and disorder, is denoted by \rho_{i,0}, while the second term adds the temperature-dependent general resistivity, which can be written according to the generalized Bloch-Gruneisen expression [40]

\[\rho_{i,L}(T)=C\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{D}/T} \frac{x^{5}}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-1})}dx,\] (2)

where \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature obtained from resistivity measurements, while C is a material-dependent prefactor. In the case of saturation resistivity, the resistivity curve, considering the saturation at high temperature can be explained by

\[\rho(T)=\left[\frac{1}{\rho_{s}}+\frac{1}{\rho_{i}(T)}\right]^{-1},\] (3)

where \rho_{s} is the temperature-independent saturation value of resistivity, which will be attained at high temperatures.

A fit employing this model is shown in Fig. 2, and it yields a Debye temperature \Theta_{D}=139\pm 3 K, C=936\pm 7\mu\Omega cm, residual resistivity \rho_{i,0}=253\pm 2\mu\Omega cm, \rho_{s}=848\pm 4\mu\Omega cm. The values of the fit parameters are similar to those obtained for other intermetallic samples [39].

#### 2. Magnetization

Figure 3(a) shows the dc susceptibility data taken in an applied field of 2 mT in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled-cooling (FCC) modes. Superconductivity defined as the onset of the diamagnetization signal appears at T_{c}^{\text{onset}}=3.05\pm 0.05 K. The Meissner fraction value exceeds 100% due to the uncorrected geometrical demagnetization factor. The temperature-independent paramagnetic behavior for T>T_{C} suggests the absence of any magnetic impurities in the sample. The low-field magnetization measurement as a function of applied magnetic field (0-10 mT) is taken at different temperatures to calculate the lower critical field H_{C1} [see the inset in Fig. 3(b)]. The first deviation from linearity from the initial slope is taken as the basis to determine H_{C1} for all the respective temperatures. Figure 3(b) depicts the resulting temperature dependence of H_{C1}, which is fitted by

Figure 2: Temperature dependence of resistivity in the range 1.8\leqslant T\leqslant 300 K. The inset shows the drop in resistivity at the superconducting transition, T_{C}=3.05\pm 0.03 K. The normal-state resistivity is fitted with the parallel-resistor model in the temperature range 5\leqslant T\leqslant 300 K.

  the Ginzburg-Landau equation

\[H_{C1}(T)=H_{C1}(0)\Bigg{[}1-\left(\frac{T}{T_{C}}\right)^{2}\Bigg{]}.\] (4)

The value of H_{C1}(0) was estimated to be 2.1\pm 0.2 mT after fitting Eq. (4) in the H_{C1}(T) plot. Figure 3(c) presents the high-field magnetization loop collected at 1.95 K in the magnetic-field range \pm 2 T. The magnetic behavior exhibits conventional type-II superconductivity with an irreversible nature of magnetization below H_{\mathrm{nr}}=0.18 mT, above which point the applied field becomes strong enough to depin the vortices.

To measure the upper critical field as a function of temperature, H_{C2}(T), the shift in T_{C} in different applied magnetic fields was determined from magnetization and resistivity data. Resistivity measurement as a function of temperature, \rho(T), was performed at different applied magnetic fields up to 0.36 T (see the inset of Fig. 4). Figure 4 displays the linear variation of H_{C2}(T) when plotted against the reduced temperature t=T/T_{C}. Both resistivity and magnetization are in good agreement with the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) relation,

\[H_{C2}(T)=H_{C2}(0)\Bigg{[}\frac{(1-t^{2})}{(1+t^{2})}\Bigg{]}.\] (5)

The value obtained after fitting Eq. (5) is H_{C2}(0)=0.69\pm 0.01 T.

The orbital limiting field H_{C2}^{\mathrm{orbital}}(0) is the field where the Cooper pairs break due to an increased kinetic energy, and it is given by the Werthamar-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression [41, 42]

\[H_{C2}^{\mathrm{orbital}}(0)=-\alpha T_{C}\left.\frac{dH_{C2}(T)}{dT}\right|_{T =T_{C}},\] (6)

where \alpha is the purity factor given by 0.693 and 0.73 for superconductors in the dirty and clean limit, respectively. The initial slope \frac{-dH_{C2}(T)}{dT} in the vicinity of T=T_{C} yields a value of 0.67\pm 0.04 T/K, which gives H_{C2}^{\mathrm{orbital}}(0)=1.41\pm 0.08 T. Another mechanism that suppresses superconductivity is the Pauli-limiting field. According to the BCS theory, the Pauli-limiting field is given by H_{C2}^{\mathrm{eff}}(0)=1.86T_{C}, which for T_{C}=3.05\pm 0.05 K produces H_{C2}^{\mathrm{eff}}(0)=5.7\pm 0.1 T. The Maki parameter, which measures the relative strengths of the orbital and Pauli-limiting fields, was calculated using \alpha_{M}=\sqrt{2}H_{C2}^{\mathrm{orbit}}(0)/H_{C2}^{\mathrm{f}}(0)=0.16\pm 0.01. Such a small value of the Maki parameter implies that the effect of the Pauli limiting field is negligible.

The characteristic Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi_{\mathrm{GL}} can be evaluated using the H_{C2}(0) value from the relation [43]

\[H_{C2}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\,\xi_{\mathrm{GL}}^{2}},\] (7)

where \phi_{0} (=2.07\times 10^{-15} T m^{2}) is the magnetic flux quantum. Using H_{C2}(0)=0.69\pm 0.01 T, we estimated \xi_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)=218\pm 4 A. The Ginzburg-Landau penetration depth \lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}(0) can be calculated from the relation

\[H_{C1}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\,\lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}^{2}(0)}\Bigg{(}\mathrm{ ln}\frac{\lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)}{\xi_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)}+0.12\Bigg{)}.\] (8)

  Using the values of H_{C1}(0)=2.1\pm 0.2 mT and \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=218\pm 4 A, we calculated \lambda_{\rm GL}(0)=5047\pm 28 A. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter for the sample is calculated with the equation

\[\kappa_{\rm GL}=\frac{\lambda_{\rm GL}(0)}{\xi_{\rm GL}(0)}.\] (9)

This yields a value of \kappa_{\rm GL}=23\pm 1. For a type-II superconductor, \kappa_{\rm GL}\geqslant\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. Therefore, it is clear that LaPtGe is a type-II superconductor. The thermodynamic critical field H_{C} can be calculated using the relation H_{C1}(0)H_{C2}(0)=H_{C}^{2}\rm{ln}\kappa_{\rm GL}, giving the value as H_{C}=21\pm 1 mT.

### Specific heat

Specific-heat data were collected in the temperature range 1.9\leqslant T\leqslant 300 K. The bulk nature of the superconducting state is evidenced by the occurrence of a well-developed discontinuity at T_{C}=2.9\pm 0.05 K. The normal-state specific-heat data can be extracted by the relation

\[\frac{C}{T}=\gamma_{n}+\beta_{3}T^{2}+\beta_{5}T^{4}.\] (10)

This represents the contribution from the electronic as well as the phononic origin to the total specific heat. Fitting the above equation in the data above T_{C} determines the Sommerfeld coefficient (\gamma_{n}), which describes the electronic contribution, the Debye constant (\beta_{3}) representing the phononic contribution, and \beta_{5} representing the anharmonic contribution. The solid blue line in the inset of Fig. 5 in the normal-state region (10\leqslant T^{2}\leqslant 60 K) represents the best fit to the data, which yields \gamma_{n}=6.6\pm 0.2 mJ/mol K^{2}, \beta_{3}=1.83\pm 0.01 mJ/mol K^{4}, and \beta_{5}=0.000\pm 0.000\pm 0.000 mJ/mol K^{6}. The Debye temperature \theta_{D} can be estimated with the relation [21]

\[\theta_{D}=\left(\frac{12\pi^{4}RN}{5\beta_{3}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}},\] (11)

Here R=8.314 j mol^{-1} K^{-1} is the universal gas constant and N (=3) is the number of atoms per formula unit. The estimated value of \theta_{D}=147\pm 4 K is consistent with the value obtained from the parallel-resistor model. Under the assumption of a degenerate electron gas of noninteracting particles, the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma_{n} is proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level. The value of \gamma_{n} can be used to estimate the density of states at the Fermi level D_{C}(E_{\rm F}) via the relation

\[\gamma_{n}=\left(\frac{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}}{3}\right)D_{C}(E_{\rm F}),\] (12)

where k_{B} is Boltzmann's constant. Substituting \gamma_{n}=6.6\pm 0.2 mJ/mol K^{2} yields D_{C}(E_{\rm F})=2.8\pm 0.1\frac{\rm states}{\sqrt{\rm{F}\rm{L}}}. The electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{c\text{-ph}}, a dimensionless number that describes the coupling between the electron and the phonon, is given by McMillan's equation [44],

\[\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\text{ln}(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{C})}{(1-0. 62\mu^{*})\text{ln}(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{C})-1.04},\] (13)

where \mu^{*} is the repulsive screened Coulomb potential having typical material specific values in the range 0.1\leqslant\mu^{*}\leqslant 0.15, where 0.13 is used for intermetallic superconductors. Incorporating the values of \theta_{D} and T_{C} yields \lambda_{c\text{-ph}}=0.67\pm 0.03, which is comparable to those in noncentrosymmetric superconductors such as 0.63 in Re_{6}Hf [20] and 0.5 for LaRhSi_{3}[45] indicating that the electron-phonon coupling is moderately strong in LaPtGe. The bare band-structure density of states D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) and m_{\rm band}^{*} are related to D_{C}(E_{\rm F}) by the relations

\[D_{C}(E_{\rm F})=D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})(1+\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}),\] (14)

\[m^{*}=m_{\rm band}^{*}(1+\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}).\] (15)

Using the value of \lambda_{c\text{-ph}}=0.67 in Eqs. (14) and (15) yields D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.7\pm 0.1\frac{\rm states}{\sqrt{\rm{F}\rm{L}}} and the effective mass of quasiparticle as 1.67m_{e}, where we used m_{\rm band}^{*}=m_{e}. The condensation energy U(0), which is the difference between the ground-state energies of the normal state and the superconducting state, can be estimated using the relation U(0)=\frac{1}{2}\Delta^{2}(0)D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F}) employing \Delta^{2}(0)=4.1\times 10^{-45} J and D_{\rm band}(E_{\rm F})=1.1378\times 10^{43} J^{-1} mol^{-1} from specific-heat measurements to give U(0)=23.2\pm 0.4 mJ/mol.

The electronic contribution to the specific heat, C_{\rm{el}}(T), is calculated by subtracting the phononic contribution of the specific heat from the total specific heat C(T). The specific-heat jump \frac{\Delta C_{\rm{el}}}{T_{C}} at T_{C} is 7.72\pm 0.05 mJ/mol K^{2}. The normalized jump in specific heat is then obtained as \frac{\Delta C_{\rm{el}}}{\gamma_{n}T_{C}}=1.17\pm 0.06, which is lower than the BCS value 1.43. Similar low values have also been reported for isostructural compounds [46]. The temperature dependence of the specific heat in the superconducting state can be best described by a single-gap BCS expression for normalized entropy, S,

\[\frac{S}{\gamma_{n}T_{C}}=-\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\left(\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{C}} \right)\int_{0}^{\infty}[f\,\ln(f)+(1-f)\ln(1-f)]dy,\] (16)

where f(\xi)=\{\exp[E(\xi)/k_{B}T]+1\}^{-1} is the Fermi function, E(\xi)=\sqrt{\xi^{2}+\Delta^{2}(t)}, where E(\xi) is the energy of the normal electrons measured relative to the Fermi energy, y=\xi/\Delta(0), t=T/T_{C}, and \Delta(t)=\tanh(1.82[1.018[(1/t)-1])^{0.51}) is the

  BCS approximation for the temperature dependence of the energy gap. The normalized electronic specific heat is related to the normalized entropy by

\[\frac{C_{\text{el}}}{\gamma_{n}T_{C}}=t\frac{d(S/\gamma_{n}T_{C})}{dt},\] (17)

where C_{\text{el}} below T_{C} is described by the above equation, whereas above T_{C} it is equal to \gamma_{n}T_{C}. Figure 5 shows the fitting of the specific-heat data using Eq. (17). Fitting yields a value \alpha=\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{C}=1.6\pm 0.1, which is slightly less than the BCS value \alpha=1.76.

#### iii.2.4 Muon spin relaxation and rotation

Further analysis of the superconducting ground state of LaPtGe was carried out by muon spin rotation and relaxation (\muSR) measurements. Zero-field muon spin relaxation spectra (ZF-\muSR) collected at temperatures above and below T_{C} are shown in Fig. 6. The absence of any atomic moments associated with the magnetic structure was confirmed by the nonoscillatory nature of the spectrum within the time window of \muSR. The depolarization in such cases is accounted for by the presence of static, randomly oriented nuclear moments. In the absence of atomic moments, muon spin relaxation in zero field is given by the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe (KT) function [47]

\[G_{\text{KT}}(t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\big{(}1-\sigma_{\text{ZF}}^{2}t^{2} \big{)}\text{exp}\bigg{(}\frac{-\sigma_{\text{ZF}}^{2}t^{2}}{2}\bigg{)},\] (18)

where \sigma_{\text{ZF}} is the relaxation due to static, randomly oriented local fields associated with the nuclear moments at the muon site. The spectra can be well described by the function

\[A(t)=A_{1}G_{\text{KT}}(t)\text{exp}(-\Delta t)+A_{\text{BG}},\] (19)

where A_{1} corresponds to the initial asymmetry, \Delta is the electronic relaxation rate, which fluctuates on a timescale much faster than the muon timescale, and A_{\text{BG}} is the time-dependent background contribution from the muons stopped in the sample holder. The temperature dependence of the fit parameters \Lambda and \sigma showed no perceptible temperature dependence above and below T_{C}, indicating that time-reversal symmetry is preserved within the detection limit of \muSR for LaPtGe.

Transverse field muon spin rotation experiments (TF-\muSR) were performed in an applied field of 10 mT. Figure 7 shows the spectra collected above and below T_{C}. The enhanced depolarization rate below T_{C} is due to the field distribution, formed by the flux line lattice in the mixed state of the superconductor. Assuming the hexagonal vortex lattice for LaPtGe, the TF-\muSR precession signal is well described by the oscillatory decaying Gaussian function

\[G_{\text{TF}}(t)=A_{1}\text{exp}\bigg{(}\frac{-\sigma_{\text{TF}}^{2}t^{2}}{2} \bigg{)}\text{cos}(w_{1}t+\phi)+A_{2}\text{cos}(w_{2}t+\phi),\] (20)

where \omega_{1} and \omega_{2} are the frequencies of the muon precession signal and background, respectively, \phi is the initial phase offset, and \sigma_{\text{TF}} is the Gaussian muon spin depolarization rate. The value of \sigma_{\text{TF}} depends on the distribution of vortices in the superconducting state, which causes an increase in depolarization below T_{C}. \sigma_{\text{TF}}(T) at different applied fields in the range 10\leqslant H\leqslant 40 mT was extracted using Eq. (20) as shown in Fig. 8(a). The temperature-independent depolarization due to static fields arising from the nuclear magnetic moments \sigma_{N} adds in quadrature to the contribution from the field variation across the flux line lattice \sigma_{\text{FLL}},

\[\sigma_{\text{TF}}^{2}=\sigma_{N}^{2}+\sigma_{\text{FLL}}^{2}.\] (21)

The field dependence of the depolarization rate \sigma(H) was determined by making isothermal cuts to the \sigma_{\text{TF}}(T) and is shown in Fig. 8(b). According to Ginzburg-Landau theory, which explains the Abrikosov hexagonal lattice in a type-LI superconductor, the magnetic penetration depth \lambda is related to \sigma_{\text{FLL}} by [48]

\[\sigma_{\text{FLL}}\ (\mu\text{s}^{-1}) = 4.854\times 10^{4}(1-h)[1+1.21(1-\sqrt{h})^{3}]\times\lambda^{-2}\ (\text{nm}^{-2}),\] (22)

where h=H/H_{C2} is the reduced field and \phi_{0} is the magnetic flux quantum. The resulting fits to the data are shown as solid

Figure 6: ZF-\muSR spectra collected above (T=4.5 K) and below (T=0.3 K) the transition temperature. The solid line is a fit to Eq. (19).

  lines in Fig. 8(b). The estimated value of H_{C2} obtained using Eq. (22) (not shown here) is consistent with the resistivity and magnetization measurements. The temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2} is shown in Fig. 8(c), where \lambda^{-2} is assumed to be zero above T_{C}. The data show a characteristic plateau at low temperature followed by a decrease as temperature increases. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density can be calculated for an isotropic s-wave superconductor in the dirty limit using the expression

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=\frac{\Delta(T)}{\Delta(0)}\mathrm{ tanh}\bigg{[}\frac{\Delta(T)}{2k_{B}T}\bigg{]},\] (23)

where \Delta(T)=\Delta_{0}\mathrm{tanh}(1.82[1.018[(T_{C}/T)-1])^{0.51}) is the BCS approximation for the temperature dependence of the energy gap. The solid lines in Fig. 8(c) are a result of the fit to this model for the values of \lambda^{-2}(T). The fit yields a value of the energy gap as \Delta_{0}=0.46\pm 0.01 meV, which gives the BCS parameter \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{C}=1.79\pm 0.07, which is very close to the BCS value of 1.76 implying the moderately coupled nature of the sample. The specific-heat measurement also suggested the moderately coupled superelectrons, where \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{C}=1.6\pm 0.1. A slight difference in the energy gap value is due to the microscopic and macroscopic nature of \muSR and specific heat, respectively. So the specific-heat measurement along with the TF-\muSR results confirm that LaPtGe is an s-wave superconductor.

The quasiparticle number density per unit volume and mean free path is related to the Sommerfeld coefficient via the relation [49]

\[\gamma_{n}=\bigg{(}\frac{\pi}{3}\bigg{)}^{2/3}\frac{k_{B}^{2}m^{*}V_{\mathrm{r .u.}}n^{1/3}}{\hbar^{2}N_{A}},\] (24)

where k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, N_{A} is the Avogadro number, V_{\mathrm{f.u.}} is the volume of a formula unit, and m^{*} is the effective mass of quasiparticles. The electronic mean free path l and Fermi velocity v_{\mathrm{F}} are correlated with residual resistivity by the relation

\[l=\frac{3\pi^{2}\hbar^{3}}{e^{2}\rho_{0}m^{*2}v_{\mathrm{F}}^{2}}\] (25)

while the Fermi velocity v_{\mathrm{F}} can be written in terms of the effective mass and the carrier density by

\[n=\frac{1}{3\pi^{2}}\bigg{(}\frac{m^{*}v_{\mathrm{f}}}{\hbar}\bigg{)}^{3}.\] (26)

The dirty limit expression for the penetration depth \lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}(0) is given by

\[\lambda_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)=\lambda_{L}\bigg{(}1+\frac{\xi_{0}}{l}\bigg{)}^{1/2},\] (27)

where \xi_{0} is the BCS coherence length. The London penetration depth \lambda_{L} is given by

\[\lambda_{L}=\bigg{(}\frac{m^{*}}{\mu_{0}ne^{2}}\bigg{)}^{1/2}.\] (28)

The BCS coherence length \xi_{0} and the Ginzburg-Landau coherence \xi_{\mathrm{GL}}(0) at T=0 K in the dirty limit is related by the expression

\[\frac{\xi_{\mathrm{GL}}(0)}{\xi_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\bigg{(}1+\frac{\xi _{0}}{l}\bigg{)}^{-1/2}.\] (29)

Equations (24)-(29) form a system of four equations that can be used to estimate the parameters m^{*}, n, l, and \xi_{0} as done in Ref. [39]. The system of equations was solved simultaneously using the values \gamma_{n}=6.6\pm 0.2 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} Parameters & Unit & LaPtGe \\ \hline T_{C} & K & 3.05 \\ H_{C1}(0) & mT & 2.1 \\ H_{C2}(0) & T & 0.69 \\ H_{C2}^{*}(0) & T & 5.67 \\ \xi_{\mathrm{GL}} & Å & 218 \\ \lambda_{\mathrm{GL}} & Å & 5047 \\ k_{\mathrm{GL}} & & 23 \\ \Delta C_{\mathrm{eff}}/\gamma_{n}T_{C} & & 1.17 \\ \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{C} & & 1.6 \\ m^{*}/m_{e} & & 7.08 \\ n & 1  \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=218\pm 4 A, and \rho_{0}=253\pm 2\mu\Omega cm. The estimated values are tabulated in Table 1. It is clear that \xi_{0}>l, indicating that LaPtGe is in the dirty limit. The estimated value of mean free path l is of the same order as observed in other noncentrosymmetric superconductors, where dirty limit superconductivity was observed [39, 52, 53].

For a 3D system, the Fermi temperature T_{F} is given by the relation

\[k_{B}T_{F}=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2}(3\pi^{2})^{2/3}\frac{n^{2/3}}{m^{*}},\] (30)

where n is the quasiparticle number density per unit volume.

According to Uemura _et al._[54], superconductors can be conveniently classified according to their \frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}} ratio. It was shown that for unconventional superconductors this ratio falls in the range 0.01\leqslant\frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}\leqslant 0.1.

Using the estimated value of n in Eq. (30) we get T_{F}=1158 K, giving \frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}=0.0026, which places LaPtGe away from the unconventional superconductors as shown by a solid red symbol in Fig. 9, where solid blue lines represent the band of unconventional superconductors.

## IV Conclusion

High-purity samples of LaPtGe are prepared by arc-melting. X-ray diffraction confirms that the sample crystallized in a noncentrosymmetric LaPtSi structure (space group no. 109). The sample exhibited superconductivity with a transition temperature T_{C}=3.05\pm 0.05 K. Comprehensive transport, magnetization, and heat-capacity measurements suggest that LaPtGe is a moderately coupled s-wave superconductor. Transverse field muon experiments further confirm that it is a moderately coupled s-wave superconductor. Zero-field \muSR measurements did not find any evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting ground state. The above-mentioned results suggest that the antisymmetric spin-orbital coupling does not affect the superconducting ground state. It is clearly important to work on more noncentrosymmetric superconductors with high antisymmetric spin-orbital coupling to understand the complex superconducting ground state of these superconductors.
