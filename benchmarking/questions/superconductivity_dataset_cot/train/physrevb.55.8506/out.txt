###### Abstract

The in-plane resistivity, in-plane absolute thermopower, and upper critical field measurements are reported for single-crystal samples of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C superconductors. The in-plane resistivity shows metallic behavior and varies approximately linearly with temperature near room temperature (RT) but shows nearly quadratic behavior in temperature at low temperatures. The YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C single-crystal samples exhibit large transverse magnetoresistance (\approx 6 - 8 % at 45 kOe) in the _ab_ plane. The absolute thermopower _S_(_T_) is negative from RT to the superconducting transition temperature _T_c . Its magnitude at RT is a few times of the value for apical good metal. _S_(_T_) is approximately linear in temperature between ~150 K and RT. Extrapolation to T = 0 gives large intercepts (few _Î¼_/K) for both samples suggesting the presence of a much larger "knee" than would be expected from electron-phonon interaction renormalization effects. The upper critical fields for H parallel and perpendicular to the c axis and the superconducting parameters derived from it do not show any anisotropy for the YNi2B2C single-crystal samples in agreement with magnetization and torque magnetometry measurements, but a small anisotropy is observed for the LuNi2B2C single crystals. The analysis shows that these are moderately strong-coupling type-II superconductors (similar to the A - 15 compounds) with a value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter _l_(0) approximately equal to 1.2 for YNi2B2C and 1.0 for LuNi2B2C, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length _l_(0) approximately equal to 70 A, and _H__c_2(0) ~ 60 - 70 kOe. The temperature dependence of the upper critical field shows a positive curvature near _T_c in disagreement with the Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki (WHHM) theory but in agreement with a recent solution of the Gor'kov equation using a basis formed by Landau levels (Bahcall); however, the data show a severe disagreement between the observed low-temperature behavior of _H__c_2(_T_) and that predicted either by WHHM or Bahcall's expressions.

## Introduction

The latest discovery of superconductivity in intermetallic borocarbide compounds, namely, YNi2B2C (Refs. 1 and 2) (T_{c} = 15.6 K), multiphase Y-Pd-B-C (Ref. 2) (superconducting transition temperature, T_{c} = 23.2 K), _R_Ni2B2C (Refs. 3-6) (Lu-Gd; T_{c} = 16.6 K for Lu) has had enormous impact on superconductivity research during the last two years and has led to renewed interest in the search for high-temperature superconductivity in multielement intermetallic compounds and possibly exotic superconductivity mechanism(s) leading to T_{c} higher than 10 K. T_{c} values of these borocarbides are similar to those of the other well-known high-_T__c_ intermetallic A - 15 superconductors.7 Two fascinating features of _R_Ni2B2C compounds are that they contain a large amount of nickel, a ferromagnetic metal usually detrimental to superconductivity, and that superconductivity is observed not only for the nonmagnetic rare-earth elements but also for the heavy magnetic rare earths like Tm, Er, Ho, and Dy having a large saturation magnetic moment. They exhibit a spectrum of very interesting physical properties depending upon the R atom; compounds with R = Y, Lu seem to be isotropic,8 BCS-type9 superconductors with relatively high T_{c} ; R = Yb belongs to the heavy fermion system10,11 and is not superconducting down to 0.34 K;11R = Tm-Dy exhibit the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic order (generally antiferromagnetic) with additional effects due to anisotropy induced by crystalline electric fields.5,12-17 Compounds with R = Tb and Gd are not superconducting at least above 0.5 and 1.4 K, respectively.18-22

The structure of these compounds is body-centered-tetragonal (space group _I4/mmm_) with alternating square-planar layers of rare-earth carbides and corrugated Ni2B2 sheets with a unit cell consisting of two formula units.23 This is the same as the ThCr2Si2 structure with an additional carbon atom per rare-earth atom in the rare-earth layer. The structure has Ni-B sheets running parallel to the basal plane and seems to be highly anisotropic from the view point of the ratio of _c_/_a_ which is approximately 3 for both YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C compounds since their lattice parameters are a = 3.526 A, c = 10.534 A [YNi2B2C (Ref. 24)] and a = 3.464 A, c = 10.631 A [LuNi2B2C (Ref. 23)], respectively. These characteristics are somewhat similar to those of cuprate superconductors although the T_{c} for the borocarbides is much smaller than that of the cuprates. The electronic structure of transition-metal borides and carbides has generally been characterized by strong covalent bonding between the constituent elements,25 but band-structure calculations on LuNi2B2C (Refs. 26-30) and YNi2B2C (Refs. 26, 31) show that these are thoroughly three-dimensional metals belonging to the family of conventional superconductors with a relatively high density of states at the Fermi level E_{F} . The states near the Fermi level are dominated by the Ni(3_d_) character with some contributions from other atoms. Ni(3_d_), and B(2_p_) states hybridize by a very small amount around E_{F}, but the strength of such a hybridization is not so great as that of Cu-O hybridization within CuO2 planes in high-_T__c_ cuprates, and bridging carbon atoms provide strong interlayer interactions which lead to the three-dimensional structure.30 The calculated density of states shows a peak at E_{F} arising from a relatively dispersionless energy band which is close to E_{F}.26 No peak in the density of states at E_{F} has been observed32,33 in photoemission studies on polycrystalline YNi2B2C, the absence of which has been attributed to the effects of electron correlations due to the presence of nickel, a 3_d_-late transition metal, which gives rise to strong electron correlations. One might expect nickel to give rise to possible magnetism in these compounds, but no local magnetic moment on Ni atoms has been inferred either from neutron-diffraction measurements on polycrystalline samples down to 2 K (Ref. 21) or from NMR experiments34 on single-crystal YNi2B2C although earlier NMR studies on polycrystalline YNi2B2C (Ref. 35) and muon spin-rotation measurements of the internal field in polycrystalline TmNi2B2C (Ref. 36) suggest the existence of dynamically fluctuating moments on Ni atoms. Since Ni-derived 3d electrons are considered to be superconducting electrons in these compounds, the possibility of the existence of a localized moment on Ni atoms is not reasonable since it would lead to strong pair breaking if superconductivity is due to _s_-wave pairing. Boron in these compounds, it is speculated, gives rise to higher phonon frequencies because of its low mass, and consequently a high T_{c}. Both a band-structure calculation28 and an isotope experiment37 seem to confirm that the high-frequency optical phonons associated with B atoms play an important role in the superconductivity of these compounds. The role of carbon is not clear although it is absolutely essential since YNi2B does not show superconductivity. A recent structural study38 on polycrystalline YNi2B2C reported highly anisotropic thermal vibrations of C atoms and may have some bearing on the high T_{c} of these compounds.

Since the discovery of these borocarbide superconductors, extensive studies have been done on their superconducting properties and the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism in some of these compounds in the polycrystalline state as well as with single crystals.39 A number of superconducting studies indicate that these are type-II superconductors with a small coherence length (~50-100 A). Theoretical studies26-31 as well as some experimental reports24,40,41 indicate that these are moderately strong-coupling superconductors, and the observation of soft phonon modes for R =Lu (Ref. 42) seems to suggest the same, but recent tunneling measurements9 show them to be weak-coupling BCS type. Many experimental results indicate that these compounds are the conventional phonon-mediated _s_-wave superconductors although some deviations are reported, namely absence of the coherent peak in the NMR relaxation rate below T_{c},43T^{3} dependence of the specific heat in a wide range of temperatures below T_{c},24 and anomalous non-BCS temperature dependence of _H__c_1,l(_T_,H = 0) and microwave impedance.44 Each family of superconductors so far discovered, including A -15 compounds, Cheverl compounds, cuprates, and fullerides, possesses characteristic structural and electronic features which have important bearing on the occurrence of superconductivity in them. Normal-state transport properties of superconductors provide important information which is expected to lead to an understanding of superconductivity in them. The recent availability of good single crystals of these borocarbides provides a unique opportunity to investigate the normal-state transport properties in well characterized samples without the granularity problems present in polycrystalline samples which could be detrimental to interpretation of results on transport properties. While there has been feverish activity on studies of the superconducting properties, and the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in these borocarbides, there are hardly any reports on studies of the normal-state transport properties of these compounds except our preliminary reports14,39,45 on single-crystal R Ni2B2C, (_R_ = Y, Lu-Gd), recent brief reports on thermopower46 of polycrystalline YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C, and the thermal conductivity of YNi2B2C and HoNi2B2C single crystals.47 In this paper we present results of detailed studies on in-plane electrical resistivity and thermopower in single crystals of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C along with their superconducting properties. While YNi2B2C is a widely investigated compound, only a few reports have appeared on LuNi2B2C. These compounds do not show any sign of magnetic order or crystal-field effects which do influence the transport properties of the analogous compounds with other rare earths and make interpretation of their transport properties more difficult. Results are compared with the high-_T__c_ cuprates and A -15 compound superconductors wherever appropriate.

## Experimental Details

Single crystals of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C are grown by a Ni2B flux method.48 An arc-melted and well-annealed single-phase polycrystalline ingot of YNi2B2C (LuNi2B2C) compound is placed in an alumina crucible with an equal mass of Ni2B on top of it and is melted in flowing pure argon gas at 1763 K. The melt is cooled to 1473 K at 10 K/h, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature (RT). Single crystals of YNi2B2C (LuNi2B2C) grow into the flux from the original polycrystalline compound. These crystals can be easily removed from the original polycrystalline ingot. The crystals are platelike having mostly irregular shapes with surfaces in the _ab_ plane. The x-ray diffraction of these platelets show that they are single crystals of YNi2B2C (LuNi2B2C) with the c axis perpendicular to the flat surfaces. The as-grown single-crystal platelets usually have somewhat rough surfaces with a metallic shine and luster.

The flux-free single-crystal platelets are cut into rectangular parallelepiped shapes using a wire saw for the resistivity and thermoelectric power measurements. The typical size of these samples is 2.0 mm x 1.0 mm x 0.3 mm. The crystal surfaces are ground flat and then polished mechanically to remove the surface roughness and make them uniformly thick.

The resistivity is measured using a dc four-probe technique. Two 0.15 mm copper wires are attached to the sample as the current leads using indium solder. The voltage leads consist of two heavy formvar insulated 0.1 mm diameter copper wires which are attached to the sample with Epotek 410E silver epoxy.49 The maximum error in the absolute resistivity value comes mainly from the uncertainties in the distance between two voltage leads due to the finite width of  the electrical contacts (since the sample length is very small) and the thickness measurement. Considering all the possible errors, the uncertainty in the absolute resistivity is no more than +-10% and much less for relative measurements. The resistance in zero applied magnetic field is measured from RT (300 K) to 4.2 K and in applied magnetic field (maximum 5 T) between 25 and 4.2 K. A double can He-4 cryostat equipped with a 6 T superconducting magnet is used for the measurements. More experimental details can be found in an earlier publication.[14]

Thermopower of the samples is measured using a differential technique with temperature gradient along the _ab_ plane. Samples for thermopower measurements are cut from the same block of a single crystal of YNi_{2}B_{2}C (LuNi_{2}B_{2}C) from which samples for the resistance measurements were cut. The cryostat used for thermopower measurements is similar to the one described earlier[50] but with some improvements in its design and automatic data collection. The differential temperature across the sample is measured using a calibrated 0.075 mm diameter Au 0.07 % Fe/chromel thermocouple. The thermopower of each sample is measured against a 0.1 mm manganin wire precalibrated against a well annealed lead foil. Samples are kept in a 10^{-6} torr dynamic vacuum during the measurements. The absolute accuracy in the thermopower is estimated to be +-0.1 \muV/K.

## Results and Discussion

### Normal-state resistivity

Room-temperature (RT, 300 K) in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} of single crystals of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C are measured to be 67.1 and 46.8 \mu\Omega cm, respectively. The lower resistivity of single-crystal LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples is probably due to better growth of the crystal with less imperfections and/or defects. This is also reflected in the residual resistivity ratio (RR) as indicated later. These in-plane resistivity values are of the same order of magnitude as for some of binary alloys of the rare-earth and transition-metal intermetallic compounds/alloys[51] and some A -15 compounds.[7] Figure 1 displays the temperature dependence of \rho_{ab}, to be denoted \rho hereafter, of single-crystal samples of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C from 300 to 4.2 K and in zero applied magnetic field H. The resistivity is clearly seen to be metallic, i.e., \rho decreases with a decrease in temperature. This decrease in \rho is approximately linear with T at higher temperatures (near RT) although a slight curvature towards the T axis is clearly visible pointing to a possibility of saturation of the resistivity at higher temperatures. This curvature is slightly more in the case of the YNi_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal (sc) sample. [_dp_/_dT_]RT values for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C and sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C are 0.22 and 0.15 \mu\Omega cm/K, respectively. As the temperature is lowered below ~100 K, the resistivity becomes nonlinear and finally drops abruptly to zero at the superconducting transition temperatures 15.6 and 16.1 K, respectively, for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C and sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples (to be referred to as Y and Lu samples hereafter for brevity wherever convenient), respectively. The superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) value of YNi_{2}B_{2}C agrees well with the T_{c} values reported by others,[5, 4, 48, 52, 53] but T_{c} for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C is slightly smaller than that observed by others,[34, 35, 30, 54, 55, 36] The superconducting transition width for either sample is ~0.25 K which is quite sharp, indicating the good quality (homogeneity) of both samples. The good quality of these crystals is further confirmed by a reasonably high resistivity ratio RR, defined as, \rho(300)/\rho(T_{c},onset). i.e., RR(Y) = 18 and RR(Lu) = 25, where \rho(T_{c},onset) of the Y and Lu samples are 3.8 and 1.9 \mu\Omega cm, respectively. The lower RR value of the Y sample implies that the Y sample has more imperfections. The resistivity just above the superconducting transition temperature does not seem to become temperature independent for either sample, exhibiting a weak temperature dependence.

Based on the measured values of \rho(RT) and [_dp_/_dT_]RT of the Y and Lu samples in this work, and recently reported theoretical band-structure calculations,[27] estimates of the electron mean free path (_l_) and the transport electron-phonon coupling parameter (l_u_) are made for these materials.

The resistivity can be written as

\[\rho^{-1} = \frac{2}{3}\ e^{2}N(0)\nu_{F}l,\] (1)

where _N_(0) is the band quasiparticle density of states at the Fermi level and n_{F} is the Fermi velocity. The values of _N_(0) for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C and YNi_{2}B_{2}C have been calculated[27, 31] and are 4.8 and 4.03 states/(eV unit cell), respectively. The Fermi velocity n_{F} also has been calculated[27] to be 3.6 x 107 cm/s for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. No such estimate of n_{F} is available for YNi_{2}B_{2}C. Hence, n_{F} of YNi_{2}B_{2}C is assumed to be the same as that of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C since they have similar band structures. These numbers in Eq. (1) give _l_(Y) = 110 A and _l_(Lu) = 190 A at T = 16 K, and _l_(Y) = 6.1 A and _l_(Lu) = 7.6 A at 300 K. The electron mean free path l at room temperature in these samples is of the order of their atomic spacing, and therefore, the semiclassical Boltzmann theory may not be strictly valid to describe the transport phenomena at room and higher temperatures. In addition, possible anharmonicity and Fermi smearing effects at higher temperature may be responsible for producing some flattening of the resistivity near room temperature. Since _l_(Y) is smaller than _l_(Lu) at RT, the relatively larger flattening of the resistivity of YNi_{2}B_{2}C near

  room temperature in comparison with that of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C is understandable. The resistivity flattening effect is truly very small here, and therefore, linearity between \rho and T near RT is essentially valid in this range.

In the Bloch-Gruneisen transport theory the temperature dependence of \rho is related to the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm tr} by the relation [57]

\[\frac{d\rho}{dT}=\frac{8\,\pi^{2}}{\hbar\,\omega_{p}^{2}}\,k_{B}\lambda_{\rm tr},\] (2)

where \omega_{p} is the Drude plasma frequency which is related to N(0) through the relation

\[\hbar^{2}\,\omega_{p}^{2}=4\,\pi e^{2}N(0)\,\nu_{F}^{2}.\] (3)

Equation (2) assumes that residual resistivity and other contributions to \rho are negligibly small compared to the electron-phonon contribution described by the standard Boltzmann transport theory. Further, Eq. (2) is valid for T>0.7 \Theta_{D} where \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature [57]. The reported values of \Theta_{D} for YNi_{2}B_{2}C are 489 K (Ref. [52]) and 537 K [24], and \approx350 K for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C [40, 54]. The use of Eq. (2) to calculate \lambda_{\rm tr} from \rho (RT) and [d\rho/dT]_{\rm RT} values seems to be reasonable for sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, but it is only approximately correct for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C since RT (300 K)<0.7 \Theta_{D}(Y). The plasma frequency of each compound can be calculated using Eq. (3) which gives 5.1 eV for sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C and 4.7 eV for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C where r_{F}=3.6\times10^{7} cm/s is assumed for both samples, and N(0)=4.8 and 4.03 states/(eV unit cell) for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [27]) and YNi_{2}B_{2}C [31] respectively. A substitution of [d\rho({\rm Y})/dT]_{\rm RT}=0.22 \mud\Omega cm/K and [d\rho({\rm Lu})/dT]_{\rm RT}=0.15 \mu\Omega cm/K in Eq. (2) yields \lambda_{\rm tr}(Y)=1.2 and \lambda_{\rm tr}(Lu)=0.97 as listed in Table I. Another recent calculation [30] for Lu gives the value N(0)=3.88 states/(eV unit cell) which produces a smaller value for \lambda_{\rm tr}. These values seem reasonable and represent a semiempirical measure of electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda which appears in the McMillan equation for the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}[58]. With the knowledge of T_{c} and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} of a superconductor, \lambda can be estimated from the McMillan equation

\[k_{B}T_{c}=\frac{\hbar\,\omega_{\rm log}}{1.2}\,\exp\left[-\,\frac{1.04(1+ \lambda)}{\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda)}\right],\] (4)

where \omega_{\rm log} is taken to be 0.7 \omega_{\rm ph}, \omega_{\rm ph} is regarded to be same as the Debye frequency \omega_{D}=k_{B}\Theta_{D}/\hbar, and \mu^{*} is Coulomb pseudopotential and usually taken between 0.1 and 0.15. Values of \lambda determined from Eq. (4) with \mu^{*}=0.15 are given in Table I. Closer agreement with \lambda_{\rm tr} is found for \mu^{*}=0.15 for Y, but for Lu better agreement is found with \mu^{*}=0.10. It is not clear why this should be since the electronic and phonon structures of the two compounds should be very similar.

The electron phonon coupling parameter can also be estimated from the ratio of N(0)|_{\rm obs}/N(0)|_{\rm band}=\gamma|_{\rm obs}/\gamma|_{\rm band}=(1+ \lambda_{\gamma}), where \gamma is the specific-heat constant and \lambda_{\gamma} is the electron-phonon mass enhancement parameter which should be similar to \lambda. Movshovich _et al._[52] reported \gamma_{\rm obs}=18.7 mJ/(mol K^{2}) for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C, and the calculated value [31] of \gamma_{\rm band} for YNi_{2}B_{2}C is 9.5 mJ/(mol K^{2}) with N(0)\approx4.03 states/(eV unit cell). Similarly, \gamma_{\rm obs} LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [40])=19 mJ/(mol K^{2}) and calculated \gamma_{\rm band}=11.3 mJ/(mol K^{2}) using N(0)=4.8 states/(eV unit cell). The calculated value N(0)=3.88 states/(eV unit cell) for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [30]) gives \gamma_{\rm band}=9.15 mJ/(mol K^{2}). The corresponding values of \lambda_{\gamma} are listed in Table I. There appears to be a particularly wide spread in the various estimates for Lu, but values for Y are reasonably consistent. A 10-15 % disagreement among the electron-phonon coupling parameters obtained from different procedures is commonly found in other superconductors [57]. In any case, the range of \lambda_{\rm tr} or \lambda values are such that these compounds would be considered to be only moderately strong-coupling superconductors. A comparison of these compounds with some A-15 superconductors which have T_{c} near 15 K, i.e., Nb_{3}Sn (T_{c}\approx17 K), V_{3}Si (T_{c}\approx15 K) shows that \lambda values for Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C superconductors are close to that of V_{3}Si (\lambda\approx1.0) but much smaller than that of Nb_{3}Sn (\lambda\approx1.8) or Nb_{3}Al (\lambda\approx1.5). [57]. Strong-coupling elemental superconductors Pb and Nb have \lambda\approx1.2. [57]

A similarity between Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C and A-15 high-T_{c} superconductors is also found in the temperature dependence of their resistivities at low temperatures, i.e., 1.25T_{c}<T<0.1\Theta_{D}. Below 100 K, the resistivity of either borocarbide compound shows a nonlinearity with temperature and it does not decrease as rapidly as expected from the Bloch-Gruneisen theory. To determine the exact temperature dependence of \rho(T), the low-temperature data was fitted to the expression

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{p}\] (5)

in the temperature interval 1.25T_{c}<T<0.1\Theta_{D} using a least-squares fit procedure, with the square of the correlation coefficient to determine the goodness of the fit. The temperature region above 20 K was chosen to minimize the superconducting fluctuation effects. Figure 2 shows the plot of \rho vs T^{2.2} for the Y sample. The in-plane \rho_{0}, A, and p parameters obtained from the fit are 3.38 \mu\Omega cm, 8.1\times10^{-4}\mu\Omega cm/K^{p}, and 2.2 for the sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C, and 1.36 \mu\Omega cm, 1.8\times10^{-3}\mu\Omega cm/K^{p}, and 2.0 for the sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. Thus, the low-temperature in plane resistivity of these metallic sc-Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C compounds seems to be anomalous in the temperature region 1.25T_{c}<T<0.1\Theta_{D} in a sense that its temperature dependence is different from the T^{5} or T^{3} dependence expected from the conventional theory and usually

  observed for ordinary and transition metals. The exponent p, which is approximately equal to 2 for either of these borocarbide compounds, is similar to the one found [7, 59] for \rho(T) of disordered superconducting high-T_{c}A-15 compounds (Nb_{3}Sn, Nb_{3}Al, Nb_{3}Ge, V_{3}Si, etc.), i.e., p = 2. The value of A is smaller for the Y sample than for the Lu sample as expected from the resistivity values. The T^{2} behavior of p in A-15 compounds was initially suggested by Webb _et al._[60] to be due to a non-Debye phonon spectrum _F_(_o_) which was later discounted by Gurvitch [61] through a careful analysis of \rho(T) data on disordered A-15 compounds. The possibility that the electron-electron interaction gives the T^{2} dependence of \rho(T) can be ruled out since the coefficient A is about two to three orders of magnitude larger than expected from this scattering mechanism [59, 60, 62]. The T^{2} behavior is also observed in magnetic or nearly magnetic metals. It is possible that scattering from reported antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the Ni sites [35, 36], could contribute to this temperature dependence, but other experiments [21, 34] do not confirm these reports. Gurvitch [63] has proposed that strong electron-phonon coupling is the necessary condition for observing \rho_{\rm e-ph}\alpha T^{2} in A-15 compounds, but it is not sufficient; the simultaneous presence of strong coupling and high disorder are required to produce the temperature exponent p equal to 2.0. A high disorder results in the breakdown of the electron-phonon momentum conservation law **k**\pm\bar{q}=**k^{\prime}** and may be responsible for the T^{2} behavior of p in the A-15's. R Ni_{2}B_{2}C (_R_ = Y,Lu) have l values similar to those of some of A-15 compounds, but the samples investigated here are single crystals, and therefore do not have large disorder. Therefore the possibility of the breakdown of the electron-phonon momentum conservation law does not arise. The present result \rho(T)\alpha T^{2} for sc-Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C at low temperatures must be due to some other mechanism(s). Recent photoemission studies [32] on YNi_{2}B_{2}C indicate that the Ni 3_d_-derived conduction bands are narrower than the calculated ones, and are accompanied by a satellite. These results are indicative of the presence of electron-electron correlation effects. Such effects, as well as some other unidentified scattering mechanisms, may be responsible for the quadratic temperature dependence at low temperatures.

While no measurements on the _c_-axis electrical resistivity of any borocarbide superconductors _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C have been reported as yet, Sera _et al._[47] have recently reported in-plane and the _c_-axis thermal conductivity measurements on _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C (_R_ = Y,Ho). They find little anisotropy between the c and a axes at low temperatures. Assuming that the Wiedemann-Franz law is valid for these superconductors, it means that there will be little anisotropy between the in-plane and _c_-axis resistivities, unlike in high-temperature superconductors, although these borocarbide superconductors also have a layered structure.

Figure 3 shows the dependence of in-plane resistance of YNi_{2}B_{2}C at 25 K as a function of magnetic field (parallel to the c axis) up to 4.5 T. The change in the resistance at 4.5 T is about 6.5% which is quite large in comparison with normal metals [64]. Figure 3 clearly shows that the resistance varies nearly as H^{2} for low field values, and seems to become linear with H at higher magnetic fields. A fit to data to R(T,H) = R(T,0) + R1 * H + R2 * H^{2} shows that R 1/_R_ 2 * 10 indicating that there is a substantial contribution from the linear term in addition to the quadratic term. A fit to the power law [_R_(_T_,_H_) - R(T,0)]/_R_(_T_,0) = AH^{*} gives n = 1.27 indicating that the magnetic-field dependence of the magnetoresistance is closer to linear than quadratic in H. This fit is shown as an inset in Fig. 3. At lower temperature, i.e., T = 15 K, we find [_R_(_T_,4.5T_) - R(T,0)]/_R_(_T_,0) = 7.5% and 8.0% for H parallel and perpendicular to the c axis indicating a small anisotropy in the magnetoresistance. A similar amount of magnetoresistance has been observed in a YNi_{2}B_{2}C polycrystalline sample [65]. Magnetoresistance of the order of 40% at 8 T (with magnetic field perpendicular to the current) has been reported [55] in polycrystalline LuNi_{2}B_{2}C with estimated electron mean free path l = 700 A. It is difficult to explain such a large electron mean free path in a polycrystalline sample compared to the value of about 200 A in our single-crystal sample of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. In contrast, we find a magnitude (\Delta R/_R_ * 7.3% for H = 45 kOe at 20 K) and field dependence for sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C very similar to that shown in Fig. 3. Perhaps the grain boundaries in the polycrystalline sample in Ref. [55] consist of a different compound with very unusual properties.

When a magnetic field is applied, the resulting electron orbits may be closed or open depending upon the topology of the Fermi surface. The transverse magnetoresistance saturates for closed orbits but grows indefinitely as H^{2} for open orbits [64, 66, 67]. A linear magnetoresistance at high fields has been observed for single crystals as well as polycrystalline materials [68, 69, 70, 71]. While there is hardly any good understanding of the linear magnetoresistance, it has been shown theoretically to occur in polycrystals with open orbits [66, 72] due to thickness variation [73], or also if the carrier transport takes place along two-dimensional skipping-orbit states [74]. Most recently Park and Kim [75] have shown that the interference of two open orbits modeled by two cylindrical Fermi surfaces gives rise to a linear transverse magnetoresistance when the magnetic field is slightly tilted from the direction perpendicular to the plane defined by the cylinder axes. Kim, Hwang, and Ihm [30] show that there are five electronic complex Fermi surfaces of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, one of which is a cylindrical surface perpendicular to the c axis. Thus, the open electron orbits are expected in LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (and YNi_{2}B_{2}C due to similarity between their band structures) which may lead to the linear magnetoresistance as predicted by Park and Kim and observed by us at high fields. A more careful study of

  magnetoresistance in these compounds is needed for a better understanding of the phenomenon.

### Thermopower

The absolute thermopower, S(T), measured with temperature gradient along the _ab_ plane of the single crystals of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, is shown in Fig. 4 as a function of temperature. S(T) is negative for both the samples from RT to just above the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} where it rapidly drops to zero within the measurement accuracy. The superconducting transition temperatures determined this way are within \pm0.25 K of that determined by the resistivity measurements. The sharp fall of S to zero at T_{c} also confirms the good quality of the samples. The negative thermopower does not necessarily mean that the charge carriers in these compounds are electrons; [76] however, the band-structure calculations [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] indicate so. Hall effect measurements are needed to ascertain the nature of charge carriers. The thermopower of both samples is seen to be linear in T near room temperature within the measurement accuracy. Room-temperature thermopower S(RT) and [dS/dT]_{\rm RT} are -8.1 \muV/K and -11.5 nV/K^{2}, and -7.3 \muV/K and -10.4 nV/K^{2} for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples, respectively, which are nearly the same for both samples. The magnitude of S(RT), reported here, is somewhat larger than the typical value associated with free electron/conventional metals, i.e., -1.28 \muV/K for lead and 1.94 \muV/K for gold, but it is approximately the same as for palladium [76] [S(RT)=-10 \muV/K] and many high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors. [77]

The thermopower of conventional nonmagnetic metals consists of two contributions, a diffusion contribution and a phonon-drag contribution resulting from the transfer of phonon momentum to the electron gas. The diffusion contribution is proportional to temperature, while the phonon-drag contribution falls at low temperature as the phonons freeze out, and at high temperatures as the excess phonon momentum gets limited by phonon-phonon scattering. This usually results in a phonon-drag peak in conventional metals with T^{3} dependence below 0.1\Theta_{D} and falls as T^{-1} above \approx0.3\Theta_{D}. Figure 4 clearly shows that there are no structures (peak, etc.) in S vs T data from RT down to T_{c}, i.e., no obvious phonon-drag peak is present which one would expect, [76] if present, in the temperature region 0.1\Theta_{D}<T<0.3\Theta_{D}. Since these samples are single crystals and have reasonably high resistivity ratios one would have expected some signature of a phonon-drag peak in the data. However, the usual signature is totally absent, and S is similar to that in amorphous metals [78, 79] and, except for sign, many high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors. [77]

It is obvious from the thermopower data that in addition to the diffusion thermopower, which is proportional to the temperature, there is(are) additional contribution(s) to the thermopower yielding the observed temperature dependence of S. Figure 5 shows data (S-bT) vs T for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals, where b is the coefficient obtained by fitting the S vs T data to a straight line, i.e., S(T)=a+bT, in the linear region (T\approx100 K to RT). (S-bT) represents contributions to the thermopower other than the diffusion thermopower, and as observed from Fig. 5, this contribution is negative and almost constant between 100 and 300 K for both samples; approximately -4.3 \muV/K for the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C sample and -4.8 \muV/K for the YNi_{2}B_{2}C sample. Below 100 K, this contribution to the thermopower for each sample varies approximately as T^{-1}, until the superconducting transition temperature at which it rises abruptly to zero. Generally, the most important contribution to the thermopower of a metal, in addition to the diffusion thermopower, is the phonon-drag contribution. Any contribution from possible magnetic impurities is expected to be much smaller than that observed in Fig. 5. Recently, Trodahl [80] tried to explain the thermopower of high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors by including the phonon-drag contribution with the assumption that the phonon-phonon scattering in high-T_{c} cuprates remains weaker than phonon-electron scattering even at room temperature. He finds that the temperature dependence of the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower of high-T_{c} cuprates is very similar to that shown for S-bT in Fig. 5, i.e., it is almost temperature independent between 100 K and RT, and this constant value represents

Figure 3: Field dependence of the transverse magnetoresistance, \Delta R/R(0,25 K)=[R(H,25 K)-R(0,25 K)]R(0,25 K) for YNi_{2}B_{2}C with magnetic field parallel to the c axis. The inset shows the variation of the magnetoresistance with H^{1,27}.

  the saturation value of the phonon-drag thermopower. This kind of temperature dependence of the phonon-drag thermopower leads to a simple shift of the linear diffusion thermopower between 100 K and RT. This particular behavior relates to the layered nature of high-T_{c} cuprates. Borocarbides are also layered compounds; hence a similar phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower may not be unreasonable. Therefore, assuming that Fig. 5 represents the phonon-drag contribution to the total thermopower the saturation value of this contribution in sc-Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C is estimated to be \approx-4.5\muV/K.

The extrapolation of the data of Fig. 4 near room temperature, assuming a linear T dependence of S, does not pass through S = 0 at T = 0, and gives intercepts of - 4.61 and - 4.34\muV/K, respectively, for the Y and Lu samples. This result implies that, in the absence of superconductivity, there would be a low temperature "knee" in S(T), similar to that produced by electron-phonon renormalization.[81] This "knee" seems to be present near 70 K for Y and 100 K for Lu samples. Electron-phonon renormalization would lead to an enhanced thermopower that is given by

\[S = S_{b}[1 + \lambda(T)],\]

where \lambda(T) is the electron-phonon mass enhancement parameter and S_{b} is the bare thermopower (without renormalization effects). In this expression certain corrections[82] have been assumed small and therefore neglected. Equation (6) can be rewritten as

\[\frac{S}{T} = \frac{S_{b}}{T}\left[ {1 + \lambda(T)} \right].\]

A plot of S/T vs T should then give a measure of \lambda(T), and \left[ {S/T} \right]_{T = 0}/\left[ {S/T} \right]_{\rm RT} should approximate 1 + \lambda(0).[79] Assuming that the S/T value just above T_{c} is \left[ {S/T} \right]_{T = 0} as an approximation, we find that \lambda(0) > 5 - 6 which is absurdly high when compared to the estimated values of \lambda(0) for Y (Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C by others[26, 27, 30, 31] or to those obtained here or to the values observed for even very strong-coupling superconductors[57] (viz. Pb-Bi alloys). It may be mentioned that a recent \muSR study[83] on YNi_{2}B_{2}C reports a mass-enhancement factor of 9.4 from penetration depth measurements. Recently Kaiser and Mountioy[84] have explained the thermopower of high-T_{c} superconductors within the existing metallic diffusion-thermopower theory in terms of an anomalously large strong electron-phonon coupling (greater than 5), such as might arise from an anharmonic double-well potential[85] in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \phi} It has been recently reported[86] that the electron-phonon coupling \lambda for a double-well potential could reach huge values, 5 - 50 or more. Whether large and anisotropic thermal vibrations of carbon atoms in the Y-C plane in YNi_{2}B_{2}C, as observed by Godart _et al._,[38] would lead to such a situation should be studied theoretically.

In the presence of spin fluctuations, Eq. (7) is modified to

\[\frac{S}{T} = \frac{S_{b}}{T}\left[ {1 + \lambda(T) + \lambda_{\rm sf}} \right\rbrack,\]

where \lambda_{\rm sf} is the mass-enhancement parameter due to spin fluctuations. Kohara _et al._ and others[35] have reported the presence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in polycrystalline YNi_{2}B_{2}C but a NMR study of single-crystal YNi_{2}B_{2}C by Suh _et al.[34]_ shows no antiferromagnetic correlations. Even if such fluctuations were present, one would not expect \lambda_{\rm sf} to have large values which could explain \left[ {S/T} \right]_{T = 0}/\left[ {S/T} \right]_{\rm RT} = 5 - 7.

Lee _et al.[46]_ have reported S(T) for polycrystalline YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. They find S(RT) values to be - 5.1 and - 4.7\muV/K for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C polycrystalline samples, respectively. These are almost two-thirds of the values reported here for the single-crystal samples. [dS/dT] is almost zero in their work in the temperature interval 150 K < T<RT. Thus, the present results on YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals are in disagreement, except for the sign of the thermopower, with those on polycrystalline Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C. However, the single-crystal measurements are taken with \Delta T along the ab plane. Polycrystalline samples would give an average of the thermopower along the ab plane and the c axis, appropriately weighted for the conductivities in those directions.[76] Since no measurement of thermopower is available along the c axis of these crystals, it is not possible to comment on it quantitatively. If this is the reason for the difference between S for single crystals and polycrystalline samples, the polycrystalline results indicate a possibility of a positive thermopower along the c axis of Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C single crystals. Lee _et al.[46]_ have suggested that the nonlinear behavior of the thermopower of Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C polycrystalline samples may be due to the mixed-valence phenomenon like that found in CeNi_{x},[87] and they found a good fit to the expression S' = S - bT = \Delta T/(B^{2} + T^{2}), where b, A, and B are constants. The data for single crystals presented here could not be well described by such a fit, and there is no reason to expect temperature-dependent valence fluctuations in these compounds. Possibly the difference may be attributed to a strikingly different behavior between the

The coefficient b is the slope of the straight line obtained by least-squares fitting of the data in the linear region (between 100 K and RT).

### Superconductivity

The superconducting transition temperatures of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal samples are found to be 15.6 and 16.1 K, respectively, from the resistive transition measurements where T_{c} is defined as the intersection of the line drawn through the steepest part of the transition curve with the temperature axis. In order to determine the upper critical field H_{c2}(T), resistance of the samples has been measured as a function of temperature in various fixed values of magnetic fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the c axis of both samples. Figure 6 shows the results for YNi_{2}B_{2}C sample with the applied magnetic field perpendicular to the c axis which clearly shows that the magnetic field _basically_ shifts the resistive transition curve without affecting the transition width significantly at lower magnetic fields (H<50 kOe), i.e., the effect of H is only to decrease T_{c} of the sample. The large positive magnetoresistance can also be seen in this figure. Similar behavior of the resistive superconducting transition is observed for a magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and for both field directions with LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. Magnetization measurements, i.e., M vs T for single-crystal YNi_{2}B_{2}C also show similar behavior for different applied magnetic fields.[8, 48] This behavior of the superconducting transition in an applied magnetic field is in contrast with the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors in which the transition width increases even in presence of a small external magnetic field, and where it increases enormously as the applied magnetic field is increased, leading to extensive tailing effects as R approaches zero.[88] In such a case it becomes difficult to define H_{c2}(T); however, the sharp transition curves for sc-Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C samples investigated here permit determination of H_{c2}(T) unambiguously.

T_{c}(H) is determined from the intersection of the straight line drawn through the steep superconducting transition region and the T axis which is then converted into H_{c2}(T) for each sample. We shall refer to H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) as the upper critical fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis of the crystal. Figures 7 and 8 show H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) vs T for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C and sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples. The current was 50 mA (current density\approx26 A/cm^{2}) for the Y sample, and 10 mA (\approx3 A/cm^{2}) for the Lu sample in the ab plane of each. From the figures we note that the upper critical fields H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) of the Y sample show almost no anisotropy, while those of the Lu sample show a small anisotropy, i.e., [H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T)]_{\rm Lu} is larger than [H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T)]_{\rm Lu} and the difference becomes larger at lower temperatures. [H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T)]_{\rm Lu} is \approx15% higher than [H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T)]_{\rm Lu} at T\approx4.5 K. Absence of the anisotropy of H_{c2}(T) of sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C determined from the resistive transition in a magnetic field agrees well with reports based on magnetization measurements.[8, 48] This observation is in contrast to the strong anisotropy seen in H_{c2}(T) between in-plane and c-axis-aligned fields in cuprate high-T_{c} superconductors[88] which also have a layered structure.

It has been previously reported[14] that H_{c2}(T) for HoNi_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal samples is strongly current dependent, especially in the range of fields and temperature where reentrant superconductivity is observed. To determine if such a dependence exists for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C samples, H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) were obtained from the resistive transition curves recorded using two different current densities, i.e., 2.6 and 26 A/cm^{2}, along the ab plane which are shown in Fig. 9. A small current dependence is clearly observed becoming larger at lower temperatures; H_{c2}(T) differs by \approx10% at the lowest temperature (\approx4.5 K) for the two current densities. It should be noted, however, that the anisotropy between H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T), for a given current density, does not alter, and the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(H= 0) is _exactly_ the same for the two current densities. A similar current density dependence was observed with LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples. The observed current density dependence of H_{c2}(T) for these samples remains unexplained and is definitely not due to a heating effect, as pointed out earlier.[14]

Figure 7: Temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2} for the YNi_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal sample with magnetic field parallel (open circles) and perpendicular (\times) to the c axis. The current density was \approx26 A/cm^{2} and was along the ab plane. Data deduced from magnetization measurements (Ref. 8) with field normal to the c axis (crosses) are shown for comparison.

  H_{c2}(T) vs T data in Figs. 7 and 8 show that H_{c2}(T) does not intersect the T axis _linearly_ but bends towards the higher T side giving a positive curvature to the H_{c2}(T) curve, i.e., d^{2}H_{c2}/dT^{2}>0. Please note that determination of H_{c2}(T) from magnetization measurements [8] on single-crystal YNi_{2}B_{2}C are in excellent agreement with those from resistance measurements as shown in Fig. 7. A similar positive curvature in H_{c2}(T)|_{T-T_{c}} has been reported in polycrystall-line and single-crystal RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds [8, 14, 54, 55, 89, 90], dichalcogenides [91], amorphous superconductors [92], A-15 superconducting compounds [7], Ba-doped C_{60}[93], and in high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors [94]. The Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki, (WHHM) theory [95, 96], which takes into account the orbital and paramagnetic effects of an external field as well as nonmagnetic and spin-orbit scatterings, is normally used to explain H_{c2}(T) of superconducting alloys (type-II superconductors). The WHHM theory predicts a linear temperature dependence of H_{c2}(T) near T_{c}, i.e., H_{c2}(T)\propto(1 - T/T_{c}), in either the "clean" or the "dirty" limit. This theory thus fails to explain the positive curvature of H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} as observed in a large number of superconducting systems. Several explanations have been advanced to explain this behavior of H_{c2}(T). Some of these are: (1) scattering by magnetic impurities [97], (2) reduced dimensionality and disorder [98, 99], (3) strong electron-phonon coupling effects [100], (4) bipolaron effect [101, 102] and (5) two-component response [90] in granular polycrystalline superconductors (intra- and intergranular effects). In the case of high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, H_{c2}(T) is found to vary as (1 - T/T_{c}) [32] near T_{c} if H_{c2} is derived from the resistance measurements or as (1 - T/T_{c}) if it is derived from magnetization measurements [88]. In high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors this peculiar temperature dependence of H_{c2} near T_{c} has been attributed to the flux flow in R(T,H) measurements as evidenced by long resistive tails in the transition region, and to the twin boundaries limiting the spatial extent of the vortices in one direction [88]. Neither of these possible causes are present in Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal samples; yet a positive curvature is observed in H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} regardless of whether the applied magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular to the c axis. Reduced dimensionality and disorder cannot be applicable to either of the two samples investigated here since they behave like three-dimensional metals [26, 27], and they are single crystals with relatively low resistivities, excluding a high degree of disorder. Two-component response [90] may be applicable to the granular polycrystalline samples but not to single-crystal RNi_{2}B_{2}C samples. There seems to be no evidence of applicability of the bipolaron model to RNi_{2}B_{2}C superconductors, moreover in this model [101]H_{c2}(0) goes to infinity unless limited by some additional effects like localization of bosons. The presence of a small amount of magnetic impurities is certainly a possibility but unless these are present in large quantities, H_{c2}(T) is not expected to be affected substantially [88]. A possibility of distributed T_{c} in a given sample does not arise here as the samples are single crystals, and the resistive transitions are quite sharp.

The positive curvature in H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} makes it difficult to apply the standard WHHM theory and its extensions to obtain certain characteristic parameters in the superconducting state of Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C single crystals. However, this theory seems to be the only one which would give certain characteristic superconducting parameters. To apply the theory, the H_{c2}(T) vs T data is divided into two sections: (a) the lower temperature data which fits to a straight line yielding T_{ca} which turns out to be lower than the observed T_{c} (T_{ca} is determined by the intersection of this line with the T axis.); (b) The region near T_{c} which shows the positive curvature. Figures 7 and 8 show that the low-temperature data almost lie on a straight line. As a matter of fact one would not expect from the WHHM theory the H_{c2}(T) data to lie on a straight line at such low temperatures (T/T_{c}<0.7). To obtain [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T-T_{c}}, the low-temperature H_{c2}(T) data between T= 0.85T_{c} and 0.25T_{c} is fitted to a straight line. The goodness of the fit is measured by the square of the correlation coefficient (r^{2}>0.997). The slope obtained is not [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T-T_{c}} but [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T-T_{ca}}. This slope is then used to calculate the upper critical field H_{c2}(0), the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi(0) and/or the BCS coherence length \xi(0), the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(0)

Circles and triangles represent data with magnetic field perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the c axis. Open and filled circles/triangles are for 50 mA (\approx26 A/cm^{2}) and 5 mA (\approx2.6 A/cm^{2}) current through the sample, respectively.

  with the knowledge of experimentally determined _H__c_1, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter _k_(0), the magnetic-field penetration depth _k_(0), and the specific-heat constant g, since all of these can be expressed in terms of [_dH__c_2/_dT_]_T_7-_T_c_ and/or the parameters derived from it. However, the exact relationship between these parameters and [_dH__c_2/_dT_]_T_7-_T_c_ depends upon whether the sample is "clean" (_I_b_<=60NS) or "dirty" (_l_<=_k_0BCS). The electron mean free path l has already been estimated for both the samples by the resistivity measurements. The BCS coherence length k0BCS can be determined from the BCS relation:

\[\xi_{0{\text{BCS}}}^{\Delta} = \frac{\hbar v_{F}}{\pi\Delta_{o}},\]

where D_o_ is the energy gap at T = 0 K, and the D superscript on k0BCS indicates that it has been determined using the above relation. Recent break junction tunneling measurements [9] on polycrystalline YNi2B2C show that the energy gap of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C obeys the BCS relation

\[2\Delta_{o} \approx (3.5 \pm 0.1)k_{B}T_{C},\]

suggesting that these are BCS-type weak-coupling superconductors. Equation (9) gives \xi_{0{\text{BCS}}}^{\Delta} = 321 A for YNi2B2C and 311 A for LuNi2B2C where v_{F} = 3.6 x 107 cm/s is taken from the band-structure calculations.27 For both of these compounds, the electron mean free path l is smaller than \xi_{0{\text{BCS}}}^{\Delta}, i.e., [_l_/_k_0BCS] is approximately equal to 0.34 for YNi2B2C and 0.61 for LuNi2B2C. These ratios indicate that the Y and Lu single-crystal samples may be considered as "'quasi-sidirty." Thus, various standard formulas [95, 103, 104] valid for the "dirty" limit are used in the analysis:

\[H_{c2}(0) = 0.693T_{c}\left[ { - \frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}} \right]_{T = T_{c}},\]

where (\xi_{0}^{H_{c2}})^{*} = \xi_{0}^{H_{c2}}/(1 + \lambda), and superscript H_{c2} means that the coherence length is determined from [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T = T_{ca}}, \lambda is the electron-phonon coupling parameter, \gamma is in ergs/(cm^{3} K^{2}) and \rho_{o} is in \Omega cm. With l = l_{u} determined earlier from the resistivity just above T_{c}, and \lambda = \lambda_{uq}, for YNi_{2}B_{2}C \gamma = \gammael^{2}=22.8 mJ/(mol K^{2}), and for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, \gammael^{2}=18.2 mJ/(mol K^{2}) and \gammap^{2}=18.6 mJ/(mol K^{2}). These values agree very well with those reported recently, i.e., 18.7 mJ/(mol K^{2}) for YNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [52]) and 19 mJ/(mol K^{2}) for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C.[40]

While we have used H_{c2}(T) data well below T_{c} to get [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T = T_{ca}}, the positive curvature in H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} has not been explained. Recently Bahcall[107] has shown that solving the BCS-Gor'kov theory near H_{c2}(T) directly by generalizing pairing between plane waves to pairing between many electronic Landau levels leads to significant deviations from the semiclassical theory for clean and isotropic superconductors. This approach lowers the value of the upper critical field and causes H_{c2}(T) to vanish quadratically near T_{c} leading to a positive curvature, i.e., d^{2}H_{c2}/dT^{2}>0 near T_{c} , and indicates that a type-II superconductor converts to type I near T_{c} . Bahcall has given the following equation which describes the temperature dependence of H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} :

\[1.61e^{- 1/g}\sqrt{h} + 0.727h - (1 - t) = 0,\]

where h = H_{c2}^{B}(T)/H_{c2}^{S}(0), H_{c2}^{B}(T) refers to the calculated H_{c2}(T) from Bahcall's theory, H_{c2}^{S}(0) is the upper critical field at T= 0 K in the semiclassical theory, g = V_{\beta}N(0) is the BCS coupling constant, and t = T/T_{c} . In the limit g \rightarrow 0, the semiclassical result, H_{c2}^{S}(0) = H_{c2}(0) = - 0.727T_{c}[dH_{c2}/ dT]_{T = T_{c}} , is obtained (for clean type-II superconductors). For nonzero values of g, the presence of the \sqrt{h} term makes H_{c2}(T) vanish quadratically near T_{c} , not linearly as in the WHHM theory. This theory leads to a smaller value of H_{c2}(0) for nonzero g values, i.e., g = 0.4 leads to an \sim25% reduction in H_{c2}(0) obtained from the semiclassical (WHHM) theory. Equation (17) provides a good fit to the H_{c2}(T) data between T_{c} and T = 0.75T_{c} for both Y and Lu samples. The fit is better for the Lu sample than for the Y sample. Figure 10 shows the fit for H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) of the Lu sample, and a similarly good fit is obtained for H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) of the Lu sample with g^{\rm pl}=0.40 and g^{\rm pr}=0.38, respectively. The g values for the Y sample are g^{\rm pl}=0.58 and g^{\rm pr}=0.57. The g values suggest that YNi_{2}B_{2}C is a stronger coupling superconductor than LuNi_{2}B_{2}C which is also reflected in the higher value of \lambda_{\rm tr} for YNi_{2}B_{2}C than for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. Bahcall finds g = 0.3 gives a good fit between H_{c2}(T) for Nb_{3}Sn (Ref. [7]) and Eq. (17) near T_{c} . It may be noted that the g value for lead, which is a strong-coupling superconductor, is \sim0.4.[103] Thus, the obtained values of g for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C place them in the strong-coupling superconductor category.

Neither this theory nor the WHHM theory adequately describes the low-temperature behavior of H_{c2}(T) for either of the samples as shown in Fig. 11. Although Bahcall's theory can be fit well to the high-temperature data where the positive curvature is seen, it predicts much too low a value for H_{c2}(T) at lower temperatures. It is difficult to compare the H_{c2}(T) data with the WHHM theory because of the positive curvature it shows near T_{c} , but, if the linear region of the H_{c2}(T) data is extrapolated to T_{ca} and that slope used with the WHHM theory with T_{c} = T_{ca} , the resulting curve does not describe the lower temperature data as shown in Fig. 11. The figure clearly shows that the data lie on a straight line for T< 0.8T_{c} with no indication of deviation from linear behavior down to 0.3T_{c} . Thus, the WHHM theory does not seem to be valid for these samples, even at lower temperatures, i.e., the straight line behavior of the data extends far beyond the region predicted by the WHHM theory. Lower temperature measurements should be made to determine the

[107]) with g=0.4 is represented by the dotted curve. The solid curve is the prediction of the WHHM theory in the âdirtyâ limit.

  extent of the breakdown of theory. Since Bahcall's theory[107] predicts a lower value of H_{c2}(0) than does WHHM (about 23% lower for g\approx0.4) it gives even a worse description at low temperatures. Thus, the theoretical ideas need to be modified in order to explain the experimental H_{c2}(T) results reported here for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals as well as those reported in the literature for other RNi_{2}B_{2}C superconducting compounds.

## Summary and conclusions

Measurements of the in-plane resistivity, in-plane thermopower, and upper critical field H_{c2}(T) for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals are reported. The in-plane resistivities for both samples vary approximately linearly at room temperature and follow a power law T^{p} at low temperatures with p =2.2 and 2.0, respectively, for the Y and Lu samples for 1.25T_{c} < T< 0.16\Theta_{D} , similar to that followed by the strong-coupling and disordered A-15 compounds. The analysis of the resistivity data shows that these are moderately strong-coupling superconductors with the electron-phonon parameter \lambda_{u}=1.2 and 0.97 for the Y and Lu samples, respectively. These values agree within 10-15 % with the values obtained from the analysis of the specific-heat and superconducting transition temperature data. The Y sample shows a large and positive transverse magnetoresistance, and is about 8% (H=45 kOe) at 15 K. That for the Lu sample is comparable (about 7% at 20 K), not near the 40% value reported for a polycrystalline sample.[55] A very small anisotropy (\approx2%) is observed with respect to the direction of H parallel and perpendicular to the c axis of the crystal.

The absolute thermopower (S) as well as the slope \left(dS/dT\right)_{\rm RT} of both samples are negative from RT to T_{c} and their magnitudes are approximately the same. S varies approximately linearly near RT and an extrapolation to T=0 gives large intercepts (\approx -4 \muV/K) suggesting that in the absence of superconductivity there would be a low-temperature "knee" in S(T) similar to that produced by electron-phonon renormalization. The ratio of the highest value of S/T at low temperatures to that at RT indicates the possibility of a large value of the electron-phonon parameter \lambda(0), 6-8, which does not agree with the values of \lambda(0) estimated from other experimental measurements. The usual phonon-drag peak shape is not observed, but a large contribution beyond the diffusion term exists. The temperature dependence of this contribution is similar to the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower calculated for high-temperature superconductors (layered compounds) by Trodahl.[86]

The resistive transition curves in external magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the c axis have been used to determine the upper critical field H_{c2}(T). A small current dependence of H_{c2}(T) has been observed in the samples which becomes larger at lower temperatures. H_{c2}(T) for both samples shows a positive curvature near T_{c} which is not predicted by the WHHM theory. Various characteristic superconducting parameters have been calculated using the slope of H_{c2}(T) vs T in the temperature region T< 0.85T_{c} . The upper critical field H_{c2}(0) is typically 65 kOe, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \approx70 A, the BCS coherence length and the penetration depth \lambda(0) are \approx65 and \approx1200 A for YNi_{2}B_{2}C, and \approx35 and \approx800 A for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, respectively. These numbers show that both samples are type-II superconductors. A severe disagreement between the BCS coherence lengths obtained from the measurement of the energy gap[9] and from H_{c2}(T) measurements is found which can be only somewhat improved if one takes into account the renormalization of the Fermi velocity. H_{c2}(T) for the Y sample does not show any anisotropy with respect to the c axis in agreement with the magnetization measurements,[8] while the Lu sample shows an anisotropy in H_{c2}(T) of about \approx10%. The positive curvature of H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} can be explained in terms of a recent theoretical idea of Bahcall[107] who has calculated H_{c2}(T) directly by generalizing pairing between plane waves to pairing between many electronic Landau levels in presence of a magnetic field within the framework of the BCS-Gor'kov theory. A fit between the experimental data near T_{c} and the theoretical expression given by Bahcall gives the BCS coupling constant V_{\omega}N(0)\approx0.4 for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C and \approx0.6 for YNi_{2}B_{2}C. These values place both samples in the category of strong-coupling superconductors. On the other hand, the low-temperature behavior (down to 4.2 K) of H_{c2}(T) for both samples cannot be explained by either the WHHM or Bahcall's theory. H_{c2}(T) at low temperature greatly exceeds that expected from the slope of the region linear in temperature and presents an interesting challenge to the theory.

###### Abstract

The in-plane resistivity, in-plane absolute thermopower, and upper critical field measurements are reported for single-crystal samples of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C superconductors. The in-plane resistivity shows metallic behavior and varies approximately linearly with temperature near room temperature (RT) but shows nearly quadratic behavior in temperature at low temperatures. The YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C single-crystal samples exhibit large transverse magnetoresistance (\approx 6 - 8 % at 45 kOe) in the _ab_ plane. The absolute thermopower _S_(_T_) is negative from RT to the superconducting transition temperature _T_c . Its magnitude at RT is a few times of the value for apical good metal. _S_(_T_) is approximately linear in temperature between ~150 K and RT. Extrapolation to T = 0 gives large intercepts (few _Î¼_/K) for both samples suggesting the presence of a much larger "knee" than would be expected from electron-phonon interaction renormalization effects. The upper critical fields for H parallel and perpendicular to the c axis and the superconducting parameters derived from it do not show any anisotropy for the YNi2B2C single-crystal samples in agreement with magnetization and torque magnetometry measurements, but a small anisotropy is observed for the LuNi2B2C single crystals. The analysis shows that these are moderately strong-coupling type-II superconductors (similar to the A - 15 compounds) with a value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter _l_(0) approximately equal to 1.2 for YNi2B2C and 1.0 for LuNi2B2C, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length _l_(0) approximately equal to 70 A, and _H__c_2(0) ~ 60 - 70 kOe. The temperature dependence of the upper critical field shows a positive curvature near _T_c in disagreement with the Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki (WHHM) theory but in agreement with a recent solution of the Gor'kov equation using a basis formed by Landau levels (Bahcall); however, the data show a severe disagreement between the observed low-temperature behavior of _H__c_2(_T_) and that predicted either by WHHM or Bahcall's expressions.

## Introduction

The latest discovery of superconductivity in intermetallic borocarbide compounds, namely, YNi2B2C (Refs. 1 and 2) (T_{c} = 15.6 K), multiphase Y-Pd-B-C (Ref. 2) (superconducting transition temperature, T_{c} = 23.2 K), _R_Ni2B2C (Refs. 3-6) (Lu-Gd; T_{c} = 16.6 K for Lu) has had enormous impact on superconductivity research during the last two years and has led to renewed interest in the search for high-temperature superconductivity in multielement intermetallic compounds and possibly exotic superconductivity mechanism(s) leading to T_{c} higher than 10 K. T_{c} values of these borocarbides are similar to those of the other well-known high-_T__c_ intermetallic A - 15 superconductors.7 Two fascinating features of _R_Ni2B2C compounds are that they contain a large amount of nickel, a ferromagnetic metal usually detrimental to superconductivity, and that superconductivity is observed not only for the nonmagnetic rare-earth elements but also for the heavy magnetic rare earths like Tm, Er, Ho, and Dy having a large saturation magnetic moment. They exhibit a spectrum of very interesting physical properties depending upon the R atom; compounds with R = Y, Lu seem to be isotropic,8 BCS-type9 superconductors with relatively high T_{c} ; R = Yb belongs to the heavy fermion system10,11 and is not superconducting down to 0.34 K;11R = Tm-Dy exhibit the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic order (generally antiferromagnetic) with additional effects due to anisotropy induced by crystalline electric fields.5,12-17 Compounds with R = Tb and Gd are not superconducting at least above 0.5 and 1.4 K, respectively.18-22

The structure of these compounds is body-centered-tetragonal (space group _I4/mmm_) with alternating square-planar layers of rare-earth carbides and corrugated Ni2B2 sheets with a unit cell consisting of two formula units.23 This is the same as the ThCr2Si2 structure with an additional carbon atom per rare-earth atom in the rare-earth layer. The structure has Ni-B sheets running parallel to the basal plane and seems to be highly anisotropic from the view point of the ratio of _c_/_a_ which is approximately 3 for both YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C compounds since their lattice parameters are a = 3.526 A, c = 10.534 A [YNi2B2C (Ref. 24)] and a = 3.464 A, c = 10.631 A [LuNi2B2C (Ref. 23)], respectively. These characteristics are somewhat similar to those of cuprate superconductors although the T_{c} for the borocarbides is much smaller than that of the cuprates. The electronic structure of transition-metal borides and carbides has generally been characterized by strong covalent bonding between the constituent elements,25 but band-structure calculations on LuNi2B2C (Refs. 26-30) and YNi2B2C (Refs. 26, 31) show that these are thoroughly three-dimensional metals belonging to the family of conventional superconductors with a relatively high density of states at the Fermi level E_{F} . The states near the Fermi level are dominated by the Ni(3_d_) character with some contributions from other atoms. Ni(3_d_), and B(2_p_) states hybridize by a very small amount around E_{F}, but the strength of such a hybridization is not so great as that of Cu-O hybridization within CuO2 planes in high-_T__c_ cuprates, and bridging carbon atoms provide strong interlayer interactions which lead to the three-dimensional structure.30 The calculated density of states shows a peak at E_{F} arising from a relatively dispersionless energy band which is close to E_{F}.26 No peak in the density of states at E_{F} has been observed32,33 in photoemission studies on polycrystalline YNi2B2C, the absence of which has been attributed to the effects of electron correlations due to the presence of nickel, a 3_d_-late transition metal, which gives rise to strong electron correlations. One might expect nickel to give rise to possible magnetism in these compounds, but no local magnetic moment on Ni atoms has been inferred either from neutron-diffraction measurements on polycrystalline samples down to 2 K (Ref. 21) or from NMR experiments34 on single-crystal YNi2B2C although earlier NMR studies on polycrystalline YNi2B2C (Ref. 35) and muon spin-rotation measurements of the internal field in polycrystalline TmNi2B2C (Ref. 36) suggest the existence of dynamically fluctuating moments on Ni atoms. Since Ni-derived 3d electrons are considered to be superconducting electrons in these compounds, the possibility of the existence of a localized moment on Ni atoms is not reasonable since it would lead to strong pair breaking if superconductivity is due to _s_-wave pairing. Boron in these compounds, it is speculated, gives rise to higher phonon frequencies because of its low mass, and consequently a high T_{c}. Both a band-structure calculation28 and an isotope experiment37 seem to confirm that the high-frequency optical phonons associated with B atoms play an important role in the superconductivity of these compounds. The role of carbon is not clear although it is absolutely essential since YNi2B does not show superconductivity. A recent structural study38 on polycrystalline YNi2B2C reported highly anisotropic thermal vibrations of C atoms and may have some bearing on the high T_{c} of these compounds.

Since the discovery of these borocarbide superconductors, extensive studies have been done on their superconducting properties and the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism in some of these compounds in the polycrystalline state as well as with single crystals.39 A number of superconducting studies indicate that these are type-II superconductors with a small coherence length (~50-100 A). Theoretical studies26-31 as well as some experimental reports24,40,41 indicate that these are moderately strong-coupling superconductors, and the observation of soft phonon modes for R =Lu (Ref. 42) seems to suggest the same, but recent tunneling measurements9 show them to be weak-coupling BCS type. Many experimental results indicate that these compounds are the conventional phonon-mediated _s_-wave superconductors although some deviations are reported, namely absence of the coherent peak in the NMR relaxation rate below T_{c},43T^{3} dependence of the specific heat in a wide range of temperatures below T_{c},24 and anomalous non-BCS temperature dependence of _H__c_1,l(_T_,H = 0) and microwave impedance.44 Each family of superconductors so far discovered, including A -15 compounds, Cheverl compounds, cuprates, and fullerides, possesses characteristic structural and electronic features which have important bearing on the occurrence of superconductivity in them. Normal-state transport properties of superconductors provide important information which is expected to lead to an understanding of superconductivity in them. The recent availability of good single crystals of these borocarbides provides a unique opportunity to investigate the normal-state transport properties in well characterized samples without the granularity problems present in polycrystalline samples which could be detrimental to interpretation of results on transport properties. While there has been feverish activity on studies of the superconducting properties, and the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in these borocarbides, there are hardly any reports on studies of the normal-state transport properties of these compounds except our preliminary reports14,39,45 on single-crystal R Ni2B2C, (_R_ = Y, Lu-Gd), recent brief reports on thermopower46 of polycrystalline YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C, and the thermal conductivity of YNi2B2C and HoNi2B2C single crystals.47 In this paper we present results of detailed studies on in-plane electrical resistivity and thermopower in single crystals of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C along with their superconducting properties. While YNi2B2C is a widely investigated compound, only a few reports have appeared on LuNi2B2C. These compounds do not show any sign of magnetic order or crystal-field effects which do influence the transport properties of the analogous compounds with other rare earths and make interpretation of their transport properties more difficult. Results are compared with the high-_T__c_ cuprates and A -15 compound superconductors wherever appropriate.

## Experimental Details

Single crystals of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C are grown by a Ni2B flux method.48 An arc-melted and well-annealed single-phase polycrystalline ingot of YNi2B2C (LuNi2B2C) compound is placed in an alumina crucible with an equal mass of Ni2B on top of it and is melted in flowing pure argon gas at 1763 K. The melt is cooled to 1473 K at 10 K/h, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature (RT). Single crystals of YNi2B2C (LuNi2B2C) grow into the flux from the original polycrystalline compound. These crystals can be easily removed from the original polycrystalline ingot. The crystals are platelike having mostly irregular shapes with surfaces in the _ab_ plane. The x-ray diffraction of these platelets show that they are single crystals of YNi2B2C (LuNi2B2C) with the c axis perpendicular to the flat surfaces. The as-grown single-crystal platelets usually have somewhat rough surfaces with a metallic shine and luster.

The flux-free single-crystal platelets are cut into rectangular parallelepiped shapes using a wire saw for the resistivity and thermoelectric power measurements. The typical size of these samples is 2.0 mm x 1.0 mm x 0.3 mm. The crystal surfaces are ground flat and then polished mechanically to remove the surface roughness and make them uniformly thick.

The resistivity is measured using a dc four-probe technique. Two 0.15 mm copper wires are attached to the sample as the current leads using indium solder. The voltage leads consist of two heavy formvar insulated 0.1 mm diameter copper wires which are attached to the sample with Epotek 410E silver epoxy.49 The maximum error in the absolute resistivity value comes mainly from the uncertainties in the distance between two voltage leads due to the finite width of  the electrical contacts (since the sample length is very small) and the thickness measurement. Considering all the possible errors, the uncertainty in the absolute resistivity is no more than +-10% and much less for relative measurements. The resistance in zero applied magnetic field is measured from RT (300 K) to 4.2 K and in applied magnetic field (maximum 5 T) between 25 and 4.2 K. A double can He-4 cryostat equipped with a 6 T superconducting magnet is used for the measurements. More experimental details can be found in an earlier publication.[14]

Thermopower of the samples is measured using a differential technique with temperature gradient along the _ab_ plane. Samples for thermopower measurements are cut from the same block of a single crystal of YNi_{2}B_{2}C (LuNi_{2}B_{2}C) from which samples for the resistance measurements were cut. The cryostat used for thermopower measurements is similar to the one described earlier[50] but with some improvements in its design and automatic data collection. The differential temperature across the sample is measured using a calibrated 0.075 mm diameter Au 0.07 % Fe/chromel thermocouple. The thermopower of each sample is measured against a 0.1 mm manganin wire precalibrated against a well annealed lead foil. Samples are kept in a 10^{-6} torr dynamic vacuum during the measurements. The absolute accuracy in the thermopower is estimated to be +-0.1 \muV/K.

## Results and Discussion

### Normal-state resistivity

Room-temperature (RT, 300 K) in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} of single crystals of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C are measured to be 67.1 and 46.8 \mu\Omega cm, respectively. The lower resistivity of single-crystal LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples is probably due to better growth of the crystal with less imperfections and/or defects. This is also reflected in the residual resistivity ratio (RR) as indicated later. These in-plane resistivity values are of the same order of magnitude as for some of binary alloys of the rare-earth and transition-metal intermetallic compounds/alloys[51] and some A -15 compounds.[7] Figure 1 displays the temperature dependence of \rho_{ab}, to be denoted \rho hereafter, of single-crystal samples of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C from 300 to 4.2 K and in zero applied magnetic field H. The resistivity is clearly seen to be metallic, i.e., \rho decreases with a decrease in temperature. This decrease in \rho is approximately linear with T at higher temperatures (near RT) although a slight curvature towards the T axis is clearly visible pointing to a possibility of saturation of the resistivity at higher temperatures. This curvature is slightly more in the case of the YNi_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal (sc) sample. [_dp_/_dT_]RT values for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C and sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C are 0.22 and 0.15 \mu\Omega cm/K, respectively. As the temperature is lowered below ~100 K, the resistivity becomes nonlinear and finally drops abruptly to zero at the superconducting transition temperatures 15.6 and 16.1 K, respectively, for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C and sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples (to be referred to as Y and Lu samples hereafter for brevity wherever convenient), respectively. The superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) value of YNi_{2}B_{2}C agrees well with the T_{c} values reported by others,[5, 4, 48, 52, 53] but T_{c} for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C is slightly smaller than that observed by others,[34, 35, 30, 54, 55, 36] The superconducting transition width for either sample is ~0.25 K which is quite sharp, indicating the good quality (homogeneity) of both samples. The good quality of these crystals is further confirmed by a reasonably high resistivity ratio RR, defined as, \rho(300)/\rho(T_{c},onset). i.e., RR(Y) = 18 and RR(Lu) = 25, where \rho(T_{c},onset) of the Y and Lu samples are 3.8 and 1.9 \mu\Omega cm, respectively. The lower RR value of the Y sample implies that the Y sample has more imperfections. The resistivity just above the superconducting transition temperature does not seem to become temperature independent for either sample, exhibiting a weak temperature dependence.

Based on the measured values of \rho(RT) and [_dp_/_dT_]RT of the Y and Lu samples in this work, and recently reported theoretical band-structure calculations,[27] estimates of the electron mean free path (_l_) and the transport electron-phonon coupling parameter (l_u_) are made for these materials.

The resistivity can be written as

\[\rho^{-1} = \frac{2}{3}\ e^{2}N(0)\nu_{F}l,\] (1)

where _N_(0) is the band quasiparticle density of states at the Fermi level and n_{F} is the Fermi velocity. The values of _N_(0) for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C and YNi_{2}B_{2}C have been calculated[27, 31] and are 4.8 and 4.03 states/(eV unit cell), respectively. The Fermi velocity n_{F} also has been calculated[27] to be 3.6 x 107 cm/s for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. No such estimate of n_{F} is available for YNi_{2}B_{2}C. Hence, n_{F} of YNi_{2}B_{2}C is assumed to be the same as that of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C since they have similar band structures. These numbers in Eq. (1) give _l_(Y) = 110 A and _l_(Lu) = 190 A at T = 16 K, and _l_(Y) = 6.1 A and _l_(Lu) = 7.6 A at 300 K. The electron mean free path l at room temperature in these samples is of the order of their atomic spacing, and therefore, the semiclassical Boltzmann theory may not be strictly valid to describe the transport phenomena at room and higher temperatures. In addition, possible anharmonicity and Fermi smearing effects at higher temperature may be responsible for producing some flattening of the resistivity near room temperature. Since _l_(Y) is smaller than _l_(Lu) at RT, the relatively larger flattening of the resistivity of YNi_{2}B_{2}C near

Figure 1: Temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity of single-crystal samples of YNi_{2}B_{2}C (open circles) and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (open triangles). The inset shows the resistivity variation near T_{c}.

  room temperature in comparison with that of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C is understandable. The resistivity flattening effect is truly very small here, and therefore, linearity between \rho and T near RT is essentially valid in this range.

In the Bloch-Gruneisen transport theory the temperature dependence of \rho is related to the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm tr} by the relation [57]

\[\frac{d\rho}{dT}=\frac{8\,\pi^{2}}{\hbar\,\omega_{p}^{2}}\,k_{B}\lambda_{\rm tr},\] (2)

where \omega_{p} is the Drude plasma frequency which is related to N(0) through the relation

\[\hbar^{2}\,\omega_{p}^{2}=4\,\pi e^{2}N(0)\,\nu_{F}^{2}.\] (3)

Equation (2) assumes that residual resistivity and other contributions to \rho are negligibly small compared to the electron-phonon contribution described by the standard Boltzmann transport theory. Further, Eq. (2) is valid for T>0.7 \Theta_{D} where \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature [57]. The reported values of \Theta_{D} for YNi_{2}B_{2}C are 489 K (Ref. [52]) and 537 K [24], and \approx350 K for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C [40, 54]. The use of Eq. (2) to calculate \lambda_{\rm tr} from \rho (RT) and [d\rho/dT]_{\rm RT} values seems to be reasonable for sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, but it is only approximately correct for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C since RT (300 K)<0.7 \Theta_{D}(Y). The plasma frequency of each compound can be calculated using Eq. (3) which gives 5.1 eV for sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C and 4.7 eV for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C where r_{F}=3.6\times10^{7} cm/s is assumed for both samples, and N(0)=4.8 and 4.03 states/(eV unit cell) for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [27]) and YNi_{2}B_{2}C [31] respectively. A substitution of [d\rho({\rm Y})/dT]_{\rm RT}=0.22 \mud\Omega cm/K and [d\rho({\rm Lu})/dT]_{\rm RT}=0.15 \mu\Omega cm/K in Eq. (2) yields \lambda_{\rm tr}(Y)=1.2 and \lambda_{\rm tr}(Lu)=0.97 as listed in Table I. Another recent calculation [30] for Lu gives the value N(0)=3.88 states/(eV unit cell) which produces a smaller value for \lambda_{\rm tr}. These values seem reasonable and represent a semiempirical measure of electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda which appears in the McMillan equation for the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}[58]. With the knowledge of T_{c} and the Debye temperature \Theta_{D} of a superconductor, \lambda can be estimated from the McMillan equation

\[k_{B}T_{c}=\frac{\hbar\,\omega_{\rm log}}{1.2}\,\exp\left[-\,\frac{1.04(1+ \lambda)}{\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda)}\right],\] (4)

where \omega_{\rm log} is taken to be 0.7 \omega_{\rm ph}, \omega_{\rm ph} is regarded to be same as the Debye frequency \omega_{D}=k_{B}\Theta_{D}/\hbar, and \mu^{*} is Coulomb pseudopotential and usually taken between 0.1 and 0.15. Values of \lambda determined from Eq. (4) with \mu^{*}=0.15 are given in Table I. Closer agreement with \lambda_{\rm tr} is found for \mu^{*}=0.15 for Y, but for Lu better agreement is found with \mu^{*}=0.10. It is not clear why this should be since the electronic and phonon structures of the two compounds should be very similar.

The electron phonon coupling parameter can also be estimated from the ratio of N(0)|_{\rm obs}/N(0)|_{\rm band}=\gamma|_{\rm obs}/\gamma|_{\rm band}=(1+ \lambda_{\gamma}), where \gamma is the specific-heat constant and \lambda_{\gamma} is the electron-phonon mass enhancement parameter which should be similar to \lambda. Movshovich _et al._[52] reported \gamma_{\rm obs}=18.7 mJ/(mol K^{2}) for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C, and the calculated value [31] of \gamma_{\rm band} for YNi_{2}B_{2}C is 9.5 mJ/(mol K^{2}) with N(0)\approx4.03 states/(eV unit cell). Similarly, \gamma_{\rm obs} LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [40])=19 mJ/(mol K^{2}) and calculated \gamma_{\rm band}=11.3 mJ/(mol K^{2}) using N(0)=4.8 states/(eV unit cell). The calculated value N(0)=3.88 states/(eV unit cell) for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [30]) gives \gamma_{\rm band}=9.15 mJ/(mol K^{2}). The corresponding values of \lambda_{\gamma} are listed in Table I. There appears to be a particularly wide spread in the various estimates for Lu, but values for Y are reasonably consistent. A 10-15 % disagreement among the electron-phonon coupling parameters obtained from different procedures is commonly found in other superconductors [57]. In any case, the range of \lambda_{\rm tr} or \lambda values are such that these compounds would be considered to be only moderately strong-coupling superconductors. A comparison of these compounds with some A-15 superconductors which have T_{c} near 15 K, i.e., Nb_{3}Sn (T_{c}\approx17 K), V_{3}Si (T_{c}\approx15 K) shows that \lambda values for Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C superconductors are close to that of V_{3}Si (\lambda\approx1.0) but much smaller than that of Nb_{3}Sn (\lambda\approx1.8) or Nb_{3}Al (\lambda\approx1.5). [57]. Strong-coupling elemental superconductors Pb and Nb have \lambda\approx1.2. [57]

A similarity between Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C and A-15 high-T_{c} superconductors is also found in the temperature dependence of their resistivities at low temperatures, i.e., 1.25T_{c}<T<0.1\Theta_{D}. Below 100 K, the resistivity of either borocarbide compound shows a nonlinearity with temperature and it does not decrease as rapidly as expected from the Bloch-Gruneisen theory. To determine the exact temperature dependence of \rho(T), the low-temperature data was fitted to the expression

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{p}\] (5)

in the temperature interval 1.25T_{c}<T<0.1\Theta_{D} using a least-squares fit procedure, with the square of the correlation coefficient to determine the goodness of the fit. The temperature region above 20 K was chosen to minimize the superconducting fluctuation effects. Figure 2 shows the plot of \rho vs T^{2.2} for the Y sample. The in-plane \rho_{0}, A, and p parameters obtained from the fit are 3.38 \mu\Omega cm, 8.1\times10^{-4}\mu\Omega cm/K^{p}, and 2.2 for the sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C, and 1.36 \mu\Omega cm, 1.8\times10^{-3}\mu\Omega cm/K^{p}, and 2.0 for the sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. Thus, the low-temperature in plane resistivity of these metallic sc-Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C compounds seems to be anomalous in the temperature region 1.25T_{c}<T<0.1\Theta_{D} in a sense that its temperature dependence is different from the T^{5} or T^{3} dependence expected from the conventional theory and usually

  observed for ordinary and transition metals. The exponent p, which is approximately equal to 2 for either of these borocarbide compounds, is similar to the one found [7, 59] for \rho(T) of disordered superconducting high-T_{c}A-15 compounds (Nb_{3}Sn, Nb_{3}Al, Nb_{3}Ge, V_{3}Si, etc.), i.e., p = 2. The value of A is smaller for the Y sample than for the Lu sample as expected from the resistivity values. The T^{2} behavior of p in A-15 compounds was initially suggested by Webb _et al._[60] to be due to a non-Debye phonon spectrum _F_(_o_) which was later discounted by Gurvitch [61] through a careful analysis of \rho(T) data on disordered A-15 compounds. The possibility that the electron-electron interaction gives the T^{2} dependence of \rho(T) can be ruled out since the coefficient A is about two to three orders of magnitude larger than expected from this scattering mechanism [59, 60, 62]. The T^{2} behavior is also observed in magnetic or nearly magnetic metals. It is possible that scattering from reported antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the Ni sites [35, 36], could contribute to this temperature dependence, but other experiments [21, 34] do not confirm these reports. Gurvitch [63] has proposed that strong electron-phonon coupling is the necessary condition for observing \rho_{\rm e-ph}\alpha T^{2} in A-15 compounds, but it is not sufficient; the simultaneous presence of strong coupling and high disorder are required to produce the temperature exponent p equal to 2.0. A high disorder results in the breakdown of the electron-phonon momentum conservation law **k**\pm\bar{q}=**k^{\prime}** and may be responsible for the T^{2} behavior of p in the A-15's. R Ni_{2}B_{2}C (_R_ = Y,Lu) have l values similar to those of some of A-15 compounds, but the samples investigated here are single crystals, and therefore do not have large disorder. Therefore the possibility of the breakdown of the electron-phonon momentum conservation law does not arise. The present result \rho(T)\alpha T^{2} for sc-Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C at low temperatures must be due to some other mechanism(s). Recent photoemission studies [32] on YNi_{2}B_{2}C indicate that the Ni 3_d_-derived conduction bands are narrower than the calculated ones, and are accompanied by a satellite. These results are indicative of the presence of electron-electron correlation effects. Such effects, as well as some other unidentified scattering mechanisms, may be responsible for the quadratic temperature dependence at low temperatures.

While no measurements on the _c_-axis electrical resistivity of any borocarbide superconductors _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C have been reported as yet, Sera _et al._[47] have recently reported in-plane and the _c_-axis thermal conductivity measurements on _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C (_R_ = Y,Ho). They find little anisotropy between the c and a axes at low temperatures. Assuming that the Wiedemann-Franz law is valid for these superconductors, it means that there will be little anisotropy between the in-plane and _c_-axis resistivities, unlike in high-temperature superconductors, although these borocarbide superconductors also have a layered structure.

Figure 3 shows the dependence of in-plane resistance of YNi_{2}B_{2}C at 25 K as a function of magnetic field (parallel to the c axis) up to 4.5 T. The change in the resistance at 4.5 T is about 6.5% which is quite large in comparison with normal metals [64]. Figure 3 clearly shows that the resistance varies nearly as H^{2} for low field values, and seems to become linear with H at higher magnetic fields. A fit to data to R(T,H) = R(T,0) + R1 * H + R2 * H^{2} shows that R 1/_R_ 2 * 10 indicating that there is a substantial contribution from the linear term in addition to the quadratic term. A fit to the power law [_R_(_T_,_H_) - R(T,0)]/_R_(_T_,0) = AH^{*} gives n = 1.27 indicating that the magnetic-field dependence of the magnetoresistance is closer to linear than quadratic in H. This fit is shown as an inset in Fig. 3. At lower temperature, i.e., T = 15 K, we find [_R_(_T_,4.5T_) - R(T,0)]/_R_(_T_,0) = 7.5% and 8.0% for H parallel and perpendicular to the c axis indicating a small anisotropy in the magnetoresistance. A similar amount of magnetoresistance has been observed in a YNi_{2}B_{2}C polycrystalline sample [65]. Magnetoresistance of the order of 40% at 8 T (with magnetic field perpendicular to the current) has been reported [55] in polycrystalline LuNi_{2}B_{2}C with estimated electron mean free path l = 700 A. It is difficult to explain such a large electron mean free path in a polycrystalline sample compared to the value of about 200 A in our single-crystal sample of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. In contrast, we find a magnitude (\Delta R/_R_ * 7.3% for H = 45 kOe at 20 K) and field dependence for sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C very similar to that shown in Fig. 3. Perhaps the grain boundaries in the polycrystalline sample in Ref. [55] consist of a different compound with very unusual properties.

When a magnetic field is applied, the resulting electron orbits may be closed or open depending upon the topology of the Fermi surface. The transverse magnetoresistance saturates for closed orbits but grows indefinitely as H^{2} for open orbits [64, 66, 67]. A linear magnetoresistance at high fields has been observed for single crystals as well as polycrystalline materials [68, 69, 70, 71]. While there is hardly any good understanding of the linear magnetoresistance, it has been shown theoretically to occur in polycrystals with open orbits [66, 72] due to thickness variation [73], or also if the carrier transport takes place along two-dimensional skipping-orbit states [74]. Most recently Park and Kim [75] have shown that the interference of two open orbits modeled by two cylindrical Fermi surfaces gives rise to a linear transverse magnetoresistance when the magnetic field is slightly tilted from the direction perpendicular to the plane defined by the cylinder axes. Kim, Hwang, and Ihm [30] show that there are five electronic complex Fermi surfaces of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, one of which is a cylindrical surface perpendicular to the c axis. Thus, the open electron orbits are expected in LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (and YNi_{2}B_{2}C due to similarity between their band structures) which may lead to the linear magnetoresistance as predicted by Park and Kim and observed by us at high fields. A more careful study of

  magnetoresistance in these compounds is needed for a better understanding of the phenomenon.

### Thermopower

The absolute thermopower, S(T), measured with temperature gradient along the _ab_ plane of the single crystals of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, is shown in Fig. 4 as a function of temperature. S(T) is negative for both the samples from RT to just above the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} where it rapidly drops to zero within the measurement accuracy. The superconducting transition temperatures determined this way are within \pm0.25 K of that determined by the resistivity measurements. The sharp fall of S to zero at T_{c} also confirms the good quality of the samples. The negative thermopower does not necessarily mean that the charge carriers in these compounds are electrons; [76] however, the band-structure calculations [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] indicate so. Hall effect measurements are needed to ascertain the nature of charge carriers. The thermopower of both samples is seen to be linear in T near room temperature within the measurement accuracy. Room-temperature thermopower S(RT) and [dS/dT]_{\rm RT} are -8.1 \muV/K and -11.5 nV/K^{2}, and -7.3 \muV/K and -10.4 nV/K^{2} for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples, respectively, which are nearly the same for both samples. The magnitude of S(RT), reported here, is somewhat larger than the typical value associated with free electron/conventional metals, i.e., -1.28 \muV/K for lead and 1.94 \muV/K for gold, but it is approximately the same as for palladium [76] [S(RT)=-10 \muV/K] and many high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors. [77]

The thermopower of conventional nonmagnetic metals consists of two contributions, a diffusion contribution and a phonon-drag contribution resulting from the transfer of phonon momentum to the electron gas. The diffusion contribution is proportional to temperature, while the phonon-drag contribution falls at low temperature as the phonons freeze out, and at high temperatures as the excess phonon momentum gets limited by phonon-phonon scattering. This usually results in a phonon-drag peak in conventional metals with T^{3} dependence below 0.1\Theta_{D} and falls as T^{-1} above \approx0.3\Theta_{D}. Figure 4 clearly shows that there are no structures (peak, etc.) in S vs T data from RT down to T_{c}, i.e., no obvious phonon-drag peak is present which one would expect, [76] if present, in the temperature region 0.1\Theta_{D}<T<0.3\Theta_{D}. Since these samples are single crystals and have reasonably high resistivity ratios one would have expected some signature of a phonon-drag peak in the data. However, the usual signature is totally absent, and S is similar to that in amorphous metals [78, 79] and, except for sign, many high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors. [77]

It is obvious from the thermopower data that in addition to the diffusion thermopower, which is proportional to the temperature, there is(are) additional contribution(s) to the thermopower yielding the observed temperature dependence of S. Figure 5 shows data (S-bT) vs T for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals, where b is the coefficient obtained by fitting the S vs T data to a straight line, i.e., S(T)=a+bT, in the linear region (T\approx100 K to RT). (S-bT) represents contributions to the thermopower other than the diffusion thermopower, and as observed from Fig. 5, this contribution is negative and almost constant between 100 and 300 K for both samples; approximately -4.3 \muV/K for the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C sample and -4.8 \muV/K for the YNi_{2}B_{2}C sample. Below 100 K, this contribution to the thermopower for each sample varies approximately as T^{-1}, until the superconducting transition temperature at which it rises abruptly to zero. Generally, the most important contribution to the thermopower of a metal, in addition to the diffusion thermopower, is the phonon-drag contribution. Any contribution from possible magnetic impurities is expected to be much smaller than that observed in Fig. 5. Recently, Trodahl [80] tried to explain the thermopower of high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors by including the phonon-drag contribution with the assumption that the phonon-phonon scattering in high-T_{c} cuprates remains weaker than phonon-electron scattering even at room temperature. He finds that the temperature dependence of the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower of high-T_{c} cuprates is very similar to that shown for S-bT in Fig. 5, i.e., it is almost temperature independent between 100 K and RT, and this constant value represents

Figure 3: Field dependence of the transverse magnetoresistance, \Delta R/R(0,25 K)=[R(H,25 K)-R(0,25 K)]R(0,25 K) for YNi_{2}B_{2}C with magnetic field parallel to the c axis. The inset shows the variation of the magnetoresistance with H^{1,27}.

  the saturation value of the phonon-drag thermopower. This kind of temperature dependence of the phonon-drag thermopower leads to a simple shift of the linear diffusion thermopower between 100 K and RT. This particular behavior relates to the layered nature of high-T_{c} cuprates. Borocarbides are also layered compounds; hence a similar phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower may not be unreasonable. Therefore, assuming that Fig. 5 represents the phonon-drag contribution to the total thermopower the saturation value of this contribution in sc-Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C is estimated to be \approx-4.5\muV/K.

The extrapolation of the data of Fig. 4 near room temperature, assuming a linear T dependence of S, does not pass through S = 0 at T = 0, and gives intercepts of - 4.61 and - 4.34\muV/K, respectively, for the Y and Lu samples. This result implies that, in the absence of superconductivity, there would be a low temperature "knee" in S(T), similar to that produced by electron-phonon renormalization.[81] This "knee" seems to be present near 70 K for Y and 100 K for Lu samples. Electron-phonon renormalization would lead to an enhanced thermopower that is given by

\[S = S_{b}[1 + \lambda(T)],\]

where \lambda(T) is the electron-phonon mass enhancement parameter and S_{b} is the bare thermopower (without renormalization effects). In this expression certain corrections[82] have been assumed small and therefore neglected. Equation (6) can be rewritten as

\[\frac{S}{T} = \frac{S_{b}}{T}\left[ {1 + \lambda(T)} \right].\]

A plot of S/T vs T should then give a measure of \lambda(T), and \left[ {S/T} \right]_{T = 0}/\left[ {S/T} \right]_{\rm RT} should approximate 1 + \lambda(0).[79] Assuming that the S/T value just above T_{c} is \left[ {S/T} \right]_{T = 0} as an approximation, we find that \lambda(0) > 5 - 6 which is absurdly high when compared to the estimated values of \lambda(0) for Y (Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C by others[26, 27, 30, 31] or to those obtained here or to the values observed for even very strong-coupling superconductors[57] (viz. Pb-Bi alloys). It may be mentioned that a recent \muSR study[83] on YNi_{2}B_{2}C reports a mass-enhancement factor of 9.4 from penetration depth measurements. Recently Kaiser and Mountioy[84] have explained the thermopower of high-T_{c} superconductors within the existing metallic diffusion-thermopower theory in terms of an anomalously large strong electron-phonon coupling (greater than 5), such as might arise from an anharmonic double-well potential[85] in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - \phi} It has been recently reported[86] that the electron-phonon coupling \lambda for a double-well potential could reach huge values, 5 - 50 or more. Whether large and anisotropic thermal vibrations of carbon atoms in the Y-C plane in YNi_{2}B_{2}C, as observed by Godart _et al._,[38] would lead to such a situation should be studied theoretically.

In the presence of spin fluctuations, Eq. (7) is modified to

\[\frac{S}{T} = \frac{S_{b}}{T}\left[ {1 + \lambda(T) + \lambda_{\rm sf}} \right\rbrack,\]

where \lambda_{\rm sf} is the mass-enhancement parameter due to spin fluctuations. Kohara _et al._ and others[35] have reported the presence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in polycrystalline YNi_{2}B_{2}C but a NMR study of single-crystal YNi_{2}B_{2}C by Suh _et al.[34]_ shows no antiferromagnetic correlations. Even if such fluctuations were present, one would not expect \lambda_{\rm sf} to have large values which could explain \left[ {S/T} \right]_{T = 0}/\left[ {S/T} \right]_{\rm RT} = 5 - 7.

Lee _et al.[46]_ have reported S(T) for polycrystalline YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. They find S(RT) values to be - 5.1 and - 4.7\muV/K for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C polycrystalline samples, respectively. These are almost two-thirds of the values reported here for the single-crystal samples. [dS/dT] is almost zero in their work in the temperature interval 150 K < T<RT. Thus, the present results on YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals are in disagreement, except for the sign of the thermopower, with those on polycrystalline Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C. However, the single-crystal measurements are taken with \Delta T along the ab plane. Polycrystalline samples would give an average of the thermopower along the ab plane and the c axis, appropriately weighted for the conductivities in those directions.[76] Since no measurement of thermopower is available along the c axis of these crystals, it is not possible to comment on it quantitatively. If this is the reason for the difference between S for single crystals and polycrystalline samples, the polycrystalline results indicate a possibility of a positive thermopower along the c axis of Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C single crystals. Lee _et al.[46]_ have suggested that the nonlinear behavior of the thermopower of Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C polycrystalline samples may be due to the mixed-valence phenomenon like that found in CeNi_{x},[87] and they found a good fit to the expression S' = S - bT = \Delta T/(B^{2} + T^{2}), where b, A, and B are constants. The data for single crystals presented here could not be well described by such a fit, and there is no reason to expect temperature-dependent valence fluctuations in these compounds. Possibly the difference may be attributed to a strikingly different behavior between the

The coefficient b is the slope of the straight line obtained by least-squares fitting of the data in the linear region (between 100 K and RT).

Symbols are the same as in Fig. 4.

### Superconductivity

The superconducting transition temperatures of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal samples are found to be 15.6 and 16.1 K, respectively, from the resistive transition measurements where T_{c} is defined as the intersection of the line drawn through the steepest part of the transition curve with the temperature axis. In order to determine the upper critical field H_{c2}(T), resistance of the samples has been measured as a function of temperature in various fixed values of magnetic fields applied parallel and perpendicular to the c axis of both samples. Figure 6 shows the results for YNi_{2}B_{2}C sample with the applied magnetic field perpendicular to the c axis which clearly shows that the magnetic field _basically_ shifts the resistive transition curve without affecting the transition width significantly at lower magnetic fields (H<50 kOe), i.e., the effect of H is only to decrease T_{c} of the sample. The large positive magnetoresistance can also be seen in this figure. Similar behavior of the resistive superconducting transition is observed for a magnetic field applied parallel to the c axis of YNi_{2}B_{2}C and for both field directions with LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. Magnetization measurements, i.e., M vs T for single-crystal YNi_{2}B_{2}C also show similar behavior for different applied magnetic fields.[8, 48] This behavior of the superconducting transition in an applied magnetic field is in contrast with the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors in which the transition width increases even in presence of a small external magnetic field, and where it increases enormously as the applied magnetic field is increased, leading to extensive tailing effects as R approaches zero.[88] In such a case it becomes difficult to define H_{c2}(T); however, the sharp transition curves for sc-Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C samples investigated here permit determination of H_{c2}(T) unambiguously.

T_{c}(H) is determined from the intersection of the straight line drawn through the steep superconducting transition region and the T axis which is then converted into H_{c2}(T) for each sample. We shall refer to H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) as the upper critical fields parallel and perpendicular to the c axis of the crystal. Figures 7 and 8 show H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) vs T for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C and sc-LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples. The current was 50 mA (current density\approx26 A/cm^{2}) for the Y sample, and 10 mA (\approx3 A/cm^{2}) for the Lu sample in the ab plane of each. From the figures we note that the upper critical fields H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) of the Y sample show almost no anisotropy, while those of the Lu sample show a small anisotropy, i.e., [H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T)]_{\rm Lu} is larger than [H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T)]_{\rm Lu} and the difference becomes larger at lower temperatures. [H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T)]_{\rm Lu} is \approx15% higher than [H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T)]_{\rm Lu} at T\approx4.5 K. Absence of the anisotropy of H_{c2}(T) of sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C determined from the resistive transition in a magnetic field agrees well with reports based on magnetization measurements.[8, 48] This observation is in contrast to the strong anisotropy seen in H_{c2}(T) between in-plane and c-axis-aligned fields in cuprate high-T_{c} superconductors[88] which also have a layered structure.

It has been previously reported[14] that H_{c2}(T) for HoNi_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal samples is strongly current dependent, especially in the range of fields and temperature where reentrant superconductivity is observed. To determine if such a dependence exists for sc-YNi_{2}B_{2}C samples, H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) were obtained from the resistive transition curves recorded using two different current densities, i.e., 2.6 and 26 A/cm^{2}, along the ab plane which are shown in Fig. 9. A small current dependence is clearly observed becoming larger at lower temperatures; H_{c2}(T) differs by \approx10% at the lowest temperature (\approx4.5 K) for the two current densities. It should be noted, however, that the anisotropy between H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) and H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T), for a given current density, does not alter, and the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(H= 0) is _exactly_ the same for the two current densities. A similar current density dependence was observed with LuNi_{2}B_{2}C samples. The observed current density dependence of H_{c2}(T) for these samples remains unexplained and is definitely not due to a heating effect, as pointed out earlier.[14]

Figure 7: Temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2} for the YNi_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal sample with magnetic field parallel (open circles) and perpendicular (\times) to the c axis. The current density was \approx26 A/cm^{2} and was along the ab plane. Data deduced from magnetization measurements (Ref. 8) with field normal to the c axis (crosses) are shown for comparison.

  H_{c2}(T) vs T data in Figs. 7 and 8 show that H_{c2}(T) does not intersect the T axis _linearly_ but bends towards the higher T side giving a positive curvature to the H_{c2}(T) curve, i.e., d^{2}H_{c2}/dT^{2}>0. Please note that determination of H_{c2}(T) from magnetization measurements [8] on single-crystal YNi_{2}B_{2}C are in excellent agreement with those from resistance measurements as shown in Fig. 7. A similar positive curvature in H_{c2}(T)|_{T-T_{c}} has been reported in polycrystall-line and single-crystal RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds [8, 14, 54, 55, 89, 90], dichalcogenides [91], amorphous superconductors [92], A-15 superconducting compounds [7], Ba-doped C_{60}[93], and in high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors [94]. The Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki, (WHHM) theory [95, 96], which takes into account the orbital and paramagnetic effects of an external field as well as nonmagnetic and spin-orbit scatterings, is normally used to explain H_{c2}(T) of superconducting alloys (type-II superconductors). The WHHM theory predicts a linear temperature dependence of H_{c2}(T) near T_{c}, i.e., H_{c2}(T)\propto(1 - T/T_{c}), in either the "clean" or the "dirty" limit. This theory thus fails to explain the positive curvature of H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} as observed in a large number of superconducting systems. Several explanations have been advanced to explain this behavior of H_{c2}(T). Some of these are: (1) scattering by magnetic impurities [97], (2) reduced dimensionality and disorder [98, 99], (3) strong electron-phonon coupling effects [100], (4) bipolaron effect [101, 102] and (5) two-component response [90] in granular polycrystalline superconductors (intra- and intergranular effects). In the case of high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, H_{c2}(T) is found to vary as (1 - T/T_{c}) [32] near T_{c} if H_{c2} is derived from the resistance measurements or as (1 - T/T_{c}) if it is derived from magnetization measurements [88]. In high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors this peculiar temperature dependence of H_{c2} near T_{c} has been attributed to the flux flow in R(T,H) measurements as evidenced by long resistive tails in the transition region, and to the twin boundaries limiting the spatial extent of the vortices in one direction [88]. Neither of these possible causes are present in Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C single-crystal samples; yet a positive curvature is observed in H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} regardless of whether the applied magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular to the c axis. Reduced dimensionality and disorder cannot be applicable to either of the two samples investigated here since they behave like three-dimensional metals [26, 27], and they are single crystals with relatively low resistivities, excluding a high degree of disorder. Two-component response [90] may be applicable to the granular polycrystalline samples but not to single-crystal RNi_{2}B_{2}C samples. There seems to be no evidence of applicability of the bipolaron model to RNi_{2}B_{2}C superconductors, moreover in this model [101]H_{c2}(0) goes to infinity unless limited by some additional effects like localization of bosons. The presence of a small amount of magnetic impurities is certainly a possibility but unless these are present in large quantities, H_{c2}(T) is not expected to be affected substantially [88]. A possibility of distributed T_{c} in a given sample does not arise here as the samples are single crystals, and the resistive transitions are quite sharp.

The positive curvature in H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} makes it difficult to apply the standard WHHM theory and its extensions to obtain certain characteristic parameters in the superconducting state of Y(Lu)Ni_{2}B_{2}C single crystals. However, this theory seems to be the only one which would give certain characteristic superconducting parameters. To apply the theory, the H_{c2}(T) vs T data is divided into two sections: (a) the lower temperature data which fits to a straight line yielding T_{ca} which turns out to be lower than the observed T_{c} (T_{ca} is determined by the intersection of this line with the T axis.); (b) The region near T_{c} which shows the positive curvature. Figures 7 and 8 show that the low-temperature data almost lie on a straight line. As a matter of fact one would not expect from the WHHM theory the H_{c2}(T) data to lie on a straight line at such low temperatures (T/T_{c}<0.7). To obtain [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T-T_{c}}, the low-temperature H_{c2}(T) data between T= 0.85T_{c} and 0.25T_{c} is fitted to a straight line. The goodness of the fit is measured by the square of the correlation coefficient (r^{2}>0.997). The slope obtained is not [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T-T_{c}} but [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T-T_{ca}}. This slope is then used to calculate the upper critical field H_{c2}(0), the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi(0) and/or the BCS coherence length \xi(0), the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(0)

Circles and triangles represent data with magnetic field perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the c axis.

  with the knowledge of experimentally determined _H__c_1, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter _k_(0), the magnetic-field penetration depth _k_(0), and the specific-heat constant g, since all of these can be expressed in terms of [_dH__c_2/_dT_]_T_7-_T_c_ and/or the parameters derived from it. However, the exact relationship between these parameters and [_dH__c_2/_dT_]_T_7-_T_c_ depends upon whether the sample is "clean" (_I_b_<=60NS) or "dirty" (_l_<=_k_0BCS). The electron mean free path l has already been estimated for both the samples by the resistivity measurements. The BCS coherence length k0BCS can be determined from the BCS relation:

\[\xi_{0{\text{BCS}}}^{\Delta} = \frac{\hbar v_{F}}{\pi\Delta_{o}},\]

where D_o_ is the energy gap at T = 0 K, and the D superscript on k0BCS indicates that it has been determined using the above relation. Recent break junction tunneling measurements [9] on polycrystalline YNi2B2C show that the energy gap of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C obeys the BCS relation

\[2\Delta_{o} \approx (3.5 \pm 0.1)k_{B}T_{C},\]

suggesting that these are BCS-type weak-coupling superconductors. Equation (9) gives \xi_{0{\text{BCS}}}^{\Delta} = 321 A for YNi2B2C and 311 A for LuNi2B2C where v_{F} = 3.6 x 107 cm/s is taken from the band-structure calculations.27 For both of these compounds, the electron mean free path l is smaller than \xi_{0{\text{BCS}}}^{\Delta}, i.e., [_l_/_k_0BCS] is approximately equal to 0.34 for YNi2B2C and 0.61 for LuNi2B2C. These ratios indicate that the Y and Lu single-crystal samples may be considered as "'quasi-sidirty." Thus, various standard formulas [95, 103, 104] valid for the "dirty" limit are used in the analysis:

\[H_{c2}(0) = 0.693T_{c}\left[ { - \frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}} \right]_{T = T_{c}},\]

where (\xi_{0}^{H_{c2}})^{*} = \xi_{0}^{H_{c2}}/(1 + \lambda), and superscript H_{c2} means that the coherence length is determined from [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T = T_{ca}}, \lambda is the electron-phonon coupling parameter, \gamma is in ergs/(cm^{3} K^{2}) and \rho_{o} is in \Omega cm. With l = l_{u} determined earlier from the resistivity just above T_{c}, and \lambda = \lambda_{uq}, for YNi_{2}B_{2}C \gamma = \gammael^{2}=22.8 mJ/(mol K^{2}), and for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, \gammael^{2}=18.2 mJ/(mol K^{2}) and \gammap^{2}=18.6 mJ/(mol K^{2}). These values agree very well with those reported recently, i.e., 18.7 mJ/(mol K^{2}) for YNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [52]) and 19 mJ/(mol K^{2}) for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C.[40]

While we have used H_{c2}(T) data well below T_{c} to get [dH_{c2}/dT]_{T = T_{ca}}, the positive curvature in H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} has not been explained. Recently Bahcall[107] has shown that solving the BCS-Gor'kov theory near H_{c2}(T) directly by generalizing pairing between plane waves to pairing between many electronic Landau levels leads to significant deviations from the semiclassical theory for clean and isotropic superconductors. This approach lowers the value of the upper critical field and causes H_{c2}(T) to vanish quadratically near T_{c} leading to a positive curvature, i.e., d^{2}H_{c2}/dT^{2}>0 near T_{c} , and indicates that a type-II superconductor converts to type I near T_{c} . Bahcall has given the following equation which describes the temperature dependence of H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} :

\[1.61e^{- 1/g}\sqrt{h} + 0.727h - (1 - t) = 0,\]

where h = H_{c2}^{B}(T)/H_{c2}^{S}(0), H_{c2}^{B}(T) refers to the calculated H_{c2}(T) from Bahcall's theory, H_{c2}^{S}(0) is the upper critical field at T= 0 K in the semiclassical theory, g = V_{\beta}N(0) is the BCS coupling constant, and t = T/T_{c} . In the limit g \rightarrow 0, the semiclassical result, H_{c2}^{S}(0) = H_{c2}(0) = - 0.727T_{c}[dH_{c2}/ dT]_{T = T_{c}} , is obtained (for clean type-II superconductors). For nonzero values of g, the presence of the \sqrt{h} term makes H_{c2}(T) vanish quadratically near T_{c} , not linearly as in the WHHM theory. This theory leads to a smaller value of H_{c2}(0) for nonzero g values, i.e., g = 0.4 leads to an \sim25% reduction in H_{c2}(0) obtained from the semiclassical (WHHM) theory. Equation (17) provides a good fit to the H_{c2}(T) data between T_{c} and T = 0.75T_{c} for both Y and Lu samples. The fit is better for the Lu sample than for the Y sample. Figure 10 shows the fit for H_{c2}^{\rm pl}(T) of the Lu sample, and a similarly good fit is obtained for H_{c2}^{\rm pr}(T) of the Lu sample with g^{\rm pl}=0.40 and g^{\rm pr}=0.38, respectively. The g values for the Y sample are g^{\rm pl}=0.58 and g^{\rm pr}=0.57. The g values suggest that YNi_{2}B_{2}C is a stronger coupling superconductor than LuNi_{2}B_{2}C which is also reflected in the higher value of \lambda_{\rm tr} for YNi_{2}B_{2}C than for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. Bahcall finds g = 0.3 gives a good fit between H_{c2}(T) for Nb_{3}Sn (Ref. [7]) and Eq. (17) near T_{c} . It may be noted that the g value for lead, which is a strong-coupling superconductor, is \sim0.4.[103] Thus, the obtained values of g for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C place them in the strong-coupling superconductor category.

Neither this theory nor the WHHM theory adequately describes the low-temperature behavior of H_{c2}(T) for either of the samples as shown in Fig. 11. Although Bahcall's theory can be fit well to the high-temperature data where the positive curvature is seen, it predicts much too low a value for H_{c2}(T) at lower temperatures. It is difficult to compare the H_{c2}(T) data with the WHHM theory because of the positive curvature it shows near T_{c} , but, if the linear region of the H_{c2}(T) data is extrapolated to T_{ca} and that slope used with the WHHM theory with T_{c} = T_{ca} , the resulting curve does not describe the lower temperature data as shown in Fig. 11. The figure clearly shows that the data lie on a straight line for T< 0.8T_{c} with no indication of deviation from linear behavior down to 0.3T_{c} . Thus, the WHHM theory does not seem to be valid for these samples, even at lower temperatures, i.e., the straight line behavior of the data extends far beyond the region predicted by the WHHM theory. Lower temperature measurements should be made to determine the

[107]) with g=0.4 is represented by the dotted curve. The solid curve is the prediction of the WHHM theory in the âdirtyâ limit.

  extent of the breakdown of theory. Since Bahcall's theory[107] predicts a lower value of H_{c2}(0) than does WHHM (about 23% lower for g\approx0.4) it gives even a worse description at low temperatures. Thus, the theoretical ideas need to be modified in order to explain the experimental H_{c2}(T) results reported here for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals as well as those reported in the literature for other RNi_{2}B_{2}C superconducting compounds.

## Summary and conclusions

Measurements of the in-plane resistivity, in-plane thermopower, and upper critical field H_{c2}(T) for YNi_{2}B_{2}C and LuNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals are reported. The in-plane resistivities for both samples vary approximately linearly at room temperature and follow a power law T^{p} at low temperatures with p =2.2 and 2.0, respectively, for the Y and Lu samples for 1.25T_{c} < T< 0.16\Theta_{D} , similar to that followed by the strong-coupling and disordered A-15 compounds. The analysis of the resistivity data shows that these are moderately strong-coupling superconductors with the electron-phonon parameter \lambda_{u}=1.2 and 0.97 for the Y and Lu samples, respectively. These values agree within 10-15 % with the values obtained from the analysis of the specific-heat and superconducting transition temperature data. The Y sample shows a large and positive transverse magnetoresistance, and is about 8% (H=45 kOe) at 15 K. That for the Lu sample is comparable (about 7% at 20 K), not near the 40% value reported for a polycrystalline sample.[55] A very small anisotropy (\approx2%) is observed with respect to the direction of H parallel and perpendicular to the c axis of the crystal.

The absolute thermopower (S) as well as the slope \left(dS/dT\right)_{\rm RT} of both samples are negative from RT to T_{c} and their magnitudes are approximately the same. S varies approximately linearly near RT and an extrapolation to T=0 gives large intercepts (\approx -4 \muV/K) suggesting that in the absence of superconductivity there would be a low-temperature "knee" in S(T) similar to that produced by electron-phonon renormalization. The ratio of the highest value of S/T at low temperatures to that at RT indicates the possibility of a large value of the electron-phonon parameter \lambda(0), 6-8, which does not agree with the values of \lambda(0) estimated from other experimental measurements. The usual phonon-drag peak shape is not observed, but a large contribution beyond the diffusion term exists. The temperature dependence of this contribution is similar to the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower calculated for high-temperature superconductors (layered compounds) by Trodahl.[86]

The resistive transition curves in external magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the c axis have been used to determine the upper critical field H_{c2}(T). A small current dependence of H_{c2}(T) has been observed in the samples which becomes larger at lower temperatures. H_{c2}(T) for both samples shows a positive curvature near T_{c} which is not predicted by the WHHM theory. Various characteristic superconducting parameters have been calculated using the slope of H_{c2}(T) vs T in the temperature region T< 0.85T_{c} . The upper critical field H_{c2}(0) is typically 65 kOe, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \approx70 A, the BCS coherence length and the penetration depth \lambda(0) are \approx65 and \approx1200 A for YNi_{2}B_{2}C, and \approx35 and \approx800 A for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C, respectively. These numbers show that both samples are type-II superconductors. A severe disagreement between the BCS coherence lengths obtained from the measurement of the energy gap[9] and from H_{c2}(T) measurements is found which can be only somewhat improved if one takes into account the renormalization of the Fermi velocity. H_{c2}(T) for the Y sample does not show any anisotropy with respect to the c axis in agreement with the magnetization measurements,[8] while the Lu sample shows an anisotropy in H_{c2}(T) of about \approx10%. The positive curvature of H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} can be explained in terms of a recent theoretical idea of Bahcall[107] who has calculated H_{c2}(T) directly by generalizing pairing between plane waves to pairing between many electronic Landau levels in presence of a magnetic field within the framework of the BCS-Gor'kov theory. A fit between the experimental data near T_{c} and the theoretical expression given by Bahcall gives the BCS coupling constant V_{\omega}N(0)\approx0.4 for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C and \approx0.6 for YNi_{2}B_{2}C. These values place both samples in the category of strong-coupling superconductors. On the other hand, the low-temperature behavior (down to 4.2 K) of H_{c2}(T) for both samples cannot be explained by either the WHHM or Bahcall's theory. H_{c2}(T) at low temperature greatly exceeds that expected from the slope of the region linear in temperature and presents an interesting challenge to the theory.

* [105] There is a large spread in measured H_{c1}(0) values for YNi_{2}B_{2}C in the literature ranging from 83 Oe (Ref. 104) to 1.12 kOe (Ref. 44). We have chosen H_{c1}(0)=369 Oe (Ref. 82) which gives \lambda(0) in agreement with the value (\approx1200 A) reported by most other workers.
