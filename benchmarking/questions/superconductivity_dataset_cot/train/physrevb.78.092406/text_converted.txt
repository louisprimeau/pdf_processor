###### Abstract

EuFe₂As₂ shows a spin-density wave (SDW) type transition at 190 K and
antiferromagnetic (AF) order below 20 K. Here, we have studied the
effect of K substitution on the SDW transition at high temperature and
AF Eu order at low temperature. 50

## I Introduction

Intense research for the past few months has lead to the discovery of
several new superconductors with T_(c) as high as 52 K in the iron
arsenide compounds.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] Most intriguing among these
superconductors is the fact that superconductivity occurs close to the
magnetic-nonmagnetic borderline, probably indicating an unconventional
(nonphononic) pairing mechanism. While the discussion about the
mechanism and the conventional versus unconventional nature continues,
we try to explore more materials with the aim to assist in sorting out
this debate through more available experimental data on related
compounds. Recently, we have shown that EuFe₂As₂ shows a spin-density
wave (SDW) type transition at 190 K (Ref. [9]) similar to that of
SrFe₂As₂.[10] One may thus expect that appropriate substitution or
application of pressure suppresses the SDW, leading to superconductivity
at the magnetic-nonmagnetic borderline. Taking clue from the results of
K-substituted SrFe₂As₂ (Ref. [2]) we may expect that 50

## II Methods

### Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of Eu_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂ were synthesized by
solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of the starting
elements Eu (99.99

### Theory

In order to understand the influence of the K substitution in EuFe₂As₂,
we have performed density-functional band-structure calculations using a
full potential code fplo (Ref. [17]) within the local (spin) density
approximation [L(S)DA]. Additionally, we have included the strong
Coulomb repulsion in the Eu 4f orbitals on a mean-field level using the
LSDA+_U_ approximation applying the atomic-limit double-counting
scheme.[18] We applied the Perdew-Wang[19] flavor of the
exchange-correlation potential, self-consistency was reached on a well
converged k mesh. The structural parameters and the value of _U_=8 eV
for the Eu 4f states were kept identical to our previous work[9] on the
unsubstituted system throughout all calculations.

## III Results and Discussion

### Experiment

The single-phase nature of the sample is confirmed using powder x-ray
diffraction. Impurity phases amount to less than 5

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity
for EuFe₂As₂ and Eu_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂ samples. Unsubstituted EuFe₂As₂
exhibits a clear drop near 190 K due to SDW instability[9, 11, 12] and
structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic
symmetry.[13] In the K-substituted sample Eu_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂, the
high-temperature anomaly due to the SDW formation is completely
suppressed. By contrast, a superconducting transition is observed at
T_(c) ≈ 32 K. The lower inset of Fig. 1 shows the low-temperature part
of the resistivity. Note, that a linear temperature dependence is found
above the superconducting transition.

Further confirmation of the superconducting transition at 32 K comes
from ac magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 2) which shows a clear diamagnetic
signal. dc magnetic susceptibility measured under zero-field-cooled
(ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) conditions also confirm superconductivity.
The ZFC diamagnetic signal below the superconducting transition is of
the size expected for perfect diamagnetism of Pb. FC measurements also
exhibit diamagnetism, the diamagnetic signal being 10

We also observe a signature for short-range magnetic ordering of the Eu
moments in the magnetic susceptibility below about 10 K.

Since even 10

### Theory

anomalies at $T_{\rm SDW}$=190 K and T_(c)=30 K. The lower inset shows
the electrical resistivity data in temperature range between 20 and 60 K
and the line indicates the linear decrease between 60 and 32 K.

constructed supercells of the unsubstituted system and replaced half of
the Eu ions with K ions. To account for the strong Coulomb repulsion
within the Eu 4f orbitals a typical U value [according to x-ray
absorption spectroscopy and photoemission experiments] of U=8 eV has
been chosen for the LSDA+U calculations. A variation of U within the
physically reasonable range of 6...10 eV does not change our conclusions
since this variation has negligible influence on the states at the Fermi
level that is relevant for the superconductivity.

The calculated total density of states (DOS) of Eu_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂ is
shown in Fig. 4 in comparison to that of Sr_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂. Except
for the localized Eu 4f states at around −2.4 eV, the DOS of both these
systems are quite similar.[20] As in the unsubstituted EuFe₂As₂, the Eu
ions are in a stable 2+ state with a half filled 4f shell, and the
position of the localized 4f level remains basically unchanged.[9]

Our previous work[9] on the unsubstituted system indicates that the Eu
and Fe sublattices are quite decoupled and the ordering of the Fe
sublattice at 190 K does not influence the ordering of the Eu moments at
20 K. Thus, the ordering of the Eu spin moments is mainly due to Eu-Eu
interaction. In our Eu_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂ supercell, every other Eu site
is replaced by a nonmagnetic K¹⁺ ion. Although the influence of disorder
cannot be accessed this way, we try to get a rough estimate for the
reduction of the effective coupling comparing calculated total energies
for different Eu spin arrangements (aligned and antialigned Eu spins).
The difference in energy from these calculations is then mapped to a
Heisenberg model to obtain the value of the effective exchange constant
($J_{\rm eff}$). The value of the $J_{\rm eff}$ for the unsubstituted
and the 50

## IV Conclusion

To summarize, we have been successful in synthesizing a single phase
sample of Eu_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂. Our comprehensive investigation of the
electrical resistivity, ac and dc magnetic susceptibilities, and
specific heat shows the suppression of the SDW transition and evidence
for bulk type-II superconductivity below T_(c)=32 K. Substitution of 50

level.

order to compute the nonmagnetic electronic structure of
Eu_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂ relevant for the superconducting ground state, we
stabilized a self-consistent solution with negligible polarization at
the Fe sites by setting the initial spin split of Fe to zero. Both spin
channels have been added afterward for the comparison with the
unpolarized calculation in the case of Sr_(0.5)K_(0.5)Fe₂As₂.
