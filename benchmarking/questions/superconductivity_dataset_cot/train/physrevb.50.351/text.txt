A superconducting transition around 15-16 K is reported for metastable, as-melted ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C samples. Zero resistivity \(T_{c}\)(zero) was observed at 14.6 K with \(T_{c}\)(onset) around 16.5 K. A consistent diamagnetic \(T_{c}\) signal was observed around 14.8-15.6 K. The new superconducting phase was identified as isostructural to the quaternary LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type phase with tetragonal lattice parameters \(a=\)3.34 A and \(c=\)10.2 A. This superconducting phase is unstable due to the extremely small Sc\({}^{3+}\) ionic size, where the Sc atom is located in the cavity formed by the B-Ni-B-C network and no superconducting transition could be observed down to 5 K after 1050 degC annealing.

Superconducting intermetallic compounds with relatively high transition temperatures up to 23 K have been reported in \(R\) - _T_-B-C systems, where \(R\) = Y or rare earths and \(T\) = Ni, Pd, or Pt.1-5 In the nickel-based system, the superconducting phase has been identified as a quaternary LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type tetragonal structure with space group _14/mmm_. The structure is a three-dimensionally connected framework with LuC NaCl-type layers alternated with Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\), layers where nickel is tetrahedrally coordinated by four boron atoms.4 The phase formation was reported in _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (_R_ = Y, La, Ce, Sm, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, or Lu) with a maximum \(T_{c}\) of 16.6 K for nonmagnetic LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and a next-highest \(T_{c}\) of 15.6 K for nonmagnetic YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.1,3,4 For magnetic rare-earth compounds, a lower superconducting transition was observed for \(R\) = Ho, Er, and Tm, due to the magnetic pair-breaking effect.3 Here we report the discovery of a high-\(T_{c}\) metastable compound ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, which is isostructural to LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.

All _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (_R_ = Sc or Lu) samples were prepared by arc melting the high-purity elements (Sc and Lu: 99.9%; Ni: 99.999%; B: 99.9995%; and C: 99.999%) under an argon atmosphere in a Zr-gettered arc furnace. A two-stage procedure (_R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) + _C_) was utilized with negligible weight loss (less than 2%). Crystallographic data were obtained with a Rigaku Rotatlex rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer using Cu _K_\(\alpha\) radiation with a scanning rate of 1* in 2_th_ per minute. A Lazy Pulverix-PC program was employed for phase identification and lattice parameter calculation. Low-field magnetic measurements were made with either a Quantum Design MPMS superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (\(\geq\)20 G) or a MPMS2 (\(\leq\)20 G) SQUID magnetometer down to 5 K. ac electrical resistivity measurements (16 Hz) were carried out by the standard four-probe method in a RMC-Cryosystems closed-cycle refrigerator down to 7 K.

Powder x-ray diffraction data for all as-melted ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C samples show multiphase patterns. However, a pattern search indicates that the major phase can be indexed as the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type tetragonal structure (space group _14/mmm_), with lattice parameters \(a=\)3.34(1) A, \(c=\)10.2(1) A and unit-cell volume \(V\) = 114(1) A3. These values are smaller than \(a=\)3.464 A, \(c=\)10.63 A and \(V\) = 127.6 A3 for isostructural LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C due to the smaller Sc\({}^{3+}\) ionic radius of 0.732 A as compared with 0.85 A for the larger Lu\({}^{3+}\) ion.4

Two samples (_A_ and _B_) with better x-ray diffraction patterns were used for transport and magnetic measurements. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \(\rho(T)\) for the as-melted ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C sample \(A\) is shown in Fig. 1. Zero resistivity \(T_{c}\)(zero) was observed at 14.6 K, with the superconducting onset (1%) \(T_{c}\)(onset)

 around 16.5 K. The room-temperature resistivity is 82.8 _m_O cm, with a resistivity ratio _r_(_RT_)/_r_(20 K) of 2.33. Data for isostructural superconductor LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C are also included with _T_c(zero) at 16.7 K and _T_c(onset) around 17.6 K. The room-temperature resistivity is 41.2 _m_O cm, with a resistivity ratio _r_(_RT_)/_r_(20 K) of 4.43.

The low-temperature mass magnetic susceptibility _kh__g_(_T_) of the second as-melted ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C sample \(B\) is shown in Fig. 2 for both zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) measurements in a low applied field of 20 G. A diamagnetic superconducting transition signal was observed around 14.8 K for this sample. A large ZFC shielding signal of -6.7 x 10-3 emu/(g _G_) at 5 K for the bulk sample indicates that the bulk superconductivity effect (using the calculated x-ray density of 5.42 g/cm3). For the powdered sample (200 mesh), the diamagnetic shielding signal decreases to -1.7 x 10-3 emu/(g _G_) due to the multiphase nature of the as-melted sample.

The diamagnetic \(T_{c}\) transition is field independent in a low applied field of 5-50 G, but slightly sample dependent due to different arc-melting conditions. The highest diamagnetic \(T_{c}\) signal around 15.6 K for sample \(A\) was observed, as compared with 14.8 K for sample \(B\) (Fig. 3).

Contrary to the stable superconducting LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C phase, superconductivity in as-melted ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C samples is metastable. After annealing the samples at 1050degC in a sealed quartz tube (wrapped in Ta foil and then sealed under argon) for 24 h and water quenching, no superconducting transition can be observed down to 5 K from the low-temperature mass magnetic susceptibility _kh__g_(_T_) data (Fig. 4). The x-ray powder diffraction patterns for annealed samples show no trace of the tetragonal LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type phase, indicating that this superconducting tetragonal phase is entropy stabilized during the arc-melting process. Contrary to the weak, temperature-dependent, Pauli-like paramagnetic behavior of the annealed ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C sample [+9.1 x 10-6 emu/(g _G_) at 5 K], the annealed LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C bulk samples exhibits an excellent \(T_{c}\) transition of 16.7 K with a large and almost temperature-independent ZFC shielding signal of -2.62 x 10-2 emu/(g G) (x-ray density 8.49 g/cm3).

The entropy-stabilized or metastable tetragonal phase in ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is apparently closely related to the size effect. Since the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type phase is a variant on the ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\)-type structure with additional carbon in the Lu plane, the Lu atom is located in the cavity formed by the B-Ni-B-C network.4 After the substitution of small Lu ions by even smaller Sc, the structure is thus highly unstable and the phase exists only in the high-temperature, high-entropy region of the phase diagram, with an exceptionally small tetragonal \(c\) lattice parameter. Similar metastability due to the size effect was observed in many other superconducting systems. For example, in the _R_Ru\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) system, the metastable phase was observed for the 7.2-K ScRu\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) superconductor, as compared with the stable 2.1-K LuRu\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) superconductor.6 In the superconducting _R_Ir\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\) systems (_R_ = Ho, Er, or Tm), all superconducting ErRh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\)-type phases are metastable.7 The unstable 23-K Y-Pd-B-C phase2 is probably due to a similar origin, where the high-_T__c_ YPd\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type phase can be stabilized only with the off-stoichiometric composition of YPd\({}_{5}\)B\({}_{3}\)C\({}_{1-x}\).

The \(T_{c}\) of 15-16 K for the present metastable ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound is only slightly lower than 16.7 K for the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound, and almost equal to 15.6 K for the YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound (with a larger Y\({}^{3+}\) ionic radius of 0.893 A), which indicates that the superconducting properties in this system may be irrelevant to the relative size of nonmagnetic \(R\) 3+ ions (_R_ = Sc, Y, or Lu). Detailed studies of metastability, lattice parameter variation, and superconducting properties of the pseudo-quaternary (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system are in progress. Preliminary results indicate that the unstable boundary is near the Sc-rich region (_x_ > 0.5), with a stable \(T_{c}\) of 15.9 K for the (Lu\({}_{0.5}\)Sc\({}_{0.5}\))Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound. For the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound (_x_ = 1), a lower critical filed _H__c_1(15 K) of 70 G and an upper critical field _H__c_2(15 K) of 7 kG were observed from magnetization _M_(_H_) measurements for this type-II superconductor.
