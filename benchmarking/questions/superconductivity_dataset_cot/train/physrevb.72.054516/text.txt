###### Abstract

The superconductivity and the magnetism of Dy1-xTb\({}_{x}\)Ni2B2C (0.0 \(\approx\) \(x\) \(\leqslant\) 1.0) single crystals were studied. As Tb\({}^{+3}\) was substituted for Dy\({}^{+3}\), the superconducting transition temperature _T\({}_{c}\)_ decreased linearly at a rate of _dT\({}_{c}\)/dx_ = 12 K, and for \(x\) \(\geqslant\) 0.4, no superconductivity was observed above 2 K. In contrast, the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature _TN_ was almost constant for \(x\) \(\leqslant\) 0.6. These behaviors are in sharp contrast to the case of Dy1-xHo\({}_{x}\)Ni2B2C, where the _T\({}_{c}\)_ is constant for \(x\) \(<\) 0.7 but the _TN_ decreases linearly with \(x\). The difference between Dy1-xTb\({}_{x}\)Ni2B2C and Dy1-xHo\({}_{x}\)Ni2B2C can be understood if the magnetic structures of both compounds are properly considered.

## I Introduction

A family of superconductors, _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B2C (_R_ = rare-earth element, Y, and Lu), [1, 2, 3] shows many interesting features, such as the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism, [2, 3] the formation of a square vortex lattice, [4, 5] a large fluctuation effect, [6, 7, 8, 9] an upward curvature of the upper critical field, [10, 11] and anomalous optical properties. [12, 13] While the gap symmetry of this family of compounds was thought to be that of a fully gapped \(s\) wave, this issue was revisited recently, based on studies on the field-angle-dependent specific heat [14] and thermal conductivity, [15] and an anisotropic or nodal superconducting gap was proposed. This anisotropic or nodal superconducting gap was also found to coexist with nonlocal effects in LuNi2B2C, where a complex field-angle dependence of the specific heat appeared when the sample became disordered. [16] Among the issues surrounding this family of superconductors, [17] the interplay between magnetic ordering and superconductivity is quite interesting not only because the ranges of the superconducting and the antiferromagnetic (AF) critical temperatures _T\({}_{c}\)_ and _TN\({}_{x}\)_ are very wide but also because the configuration of the magnetic structure varies differently depending on \(R\). [18]

_R_Ni2B2C has a layered structure with a tetragonal symmetry, which consists of (Ni-B)2 and _R_-C layers along the \(c\) direction. Despite this layered structure, band structure calculations have showed that the electronic properties of these compounds are three dimensional. [19, 20] In addition, this family of compounds has a multiband character; the electrons in the Ni 3\(d\) band are major charge carriers and are the main contribution to the superconductivity, even though the contributions from other bands are not negligible.

The low-temperature magnetic structures of _R_Ni2B2C (Refs. [2] and [3]) have been studied in detail by using neutron scattering. [21] For example, as Fig. 1 shows, in the magnetically ordered state, the magnetic spins for \(R\) = Dy (Ho) align in the [110] direction ferromagnetically in the _ab_ plane but antiferromagnetically along the \(c\) direction. For \(R\) = Tb, however, the magnetic spins point along the \(a\) axis and form an _a_-axis-modulated ordered structure. This ordering of the magnetic spins of the _R_\({}^{+3}\) ions is mediated by the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which is an exchange interaction between the localized magnetic spins and the conduction electrons. The Neel temperatures _TN\({}_{N}\)_'s of the pure quaternary compounds for \(R\) from \(R\) = Tm to Gd are nearly proportional to the de Gennes factor dG = \((g_{J}-1)^{2}J(J+1)\), where _gJ_ is the Lande \(g\) factor, and \(J\) is the total angular momentum, which is determined by Hund's rules for the ground state of _R_\({}^{+3}\). The values of dG are 4.5, 7.1, and 10.5 for Ho\({}^{+3}\), Dy\({}^{+3}\), and Tb\({}^{+3}\), respectively and _TN_ increases in this order.

Since the magnetic moments perturb the singlet (spin up and spin down) Cooper pairs formed between the conduction electrons, the magnetic ion _R_\({}^{3+}\) suppresses the superconductivity. The pair-breaking effect due to exchange scattering by _uncorrelated_ local magnetic spins was theoretically considered by Abrikosov and Gor'kov (AG). [22] According to the AG theory, the _T\({}_{c}\)_ is rapidly suppressed with increasing dG;

Figure 1: Crystalline structure and magnetically ordered state of _R_Ni2B2C at low temperatures. The arrow on a \(R\) ion represents its magnetic spin. The magnetic ordering wave vector for the Tb case is indicated by **q**.

 i.e., \(dT_{c}/dx\!\propto\!-\!J_{sf}^{2}\)/dG, where \(x\) is the concentration of magnetic moments and \(J_{sf}\) is an exchange coupling constant between the local moments and the conduction electrons. In pure \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, where the magnetic elements \(R\) are located on regular lattice sites, the \(T_{c}\) decreases monotonically with increasing dG from \(R\!=\!\) Y, Lu to \(R\!=\!\) Dy.[18] It should be noted that in the case of \(R\!=\!\) Dy, superconductivity appears inside the magnetic order and in this case, AG theory is no longer valid. Also, for the alloy (\(R_{1-x}\)R\({}_{x}^{\prime}\))Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, the \(T_{c}\) is suppressed as the effective de Gennes factor, dG\({}_{eff}\)=(1\(-\)_x_) \(\times\) dG[\(R\)]+_x_ \(\times\) dG[\(R\)\({}^{\prime}\)], increases as long as the \(T_{c}\) is higher than the \(T_{N}\),[23] as is predicted by the AG theory. However, \(T_{c}/T_{c0}\) versus the dG factor for these compounds did not show a universal behavior. This breakdown of dG scaling originated from different crystalline electric field (CEF) effects of \(R^{3+}\) and different values of conduction electron-local moment coupling constant.[23]

de Gennes scaling of the \(T_{c}\) was also found to break down in the Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system when \(T_{N}\) was higher than \(T_{c}\).[23, 24] This anomalous behavior was not confined only to the Dy\(\!-\!\)Ho system. When nonmagnetic ions, such as Lu\({}^{+3}\) (Ref. [23]) and Y\({}^{+3}\) (Ref. [25]) are substituted for Dy\({}^{+3}\), the \(T_{c}\) is suppressed rapidly. On the other hand, as Ho\({}^{+3}\) replaces Dy\({}^{+3}\), the \(T_{N}\) of the Dy\(\!-\!\)Ho system decreases linearly with decreasing dG\({}_{eff}\), as expected. Y substitution for Tb has also been studied in detail.[26, 27]

To understand the above-mentioned phenomena more clearly, we prepared Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (Dy\(\!-\!\)Tb) single crystals, in which \(T_{c}\) was lower than \(T_{N}\). In that system, we found \(T_{c}\) and \(T_{N}\) behaviors that were strikingly different from those in the Dy\(\!-\!\)Ho system. In the Dy\(\!-\!\)Tb system, the \(T_{c}\) is depressed significantly by a small substitution of the magnetic ion Tb\({}^{+3}\) while the \(T_{N}\) does not change very much for \(x\!\approx\!0.6\). This is an unexpected result in view of the \(T_{c}\) and the \(T_{N}\) behaviors in the Dy\(\!-\!\)Ho system. We found that the different magnetic structures for Tb and Dy (or Ho) were very crucial to understanding the strange pair-breaking and magnetic ordering.

## II Experiment

Crystals of Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C were prepared for ten different nominal compositions from \(x\!=\!0.0\) to 1.0 by using a high-temperature metal flux of Ni\({}_{2}\)B, as has been described in detail elsewhere.[28] The crystal structure of each composition was confirmed to be tetragonal, like that of the two mother compounds, by using powder x-ray diffraction. The temperature- and field-dependent magnetizations, as well as the resistances, were measured using a commercial superconducting quantum interference magnetometer. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) data in the superconducting state were obtained on warming after a sample had been quenched.

## III Results and Discussion

The temperature-dependent static susceptibilities \(\chi\) of the Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds with \(x\!=\!0.05\), 0.1, and 0.25 under the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) condition for \({\bf H}\!\parallel\!{\bf c}\) are plotted in Fig. 2(a). To probe the superconducting transitions with the magnetic disturbances caused by the Dy\({}^{+3}\) and the Tb\({}^{+3}\) ions minimized, we applied a low magnetic field of 2 Oe along the \(c\) direction, which is the magnetic hard axis of these compounds. The 4 \(\pi\chi\) for \(x\!=\!0.05\) shows a typical superconducting diamagnetism, but the transition width \(\Delta T_{c}\) of 2 K from the onset of the diamagnetic signal to 90% of the value at 2 K is somewhat broad. The value of 4 \(\pi\chi\!\approx\!-\)4.6 at \(T\!=\!2\) K is larger than the 100% diamagnetic value due to the demagnetization effect. For \(x\!=\!0.25\), the data, even at \(T\!=\!2\) K, show that the samples are on the way to becoming superconductors with volume fractions of less than 100%, which indicates indirectly that the competition between superconductivity and magnetism exists. The \(T_{c}\) for each case was determined from the onset of diamagnetism and is designated by an arrow in Fig. 2(a). Substituting Tb for Dy in DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C surely weakens the superconductivity and reduces the \(T_{c}\). For the samples with \(x\!\approx\!0.4\), the superconductivity was totally destroyed, which was observed in the magnetization measurements and in the electric resistance measurements shown in Fig. 2(b). In the resistance measurements, the sudden change in the temperature dependence above \(T_{c}\) was found to originate from the AF ordering. The values of \(T_{c}\) determined from the resistance measurements are nearly the same as those determined from \(\chi\)(\(T)\).

Figure 2: (a) Static susceptibility of Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with \(x\) =0.05, 0.1, and 0.25 for \(H\!\parallel\!{\bf c}\) versus temperature in a zero-field-cooled warming condition. The arrows indicate the superconducting transition temperatures. (b) Normalized resistances of Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with \(x\)=0.05, 0.1, and 0.25 versus temperature. Because of the AF ordering, the resistances suddenly decrease at \(T\!=\!T_{N}\).

  Figure 3 shows the susceptibilities, \(\chi(T)\), for \(\bf H\perp c\) and \(H\)=10 Oe for different values of \(x\). The data for pure DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and TbNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C are also plotted for comparison. As the figure shows, the AF transitions manifest themselves with a clear deviation of \(\chi(T)\), near or above \(T\)=10 K, from the behavior at higher \(T\). The \(T_{N}\) was determined from the peak point of \(\chi(T)\). For \(x\)\(\,\leq\,\)0.25, the additional drops at lower temperatures are attributed to superconducting transitions. As \(x\) increases up to 0.4, the onset temperature of AF ordering is virtually unchanged, in spite of the increasing dG\({}_{eff}\). Instead, the transition becomes broad, and the suppression of \(\chi(T)\) below \(T_{N}\) is weakened. As \(x\) is increased further above 0.6, the magnetic transition becomes sharper and increases, approaching that of TbNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, as seen in Fig. 3(b). This results from the facts that the Tb\({}^{+3}\) ions participate more in the magnetic ordering and that the disturbance due to the Dy\({}^{+3}\) ions becomes small. The upturns of \(\chi(T)\) around 6 K for \(x\)=0.8 and 0.9 are thought to be due to the appearance of weak ferromagnetism, as in pure TbNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C around 8 K [29].

The variations of \(T_{c}\) and \(T_{N}\) versus dG\({}_{eff}\) in our Dy\(\,\)--Tb system, as well as in the previously reported Dy--Ho system, [18, 23] are presented in Fig. 4. dG\({}_{eff}\) is 7.083 for pure DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and that for Dy\(\,\)--Tb (Dy--Ho) is larger (smaller) than this value. For Dy\(\,\)--Ho, the \(T_{N}\) scales with dG\({}_{eff}\) fairly well, as the RKKY theory predicts. However, dG\({}_{eff}\) scaling breaks down for \(T_{c}\). The \(T_{c}\) is suppressed by increasing dG\({}_{eff}\) as predicted by the AG pair-breaking theory, only in the limited region where \(T_{c}\)\(>\)\(T_{N}\). The breakdown of this dG\({}_{eff}\) dependence suddenly shows up at the crossing point of \(T_{N}\) and \(T_{c}\); \(T_{c}\) drops sharply at that point and then becomes virtually constant as long as \(T_{c}\)\(<\)\(T_{N}\). This anomalous behavior is unprecedented in other magnetic superconductors.

The Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds studied in this work showed dG\({}_{eff}\) dependences for \(T_{c}\) and \(T_{N}\) that were totally different from those for Dy\(\,\)--Ho. Even a slight substitution in Dy\(\,\)--Tb suppresses the \(T_{c}\) severely while the \(T_{c}\) is robust for \(x\)\(\,\leq\,\)0.7 (dG\({}_{eff}\)\(\,\geq\,\)5.28) in Dy\(\,\)--Ho\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. The \(T_{c}\) of Dy\(\,\)--Tb decreases almost linearly with dG\({}_{eff}\), and its slope, \(dT_{c}/dx\), a parameter for magnetic pair breaking, is found to be \(-\)11.9\(\,\pm\,\)1.7 K. On the other hand, the \(T_{N}\) of Dy\(\,\)--Tb does not follow dG\({}_{eff}\) scaling. This is also in strong contrast to the Dy\(\,\)--Ho case. As \(x\) increases, the \(T_{N}\) of Dy\(\,\)--Tb, \(\sim\,\)10 K, remains almost unchanged up to \(x\)=0.6 (dG\({}_{eff}\)=9.13), and then increases rapidly to the value for values up to \(x\)=1.0.

A phenomenological model was suggested to elucidate the pair-breaking effect of Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. [30] In that model, the multiband \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system was assumed to have two superconducting order parameters (SOP); one was due to the Ni band, and the other was due to the other bands. In a paramagnetic state, both SOP's are suppressed as dG\({}_{eff}\) increases. However, in a magnetically ordered state, the SOP from the Ni band is affected very little by the local field due to the field cancellation effect at the Ni site because geometrically, Ni is thought to be located at the center of a tetrahedron of four nearest rare-earth ions in Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C as in the mother compounds DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (See the Ni ion with a cross mark in Fig. 1). In contrast, the SOP from the other bands is significantly suppressed. Therefore, the \(T_{c}\) is nearly constant for \(T_{c}\)\(<\)\(T_{N}\). This field cancellation effect below \(T_{N}\) was experimentally verified in a Mossbauer study, [31] where a local pair-breaking field was observed at the Ni sites in TbNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, but not in DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. On the same basis, the suppres

[16]\(T_{c}^{\rm res}\) was determined from the resistance measurements while \(T_{c}^{\rm mag}\) was determined from susceptibility measurements.

  sion of the \(T_{\rm c}\) in Dy--Lu by substitution of nonmagnetic ions, Lu\({}^{+3}\)[18, 23] can be easily understood. The substituted Lu\({}^{+3}\) does not work to cancel the field caused by Dy\({}^{+3}\), but works instead as a pair breaker.

The above picture can also be applied to the Dy--Tb system. When Tb\({}^{+3}\) is substituted, the \(R\) sites are occupied by the magnetic spins of Tb\({}^{+3}\), and in this case, the preferred spin direction of Tb\({}^{+3}\) ([100]) is different from that of Dy\({}^{+3}\) ([110]). Therefore, on Tb\({}^{+3}\) substitution, because of imperfect cancellation, the electrons at the Ni site start to feel the local field due to the magnetic spins, which decreases \(T_{\rm c}\); Tb\({}^{+3}\) plays the role of a magnetic pair breaker in the Dy--Tb system. This interpretation can also be confirmed by comparing the strengths of pair breaking in Dy--Tb and Dy--Lu. Since Lu\({}^{+3}\) is a magnetic-spin vacancy, the remaining field at the Ni site for Lu\({}^{+3}\) is estimated to be larger than that for Tb\({}^{+3}\); therefore, in DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, a Lu\({}^{+3}\) ion will act as a stronger pair breaker than a Tb\({}^{+3}\) ion. As expected, the \(T_{\rm c}\) suppression rate for Lu\({}^{+3}\) substitution, \(dT_{\rm c}/dx\!=\!-37\) K, is much larger than that for Tb\({}^{+3}\) substitution, \(dT_{\rm c}/dx\!=\!-12\) K.

The \(T_{N}\) of the Dy--Tb system does not follow de Gennes scaling, but this breakdown of de Gennes scaling is expected because DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and TbNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C have different magnetic ordering structure. The wave vector of the magnetic order of DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is \(Q\!=\!(0,0,2\pi)\) in the magnetic ground state, but that of TbNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is \(Q\!=\!(1.1\pi,0,0)\). These ground states of the two mother compounds will compete with each other in the Dy--Tb system. This competition or the change of magnetic structures can result in a breakdown of de Gennes scaling in \(T_{N}\). Possibly, for the Dy-rich side, the substitution of Tb increases dG, but randomizes the magnetic structure, which compensates for the increase in dG. Therefore, \(T_{N}\) does not change. In contrast, for the Tb-rich side, the substitution of Tb causes the overall magnetic structure to resemble that of TbNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. Thus, the detailed magnetic structures of Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C as a function of \(x\) must be determined, for example, by using neutron scattering experiments.

The above-mentioned scenario could also explain a nonmonotonic behavior of \(T_{N}\) in Er\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C polycrystalline samples.[32, 33] In this Er--Tb system, \(T_{N}\) remained almost constant for concentrations up to \(x\!=\!0.5\) but beyond this value, \(T_{N}\) increased rapidly. This behavior is very similar to that of the Dy--Tb system and therefore, the competition of magnetic ground states of the two mother compounds is also thought to play an important role in determining \(T_{N}\) in the Er--Tb system.

## IV Conclusion

We studied the superconductivity and the magnetism of a series of Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C single crystals for which the magnetic structures of the mother compounds were different from each other. The \(T_{c}(x)\) is suppressed rapidly by Tb substitution, but the \(T_{N}(x)\) is almost constant for \(x\!\approx\!0.6\). This is in strong contrast to the Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C case where the mother compounds have similar magnetic structures; the \(T_{c}(x)\) of Dy--Ho is virtually constant for \(x\!<\!0.7\), i.e., \(T_{c}\!<\!T_{N}\), and the \(T_{N}(x)\) follows de Gennes scaling well.

After comparing the three cases of \(R^{\prime}\) in Dy\({}_{1-x}R^{\prime}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, a nonmagnetic ion (Lu\({}^{+3}\)), a magnetic ion with similar spin anisotropy and magnetic ordering (Ho\({}^{+3}\)), and a magnetic ion with different anisotropy and magnetic ordering (Tb\({}^{+3}\)), we were able to present an explanation that could account for the superconductivities and the magnetisms of all three cases. The pair breaking or the \(T_{c}\) depression in Dy\({}_{1-x}R^{\prime}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C for \(T_{c}\!<\!T_{N}\) mainly originates from the uncanceled field at the Ni site as in Dy--Tb or Dy--Lu. In the determination of the \(T_{N}\) of a pseudoquaternary \(R_{1-x}R^{\prime}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, not only the de Gennes factor but also the magnetic ordering are crucial. When \(R\) and \(R^{\prime}\) elements having distinct magnetic ordering states in RNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, like Dy and Tb, are mixed, the \(T_{N}\) of \(R_{1-x}R^{\prime}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C cannot be estimated from only the change in the dG\({}_{eff}\).
