###### Abstract

Superconducting plasma along the c axis in the far-infrared region are observed in various high-_T__{c} cuprates including electron-doped and Bi cuprates. It is shown that the sphere resonance of the powder samples occurs near the frequency where the plasma along the c axis exists, since it is only sensitive to the _c_-axis dielectric constant in the far-infrared region due to the metal-like property in the _ab_ plane. This method provides an alternative to the reflectivity measurement of single crystals for investigating the plasma along the c axis. By measuring down to 7.5 cm^{-1}, the resonance is observed in Bi_{1.85}Pb_{0.35}Sr_{2.5}Ca_{2}Cu_{3.1}O_{y} , La_{1.85}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}. (Nd_{0.66}Sr_{0.205}Ce_{0.135}) CuO_{4} (7* phase), (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.40})_{2}Cu_{1.0}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3})_{0.9}, Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4}, and Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}. Among the Bi cuprates, however, no resonance is observed in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} and Bi_{2}Sr_{1.6}La_{0.4}CuO_{y} in this frequency region, which suggests that the resonance exists below 7.5 cm^{-1}. The resonance frequencies are discussed based on the Josephson-coupled layer model, and the _c_-axis penetration depth _k__{\alpha} are estimated from the resonance frequencies. It appears that _k__{\alpha} depends on the insulating nature of the barrier layer between CuO_{2} planes. Substitution effects on the resonance are also investigated in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})O_{4}, Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})O_{4}, and YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{3}O_{6+\delta}, and compared to the results of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{6+\delta}. Through the substitution, the resonance frequencies strongly decrease for all samples, indicating the strong increase of _k__{\alpha}. The frequency decrease in YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{3}O_{6+\delta} suggests that the resonance frequency is determined by the barrier at the (BaO)[Cu(1)O_{\delta}](BaO) chainy, not at the Y layer.

## I Introduction

One of the unique features in high-temperature copper oxide superconductors is the appearance of sharp reflectance edge along the c axis below _T__{c}, which is attributed to plasma excitation. To our knowledge, this feature was observed by both the transmission and reflectivity spectra of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} ceramics, which were wrongly interpreted as the superconducting gap.[1, 2] Bonn _et al._ interpreted the reflectance edge of ceramics as the plasma excitations without assigning its direction,[3] and then Noh _et al._ correctly interpreted the powder transmission peak as the plasma excitation along the c axis.[4, 5] The presence of the plasma excitation was widely recognized and established in 1992, when Tamasaku _et al._ directly measured the reflectivity along the c axis using the large La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} single crystals and confirmed the above interpretation.[6] Due to the large anisotropy of the materials, the frequencies of the plasma are in the far-infrared region, which are extremely low compared to the plasma frequencies along other directions and in conventional metals. Since they are smaller than the superconducting energy gap and optical-phonon frequencies, the plasma damping process is almost totally prohibited and the edges become sharp. This behavior provides useful information such as c-axis penetration depth, and many exotic electromagnetic phenomena have been predicted and some of them have been observed.[7, 8, 9, 10] For example, Matsuda _et al._ found a sharp microwave magnetoabsorption resonance in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} for **E**\parallel**B\parallel**c**, whose frequencies reduce as the magnetic field increases.[9] This behavior is also concerned with the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, since the absence of this edge above _T__{c} may be caused by the confinement mechanism.[11, 12] The plasma has been observed in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta}, and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[6, 13, 14] However, due to the limitation of the available sample size for the reflectivity measurement and the low-frequency limit of the infrared measurement, there are no reports of the observation of the plasma in other high-_T__{c} cuprates. For example, the _c_-axis reflectivity measurements of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y}, Tl_{2}Ba_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{10}, and La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} did not show the reflectance edge in the measured frequency region.[15, 16, 17]

In this paper, we show that the measurement of the sphere resonance of powder samples is an alternative to the reflectivity measurement of single crystals to observe the plasma along the c axis, since it is only sensitive to the _c_-axis dielectric constant in the far-infrared region. It is free from the limitation of sample size and the difficulty of crystal growth. Our measurements, extending down to 7.5 cm^{-1}, show the resonance in Bi_{1.85}Pb_{0.35}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3.1}O_{y}, La_{1.82}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, \rm{(Nd_{0.66}Sr_{0.205}Ce_{0.135})} CuO_{4}, (Ba_{0.96}Sr_{0.40})_{2}Cu_{1.0}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3})_{0.9}, Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4}, and Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}, but not in Bi_{2}Sr_{1.6}La_{0.4}CuO_{y} and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y}. Substitution effects on the resonance frequencies are also investigated.

## II Experimental

Ceramic samples were synthesized by conventional solid-state reactions. After multiple calcinations with intermediate grinding, the powders were pressed into pellets and sintered. The powder x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, and mag netic susceptibility measurements showed that the pellets had single phases, large Meissner signals and high transition temperatures comparable to the published data.[18, 19, 20] The transition temperatures determined by the midpoint of resistivity curves are summarized in Table 1. The oxygen contents of YBa2 [Cu1-_z_(Zn,Co),]3O6+_d_ were determined to be 6.66 +- 0.02 by iodometric measurements. For Bi2Sr2CaCu2O3, single crystals were used instead of ceramics. These pellets were ground into fine particles about ~ 2 _m_m in diameter, mixed with Teflon or polyethylene powder in a volume fraction f from 0.1 to 1% and pressed into pellets about 2 mm thick. Since the grain size of the ceramics before grinding were about 10 to 100 _m_m, we assume that most of the particles in the composite pellets were single crystals.

Transmission spectra were measured between 7.5 and 200 cm-1 using a rapid scan interferometer. Below 20 cm-1, a Si Bolometer operated at 1.5 K was used. Background spectrum were measured just before the sample spectrum measurement at each temperature, which were between 5 and 120 K. For each composition of the samples, samples measured in Teflon and polyethylene pellets were measured and it was confirmed that essentially the same resonance is observed in both samples.

## III Results and Discussion

Sphere resonance is the absorption of small particles in a host material and its analysis is the conventional way to investigate the phonon spectrum of a solid sample. As shown below, the resonance occurs at the frequency where \epsilon_{1c}(\omega) m - 2_em_ , where \epsilon_{1c}(\omega) is the real part of the c axis dielectric constant of the superconductor and \epsilon_{m}(\omega) is that of the host material. The resonance frequency is a little smaller than the sharp reflectivity edge along the c axis that occurs at \epsilon_{1c}(\omega)=0. The effective dielectric constant of the medium, \epsilon^{av}(\omega), including the isolated sphere anisotropic crystals, which are smaller than the wavelength, is calculated according to the relation

\[\frac{\epsilon^{av}(\omega)-\epsilon_{m}}{\epsilon^{av}(\omega)+2\,\epsilon_{m}} = \frac{f}{3}{\sum\limits_{i}}\frac{\epsilon_{i}(\omega)-\epsilon_{m}}{\epsilon_{i}(\omega)+2\,\epsilon_{m}},\]

where \epsilon_{i}(\omega) and f are the dielectric constants of a single crystal along the _i_th crystal axis and the volume fraction of the particles.[4, 5, 21] In the far-infrared region, since \epsilon_{m} is negligible compared to \epsilon_{1a}(\omega) and \epsilon_{1b}(\omega) in the high-_T_c cuprates, Eq. (1) becomes

\[\epsilon^{av}(\omega)=\epsilon_{m}\frac{(1+2f)\,\epsilon_{c}(\omega)+2(1+f)\,\epsilon_{m}}{(1-f)\,\epsilon_{c}(\omega)+(2-f)\,\epsilon_{m}}.\]

At \epsilon_{1c}(\omega) \approx - 2_em_ , the real part of the denominator of Eq. (2) becomes zero and sphere resonance occurs. The resonance determined by \epsilon_{a}(\omega) and \epsilon_{b}(\omega) have no effect in this frequency region, since they are shifted to the near-infrared region due to the metal-like property in these directions.

Figure 1 shows the absorption spectra of the media composed of La2-_z_Sr_xCuO4, YBa2Cu3O6,66, and YBa2Cu4O8particles in polyethylene. The low-temperature absorption peaks shift to higher frequencies as the doping increases, and shift to smaller frequencies and weaken as the temperature approaches _T_c. No peaks are observed in the normal state. The absorption peak frequencies and their temperature dependency correspond well to the changes in the point where \epsilon_{1c}(\omega) crosses zero, which is determined by the _c_-axis reflectivity measurement of single crystals.[6, 13, 14] These observations confirm that the absorption peaks of the medium are determined by \epsilon_{c}(\omega) \approx - 2_em_  and the plasma resonance along the c axis can be observed by this method.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Chemical formula & _T_c (K) & _ω_peak (5 K)(cm−1) & _λc_c (5 K) (_μ_m) \\ Bi1.85Pb0.35Sr2Ca2Cu3.1O_y_ & 107 & 17.0 & 23 (_ε__s_ = 12) \\ La1.82Ca1.85Cu2O6+_δ_ & 52 & 22.0 & 15 (_ε__s_ = 20) \\ (Nd0.66Sr0.205Ca0.13)2CuO4 & 24 & 12.0 & 29 (_ε__s_ = 17) \\ (Ba0.85Sr0.4)2Cu1.1O22+_δ_(CO3)0.9 & 35 & 38.5 & 8 (_ε__s_ = 20) \\ Pr1.85Ca0.15CuO  It is interesting to compare this method with the reflectivity measurement of ceramic samples. The strong edge in the far-infrared region below T_{c} has also been reported in the reflectivity measurement of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} ceramic samples.[32, 23] If the spectra can be analyzed by a short-wavelength approximation, it may be possible to assign that the edge comes from the plasma along c axis. However, since the grain size of the ceramic is comparable to the wavelength, we can neither apply the short-wavelength approximation nor long-wavelength effective-medium approximation. In this case, the low-frequency reflectivity depends on the grain size, _ab_ plane, and c-axis contribution, and it is quite difficult to deduce a c-axis response from the spectra. In contrast to the reflectivity measurements of ceramics, the present method can determine the plasma along the c axis unambiguously. Since the size of the particles in the composite pellet is about 2 \mum, we can apply the long-wavelength electrostatic approximation. In this approximation, the _ab_-plane contribution has no effect in the far-infrared region, as shown above.

Figures 2(a)-2(f) show the absorption coefficients of mediums composed of Bi_{1.85}Pb_{0.35}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3.1}O_{y} , La_{1.85}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, (Nd_{0.66}Sr_{0.205}Ce_{0.135}) _{2}CuO_{4}, (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.40}) _{2}Cu_{1.1}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9}. Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4}, and Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} particles in polyethylene. All of them show peaks below T_{c} , and the peaks shift to higher frequencies as the temperature decreases. These changes are the same as those observed for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.66}, YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, and confirm that the peaks are plasma resonance along the c axis. The appearance of plasma in the superconducting state and the absence of it in the normal state seem a common feature of most high-T_{c} cuprates.

In Fig. 2, the peaks of La_{1.82}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} and (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.44}) _{2}Cu_{1.1}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9} are broad compared to the others. This suggests the existence of unpaired carriers below T_{c} in these materials, which is also seen in La_{1.8}Sr_{0.2}CuO_{4} in Fig. 1(a). The reflectivity measurement of La_{1.8}Sr_{0.2}CuO_{4} single crystal has revealed that the existence of the unpaired carriers is intrinsic in highly doped cuprates, which was explained by the electrical phase separation, not by the effect of strong disorder or by an anisotropic gap.[24] In the present experiment, however, it seems that the broadenings are mainly due to sample inhomogeneity rather than the above explanation, since it is difficult to make good samples of La_{1.85}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} and (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.44}) _{2}Cu_{1.1}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9}.[18, 19]

If we neglect the unpaired carriers in the superconducting states, the low-frequency dielectric function of the superconductor can be written as \epsilon_{1c}(\omega)=\epsilon_{\infty}-\omega_{ps}^{2}/\omega^{2}, where \epsilon_{\infty} and \omega_{ps} are the high-frequency dielectric constant and plasma frequency of the condensed carrier. In this approximation, the London penetration depth \lambda_{c} becomes

\[\lambda_{c}=\frac{c}{\omega_{ps}}=\frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{\infty}+2\,\epsilon _{m}}\omega_{\rm peak}}.\] (3)

So \lambda_{c} can be calculated from the peak frequency \omega_{\rm peak} and \epsilon_{\infty} . \epsilon_{\infty} can be estimated by the single-crystal value of the materials for Pr_{2}CuO_{4}, Nd_{2}CuO_{4},[25] and \epsilon_{\infty} is assumed to be 17 for (Nd_{0.66}Sr_{0.205}Ce_{0.135}) _{2}CuO_{4}, 20 for La_{1.85}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} and (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.44}) _{2}Cu_{1.1}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9}, and 12 for Bi_{1.85}Pb_{0.35}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3.1}O_{y}. Table 1 summarizes the peak frequencies and penetration depths for these compounds. It is clear that \lambda_{c} depends on the insulating nature of the buffer layer between CuO_{2} planes: it becomes progressively shorter for (Pr, Ce)_{2}O_{2}, Nd_{2}O_{2}, (Ba_{0.55}Sr_{0.45}) _{2}Cu_{0.1}O_{0.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9}, (La, Sr)_{2}O_{2} layers, which is the same order in which c-axis resistivity decreases.[26] It is known that \lambda_{c}^{2} is proportional to \rho_{c} and \Delta^{-1} in the Josephson-coupled layer model along the c axis, where \rho_{c} and \Delta are the c-axis resistivity and gap value, respectively.[14, 27] Our result shows that the model qualitatively explains the \rho_{c} dependence of \lambda_{c} in the present single-layered high-T_{c} cuprates, so it is used as the basis for the following discussion.

  It has been reported that the _c_-axis reflectivity of Bi2212 is essentially independent of temperature in a frequency range down to 30 cm -1.15 We also measured the absorption coefficients of mediums composed of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O3 (_Tc__c_ = 88 K) and Bi2Sr1.6La0.4CuO3 (_Tc__c_ = 28 K) particles in polyethylene. As shown in Figs. 2(g) and 2(h), they show no remarkable changes down to 7.5 cm -1. However, the decrease of the absorption coefficients in the superconducting state in this frequency region suggests that peaks exist below 7.5 cm -1. The difference in the plasma frequency among Bi2201, Bi2212, and Bi2223 can be explained by the larger anisotropy of Bi2201 and Bi2212 compared to Bi2223: the anisotropy parameter determined from the upper critical field in Bi2212 is 50-140, which is much larger than that of Bi2223, which is 31.26 From this difference, it is roughly estimated that the plasma of Bi2212 may exist between 4 to 10 cm -1, which is difficult to measure in the present experiment.28,29 This is consistent with the results of the microwave absorption experiment under magnetic field, which predicts that the plasma of Bi2212 exists at 5.5 cm -1 at zero magnetic field.10 The same explanation also applies to the Bi2201 case.

In Figs. 3(a)-3(e), the effects of Zn substitution on the resonance in La2-_x_Sr_(Cu1-_Zn_)O4, Nd1.8Sc0.15(Cu1-_Zn_)O4, and YBa2(Cu1-_Zn_)3O6+_d_ are summarized. For unsubstituted Nd1.8Sc0.15CuO4, essentially the same resonance has been reported previously.5 Through Zn substitution, the resonance frequencies strongly decrease for all samples. Fukuzumi _et al._ found a similar strong shift for the reflectivity measurements of YBa2(Cu1-_Zn_)3O6.63 single crystals, and explained the shift as follows:30 In the Josephson-coupled layer model, the plasma frequency is proportional to \rho_{c}^{-1/2} and \Delta^{1/2} as discussed above. Assuming that \Delta - const and taking the temperature-dependent value of \rho_{c} just above T_{c} , the strong shift of the plasma frequencies can be explained by the increase of \rho_{c} through Zn substitution, since \rho_{c} shows semiconducting behavior (d\rho_{c}_d_T_ < 0) and follows the same line for all Zn concentrations (_z_  0.02). Although we cannot measure \rho_{c} in the experiment, the strong shift of the plasma frequencies through substitution also seems to be explained by the increase of \rho_{c} . In this case, the increase of \rho_{c} may be due to the increase in the residual resistivity and/or the semi-conductive temperature dependence of the sample.

There seem to be two Josephson junctions along the c axis in YBa2Cu3O6.66: one at the (BaO)[Cu(1)O_d_](BaO) chain layer and the other at the Y layer. So, it would be interesting to know which junction determines the plasma frequency. Figure 3(f) shows the absorption of YBa2(Cu1-_Tc_)3O6.66. It also shows a strong frequency decreases through Co substitution, which suggests that the above explanation may be applicable to this case. In this case, the increase of \rho_{c} may be due to an increase of junction resistivity at the (BaO)[Cu(1)O_d_](BaO) chain layer, since Co substitutes primarily the chain copper site Cu(1). This indicates that the junction that determines the plasma frequency is at the chain layer, not at the Y layer. If the latter junction determined the plasma frequency, a small frequency shift corresponding to the slight _Tc_ reduction would occur, since the junction resistivity does not change through Co substitution.

In summary, we showed that the measurement of sphere resonance is an easy way to determine the plasma along the c axis, and found that the resonance exists in Bi1.8SpPb0.3Sr2Ca2Cu3.1Oy , La1.82Ca1.18Cu2O6+_d_, (Nd0.66Sr0.205Ce0.135) 2CuO4, (Ba0.56Sr0.44) 2Cu1.1O2.2+_d_(CO3)0.9, Pr1.8Sc0.15CuO4, and Nd2CuO4-_F_x_. \lambda_{c} was estimated from the resonance frequencies. No resonance was observed in Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy and Bi2Sr1.6La0.4CuO3 ; it may exist below 7.5 cm -1. A strong plasma frequency decrease was observed through Zn and Co substitution, and was discussed on the basis of the Josephson-coupled layer model. From the analysis, it was found that the chain layer determines the junction resistivity in the model.

###### Abstract

Superconducting plasma along the c axis in the far-infrared region are observed in various high-_T__{c} cuprates including electron-doped and Bi cuprates. It is shown that the sphere resonance of the powder samples occurs near the frequency where the plasma along the c axis exists, since it is only sensitive to the _c_-axis dielectric constant in the far-infrared region due to the metal-like property in the _ab_ plane. This method provides an alternative to the reflectivity measurement of single crystals for investigating the plasma along the c axis. By measuring down to 7.5 cm^{-1}, the resonance is observed in Bi_{1.85}Pb_{0.35}Sr_{2.5}Ca_{2}Cu_{3.1}O_{y} , La_{1.85}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}. (Nd_{0.66}Sr_{0.205}Ce_{0.135}) CuO_{4} (7* phase), (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.40})_{2}Cu_{1.0}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3})_{0.9}, Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4}, and Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}. Among the Bi cuprates, however, no resonance is observed in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} and Bi_{2}Sr_{1.6}La_{0.4}CuO_{y} in this frequency region, which suggests that the resonance exists below 7.5 cm^{-1}. The resonance frequencies are discussed based on the Josephson-coupled layer model, and the _c_-axis penetration depth _k__{\alpha} are estimated from the resonance frequencies. It appears that _k__{\alpha} depends on the insulating nature of the barrier layer between CuO_{2} planes. Substitution effects on the resonance are also investigated in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})O_{4}, Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})O_{4}, and YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{3}O_{6+\delta}, and compared to the results of YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{6+\delta}. Through the substitution, the resonance frequencies strongly decrease for all samples, indicating the strong increase of _k__{\alpha}. The frequency decrease in YBa_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{3}O_{6+\delta} suggests that the resonance frequency is determined by the barrier at the (BaO)[Cu(1)O_{\delta}](BaO) chainy, not at the Y layer.

## I Introduction

One of the unique features in high-temperature copper oxide superconductors is the appearance of sharp reflectance edge along the c axis below _T__{c}, which is attributed to plasma excitation. To our knowledge, this feature was observed by both the transmission and reflectivity spectra of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} ceramics, which were wrongly interpreted as the superconducting gap.[1, 2] Bonn _et al._ interpreted the reflectance edge of ceramics as the plasma excitations without assigning its direction,[3] and then Noh _et al._ correctly interpreted the powder transmission peak as the plasma excitation along the c axis.[4, 5] The presence of the plasma excitation was widely recognized and established in 1992, when Tamasaku _et al._ directly measured the reflectivity along the c axis using the large La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} single crystals and confirmed the above interpretation.[6] Due to the large anisotropy of the materials, the frequencies of the plasma are in the far-infrared region, which are extremely low compared to the plasma frequencies along other directions and in conventional metals. Since they are smaller than the superconducting energy gap and optical-phonon frequencies, the plasma damping process is almost totally prohibited and the edges become sharp. This behavior provides useful information such as c-axis penetration depth, and many exotic electromagnetic phenomena have been predicted and some of them have been observed.[7, 8, 9, 10] For example, Matsuda _et al._ found a sharp microwave magnetoabsorption resonance in Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y} for **E**\parallel**B\parallel**c**, whose frequencies reduce as the magnetic field increases.[9] This behavior is also concerned with the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity, since the absence of this edge above _T__{c} may be caused by the confinement mechanism.[11, 12] The plasma has been observed in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+\delta}, and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}.[6, 13, 14] However, due to the limitation of the available sample size for the reflectivity measurement and the low-frequency limit of the infrared measurement, there are no reports of the observation of the plasma in other high-_T__{c} cuprates. For example, the _c_-axis reflectivity measurements of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y}, Tl_{2}Ba_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{10}, and La_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} did not show the reflectance edge in the measured frequency region.[15, 16, 17]

In this paper, we show that the measurement of the sphere resonance of powder samples is an alternative to the reflectivity measurement of single crystals to observe the plasma along the c axis, since it is only sensitive to the _c_-axis dielectric constant in the far-infrared region. It is free from the limitation of sample size and the difficulty of crystal growth. Our measurements, extending down to 7.5 cm^{-1}, show the resonance in Bi_{1.85}Pb_{0.35}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3.1}O_{y}, La_{1.82}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, \rm{(Nd_{0.66}Sr_{0.205}Ce_{0.135})} CuO_{4}, (Ba_{0.96}Sr_{0.40})_{2}Cu_{1.0}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3})_{0.9}, Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4}, and Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x}, but not in Bi_{2}Sr_{1.6}La_{0.4}CuO_{y} and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{y}. Substitution effects on the resonance frequencies are also investigated.

## II Experimental

Ceramic samples were synthesized by conventional solid-state reactions. After multiple calcinations with intermediate grinding, the powders were pressed into pellets and sintered. The powder x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, and mag netic susceptibility measurements showed that the pellets had single phases, large Meissner signals and high transition temperatures comparable to the published data.[18, 19, 20] The transition temperatures determined by the midpoint of resistivity curves are summarized in Table 1. The oxygen contents of YBa2 [Cu1-_z_(Zn,Co),]3O6+_d_ were determined to be 6.66 +- 0.02 by iodometric measurements. For Bi2Sr2CaCu2O3, single crystals were used instead of ceramics. These pellets were ground into fine particles about ~ 2 _m_m in diameter, mixed with Teflon or polyethylene powder in a volume fraction f from 0.1 to 1% and pressed into pellets about 2 mm thick. Since the grain size of the ceramics before grinding were about 10 to 100 _m_m, we assume that most of the particles in the composite pellets were single crystals.

Transmission spectra were measured between 7.5 and 200 cm-1 using a rapid scan interferometer. Below 20 cm-1, a Si Bolometer operated at 1.5 K was used. Background spectrum were measured just before the sample spectrum measurement at each temperature, which were between 5 and 120 K. For each composition of the samples, samples measured in Teflon and polyethylene pellets were measured and it was confirmed that essentially the same resonance is observed in both samples.

## III Results and Discussion

Sphere resonance is the absorption of small particles in a host material and its analysis is the conventional way to investigate the phonon spectrum of a solid sample. As shown below, the resonance occurs at the frequency where \epsilon_{1c}(\omega) m - 2_em_ , where \epsilon_{1c}(\omega) is the real part of the c axis dielectric constant of the superconductor and \epsilon_{m}(\omega) is that of the host material. The resonance frequency is a little smaller than the sharp reflectivity edge along the c axis that occurs at \epsilon_{1c}(\omega)=0. The effective dielectric constant of the medium, \epsilon^{av}(\omega), including the isolated sphere anisotropic crystals, which are smaller than the wavelength, is calculated according to the relation

\[\frac{\epsilon^{av}(\omega)-\epsilon_{m}}{\epsilon^{av}(\omega)+2\,\epsilon_{m}} = \frac{f}{3}{\sum\limits_{i}}\frac{\epsilon_{i}(\omega)-\epsilon_{m}}{\epsilon_{i}(\omega)+2\,\epsilon_{m}},\]

where \epsilon_{i}(\omega) and f are the dielectric constants of a single crystal along the _i_th crystal axis and the volume fraction of the particles.[4, 5, 21] In the far-infrared region, since \epsilon_{m} is negligible compared to \epsilon_{1a}(\omega) and \epsilon_{1b}(\omega) in the high-_T_c cuprates, Eq. (1) becomes

\[\epsilon^{av}(\omega)=\epsilon_{m}\frac{(1+2f)\,\epsilon_{c}(\omega)+2(1+f)\,\epsilon_{m}}{(1-f)\,\epsilon_{c}(\omega)+(2-f)\,\epsilon_{m}}.\]

At \epsilon_{1c}(\omega) \approx - 2_em_ , the real part of the denominator of Eq. (2) becomes zero and sphere resonance occurs. The resonance determined by \epsilon_{a}(\omega) and \epsilon_{b}(\omega) have no effect in this frequency region, since they are shifted to the near-infrared region due to the metal-like property in these directions.

Figure 1 shows the absorption spectra of the media composed of La2-_z_Sr_xCuO4, YBa2Cu3O6,66, and YBa2Cu4O8particles in polyethylene. The low-temperature absorption peaks shift to higher frequencies as the doping increases, and shift to smaller frequencies and weaken as the temperature approaches _T_c. No peaks are observed in the normal state. The absorption peak frequencies and their temperature dependency correspond well to the changes in the point where \epsilon_{1c}(\omega) crosses zero, which is determined by the _c_-axis reflectivity measurement of single crystals.[6, 13, 14] These observations confirm that the absorption peaks of the medium are determined by \epsilon_{c}(\omega) \approx - 2_em_  and the plasma resonance along the c axis can be observed by this method.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} Chemical formula & _T_c (K) & _ω_peak (5 K)(cm−1) & _λc_c (5 K) (_μ_m) \\ Bi1.85Pb0.35Sr2Ca2Cu3.1O_y_ & 107 & 17.0 & 23 (_ε__s_ = 12) \\ La1.82Ca1.85Cu2O6+_δ_ & 52 & 22.0 & 15 (_ε__s_ = 20) \\ (Nd0.66Sr0.205Ca0.13)2CuO4 & 24 & 12.0 & 29 (_ε__s_ = 17) \\ (Ba0.85Sr0.4)2Cu1.1O22+_δ_(CO3)0.9 & 35 & 38.5 & 8 (_ε__s_ = 20) \\ Pr1.85Ca0.15CuO  It is interesting to compare this method with the reflectivity measurement of ceramic samples. The strong edge in the far-infrared region below T_{c} has also been reported in the reflectivity measurement of La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} ceramic samples.[32, 23] If the spectra can be analyzed by a short-wavelength approximation, it may be possible to assign that the edge comes from the plasma along c axis. However, since the grain size of the ceramic is comparable to the wavelength, we can neither apply the short-wavelength approximation nor long-wavelength effective-medium approximation. In this case, the low-frequency reflectivity depends on the grain size, _ab_ plane, and c-axis contribution, and it is quite difficult to deduce a c-axis response from the spectra. In contrast to the reflectivity measurements of ceramics, the present method can determine the plasma along the c axis unambiguously. Since the size of the particles in the composite pellet is about 2 \mum, we can apply the long-wavelength electrostatic approximation. In this approximation, the _ab_-plane contribution has no effect in the far-infrared region, as shown above.

Figures 2(a)-2(f) show the absorption coefficients of mediums composed of Bi_{1.85}Pb_{0.35}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3.1}O_{y} , La_{1.85}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, (Nd_{0.66}Sr_{0.205}Ce_{0.135}) _{2}CuO_{4}, (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.40}) _{2}Cu_{1.1}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9}. Pr_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4}, and Nd_{2}CuO_{4-x}F_{x} particles in polyethylene. All of them show peaks below T_{c} , and the peaks shift to higher frequencies as the temperature decreases. These changes are the same as those observed for La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.66}, YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8}, and confirm that the peaks are plasma resonance along the c axis. The appearance of plasma in the superconducting state and the absence of it in the normal state seem a common feature of most high-T_{c} cuprates.

In Fig. 2, the peaks of La_{1.82}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} and (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.44}) _{2}Cu_{1.1}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9} are broad compared to the others. This suggests the existence of unpaired carriers below T_{c} in these materials, which is also seen in La_{1.8}Sr_{0.2}CuO_{4} in Fig. 1(a). The reflectivity measurement of La_{1.8}Sr_{0.2}CuO_{4} single crystal has revealed that the existence of the unpaired carriers is intrinsic in highly doped cuprates, which was explained by the electrical phase separation, not by the effect of strong disorder or by an anisotropic gap.[24] In the present experiment, however, it seems that the broadenings are mainly due to sample inhomogeneity rather than the above explanation, since it is difficult to make good samples of La_{1.85}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} and (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.44}) _{2}Cu_{1.1}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9}.[18, 19]

If we neglect the unpaired carriers in the superconducting states, the low-frequency dielectric function of the superconductor can be written as \epsilon_{1c}(\omega)=\epsilon_{\infty}-\omega_{ps}^{2}/\omega^{2}, where \epsilon_{\infty} and \omega_{ps} are the high-frequency dielectric constant and plasma frequency of the condensed carrier. In this approximation, the London penetration depth \lambda_{c} becomes

\[\lambda_{c}=\frac{c}{\omega_{ps}}=\frac{c}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{\infty}+2\,\epsilon _{m}}\omega_{\rm peak}}.\] (3)

So \lambda_{c} can be calculated from the peak frequency \omega_{\rm peak} and \epsilon_{\infty} . \epsilon_{\infty} can be estimated by the single-crystal value of the materials for Pr_{2}CuO_{4}, Nd_{2}CuO_{4},[25] and \epsilon_{\infty} is assumed to be 17 for (Nd_{0.66}Sr_{0.205}Ce_{0.135}) _{2}CuO_{4}, 20 for La_{1.85}Ca_{1.18}Cu_{2}O_{6+\delta} and (Ba_{0.56}Sr_{0.44}) _{2}Cu_{1.1}O_{2.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9}, and 12 for Bi_{1.85}Pb_{0.35}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3.1}O_{y}. Table 1 summarizes the peak frequencies and penetration depths for these compounds. It is clear that \lambda_{c} depends on the insulating nature of the buffer layer between CuO_{2} planes: it becomes progressively shorter for (Pr, Ce)_{2}O_{2}, Nd_{2}O_{2}, (Ba_{0.55}Sr_{0.45}) _{2}Cu_{0.1}O_{0.2+\delta}(CO_{3}) _{0.9}, (La, Sr)_{2}O_{2} layers, which is the same order in which c-axis resistivity decreases.[26] It is known that \lambda_{c}^{2} is proportional to \rho_{c} and \Delta^{-1} in the Josephson-coupled layer model along the c axis, where \rho_{c} and \Delta are the c-axis resistivity and gap value, respectively.[14, 27] Our result shows that the model qualitatively explains the \rho_{c} dependence of \lambda_{c} in the present single-layered high-T_{c} cuprates, so it is used as the basis for the following discussion.

  It has been reported that the _c_-axis reflectivity of Bi2212 is essentially independent of temperature in a frequency range down to 30 cm -1.15 We also measured the absorption coefficients of mediums composed of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O3 (_Tc__c_ = 88 K) and Bi2Sr1.6La0.4CuO3 (_Tc__c_ = 28 K) particles in polyethylene. As shown in Figs. 2(g) and 2(h), they show no remarkable changes down to 7.5 cm -1. However, the decrease of the absorption coefficients in the superconducting state in this frequency region suggests that peaks exist below 7.5 cm -1. The difference in the plasma frequency among Bi2201, Bi2212, and Bi2223 can be explained by the larger anisotropy of Bi2201 and Bi2212 compared to Bi2223: the anisotropy parameter determined from the upper critical field in Bi2212 is 50-140, which is much larger than that of Bi2223, which is 31.26 From this difference, it is roughly estimated that the plasma of Bi2212 may exist between 4 to 10 cm -1, which is difficult to measure in the present experiment.28,29 This is consistent with the results of the microwave absorption experiment under magnetic field, which predicts that the plasma of Bi2212 exists at 5.5 cm -1 at zero magnetic field.10 The same explanation also applies to the Bi2201 case.

In Figs. 3(a)-3(e), the effects of Zn substitution on the resonance in La2-_x_Sr_(Cu1-_Zn_)O4, Nd1.8Sc0.15(Cu1-_Zn_)O4, and YBa2(Cu1-_Zn_)3O6+_d_ are summarized. For unsubstituted Nd1.8Sc0.15CuO4, essentially the same resonance has been reported previously.5 Through Zn substitution, the resonance frequencies strongly decrease for all samples. Fukuzumi _et al._ found a similar strong shift for the reflectivity measurements of YBa2(Cu1-_Zn_)3O6.63 single crystals, and explained the shift as follows:30 In the Josephson-coupled layer model, the plasma frequency is proportional to \rho_{c}^{-1/2} and \Delta^{1/2} as discussed above. Assuming that \Delta - const and taking the temperature-dependent value of \rho_{c} just above T_{c} , the strong shift of the plasma frequencies can be explained by the increase of \rho_{c} through Zn substitution, since \rho_{c} shows semiconducting behavior (d\rho_{c}_d_T_ < 0) and follows the same line for all Zn concentrations (_z_  0.02). Although we cannot measure \rho_{c} in the experiment, the strong shift of the plasma frequencies through substitution also seems to be explained by the increase of \rho_{c} . In this case, the increase of \rho_{c} may be due to the increase in the residual resistivity and/or the semi-conductive temperature dependence of the sample.

There seem to be two Josephson junctions along the c axis in YBa2Cu3O6.66: one at the (BaO)[Cu(1)O_d_](BaO) chain layer and the other at the Y layer. So, it would be interesting to know which junction determines the plasma frequency. Figure 3(f) shows the absorption of YBa2(Cu1-_Tc_)3O6.66. It also shows a strong frequency decreases through Co substitution, which suggests that the above explanation may be applicable to this case. In this case, the increase of \rho_{c} may be due to an increase of junction resistivity at the (BaO)[Cu(1)O_d_](BaO) chain layer, since Co substitutes primarily the chain copper site Cu(1). This indicates that the junction that determines the plasma frequency is at the chain layer, not at the Y layer. If the latter junction determined the plasma frequency, a small frequency shift corresponding to the slight _Tc_ reduction would occur, since the junction resistivity does not change through Co substitution.

In summary, we showed that the measurement of sphere resonance is an easy way to determine the plasma along the c axis, and found that the resonance exists in Bi1.8SpPb0.3Sr2Ca2Cu3.1Oy , La1.82Ca1.18Cu2O6+_d_, (Nd0.66Sr0.205Ce0.135) 2CuO4, (Ba0.56Sr0.44) 2Cu1.1O2.2+_d_(CO3)0.9, Pr1.8Sc0.15CuO4, and Nd2CuO4-_F_x_. \lambda_{c} was estimated from the resonance frequencies. No resonance was observed in Bi2Sr2CaCu2Oy and Bi2Sr1.6La0.4CuO3 ; it may exist below 7.5 cm -1. A strong plasma frequency decrease was observed through Zn and Co substitution, and was discussed on the basis of the Josephson-coupled layer model. From the analysis, it was found that the chain layer determines the junction resistivity in the model.
