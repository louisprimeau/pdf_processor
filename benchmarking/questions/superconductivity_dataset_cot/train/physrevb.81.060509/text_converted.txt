###### Abstract

The temperature-dependent optical reflectivity and complex
transmissivity of an epitaxially grown Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂ thin
film were measured over a wide frequency range (4-35 000 cm⁻¹). The
opening of the superconducting gap 2A₀=(3.7 ± 0.3) meV is _directly_
observed by vanishing optical conductivity at 30 cm⁻¹ for T<T_(c)=20 K.
While in this range the measured temperature- and frequency-dependent
electrodynamic properties agree well with the BCS predictions of a
nodeless order parameter, unexpectedly a strong quasiparticle absorption
shows up below 1.5 meV. The spectral weight of the condensate 1.94×10⁷
cm⁻² corresponds to a penetration depth λ=3600 A.

## I Introduction

Soon after the discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictides,[1] the
epitaxial growth of LaFeAsO films was reported[2, 3] and
superconductivity observed in thin films of Co-doped SrFe₂As₂.[4, 5] By
now the homogeneity of the films and the upper critical field have
increased to make iron pnictides interesting for technological
applications.[6, 7, 8] In particular cobalt-doped BaFe₂As₂ seems to be
suitable for producing high-quality thin films which are stable in
air,[8] can be template engineered,[9] or tuned in T_(c) by epitaxial
growths of strained films.[10]

Besides potential applications, thin films are advantageous for
investigations of fundamental problems due to their large area, in
particular if single crystals of sufficient quality, homogeneity, and
size are limited. As far as optical experiments are concerned, only thin
films give the opportunity to perform transmission measurements and in
this way be much more sensitive to probe the electrodynamic properties
of the normal and superconducting states.[11, 12] Issues such as the
spectral weight distribution, the universal conductivity background, and
in particular on the superconducting gaps, on states in the gap, nodes
in the order parameter and quasiparticle relaxation are addressed by our
optical experiments on Ba-(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂ thin films.

## II Experimental details and results

Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(y))₂As₂ films were deposited on a (001)-oriented
(La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O₃ substrate by pulsed laser deposition, where the
Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂ target was ablated with 248 nm
K$\ddot{\mathrm{e}}$r radiation under UHV conditions.[10] The films grow
with a very smooth surface of an rms roughness better than 12 nm, as
measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The film thickness was
monitored _in situ_ by a quartz balance, and finally measured by AFM and
ellipsometry to be d = 90 nm. The phase purity was checked by x-ray and
EDS. Standard four-probe method was utilized to measure the dc
resistivity and determine the superconducting transition: from the onset
at 22 K with a transition width of 2 K, we have chosen T_(c)=20 K (inset
of Fig. 1). The absolute value and temperature dependence of ρ(_T_) is
very similar to results obtained on single crystals.[13]

Using different optical methods, we performed experiments in the
frequency range from 4 to 35 000 cm⁻¹ and at various temperatures down
to 5 K. In the THz range (4 to 40 cm⁻¹) the complex transmissivity
(transmission amplitude and phase) was measured utilizing a Mach-Zehnder
arrangement, as depicted in Fig. 2(b).[14] Between 20 and 15 000 cm⁻¹
the reflectivity was investigated by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy; a gold mirror served as reference. The spectra were
extended up to the ultraviolet by room-temperature ellipsometric data
(6000-35 000 cm⁻¹). In order to determine the properties of the film, we
measured the optical parameters of a bare (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O₃ substrate
over the entire frequency and temperature ranges.

In Fig. 1(a) the optical reflectivity is plotted in a wide frequency
range for selected temperatures. In particular in the far-infrared range
the phonons of the substrate become obvious. The small film thickness
and moderate conductivity prevent the use of a Kramers-Kronig procedure
for obtaining the conductivity and permittivity spectra of the
semiobilique film. For the further analysis we therefore employ a
two-layer model that consists of the (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O₃ substrate with
thickness of 1.023 mm and optical parameters determined beforehand,
covered by the thin film of Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂. Using Fresnel’s
equations[11] we can analyze the intrinsic optical properties of the
film. In the THz range (4-40 cm⁻¹) where data for the transmission and
phase shift are available, a corresponding analysis was performed that
allowed us to directly determine the values of dielectric permittivity
and conductivity, with the experimental uncertainties strongly dependent
on the values of ϵ(ω, T) and σ(ω, T).[14] The same model was used to
evaluate the optical response of the film at higher frequencies.
Eventually a self-consistent fit of the conductivity and permittivity
spectra at THz frequencies and the reflectivity spectra at higher
frequencies yields the overall behavior of the conductivity as presented
in Fig. 1(b).

The properties of the Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂ film in the normal state
are described by two Drude terms, a narrow σ_(N) and a broad one σ_(B),
corresponding to two types of charge carriers as suggested in Ref. [15].
In addition, two Lorentz terms account for the interband transitions
above 2000−3000 cm⁻¹. In the superconducting state, two additional Drude
terms are introduced: one with a tiny scattering rate to model the
δ-function (Cooper pair response) obvious in the permittivity spectrum
and another term to describe the quasiparticle contribution to the
below-gap conductivity. The optical response at energies around the
superconducting gap is mimicked with two Lorentzians since an
appropriate model-independent expression is missing in fit programs. The
resulting curves σ(ω, T) are plotted in Fig. 1(b) for selected
temperatures.

The most important finding of our investigation is the distinct opening
of the superconducting gap which is directly seen in the drop of σ(ω, T)
around 30 cm⁻¹ upon cooling below T_(c), clearly depicted in Fig. 1(b)
and in more detail in Fig. 2(a) where we also indicated the uncertainty
of our data; for T=5 K the conductivity has completely vanished at
ω/(2 πc) ≈ 30 cm⁻¹. From this figure the value of the superconducting
energy gap can be determined as 2Δ₀ = 3.7 meV ± 10

## III Analysis and Discussion

In the metallic state (T> 20 K) the optical conductivity of
Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂ has three major components: (i) the

yield the (a) conductivity and (b) permittivity spectra. The lines in
panel (a) are calculated from the BCS theory assuming a complete opening
of the gap at 30 cm⁻¹ over the entire Fermi surface. A sketch of the
Mach-Zehnder arrangement is included in panel (b); the reference arm

measured in a wide frequency range at various temperatures. The dots
between 4 and 40 cm⁻¹ are calculated from the transmission measurements.
The thin gray line indicates the fit of the 5 K spectrum by the
Drude-Lorentz analysis. (b) Optical conductivity of
Ba(Fe_(0.9)-Co_(0.1))₂As₂ obtained from the Drude-Lorentz analysis of
the reflection and transmission spectra. The dots are directly
calculated from transmission and phase measuring by the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. The dashed part of the 5 K curve between 10 and 50 cm⁻¹
indicates that a simple Lorentz shape does not mimic the superconducting
gap properly since σ(ω) basically vanishes abruptly at 30 cm⁻¹. Below 10
cm⁻¹ a strong quasiparticle absorption is observed which seem to
disappear only well below 5 K. The inset shows the dc resistivity ρ(T)
of our sample with T_(c)=20 K.

infrared peaks at 4400 and 20 800 cm⁻¹ indicate interband transitions.
(ii) The background σ_(B)= 1300(Ω cm⁻¹), which is best seen in the
conductivity minimum around 1000 cm⁻¹, is more or less temperature
independent; we model it with a Drude term, albeit its roll-off (the
scattering rate and hence the plasma frequency) cannot be accurately
determined.[17] (iii) Most important is the narrow Drude component
σ_(N)(ω); the corresponding static conductivity grows and the peak
becomes sharper as T decreases. Its spectral weight decreases by 15

For T<T_(c) the THz conductivity dramatically decreases below 100 cm⁻¹
due to the opening of the superconducting gap at 30 cm⁻¹, as seen in
Fig. 1(b). The directly measured conductivity is displayed in more
detail in Fig. 2(a) together with calculations of the BCS-based
Mattis-Bardeen model.[20, 11, 21] The best description is obtained for
2Δ₀ = 3.7 meV, corresponding to 2Δ₀/k_(B)T_(c)= 2.1; this value is
considerably lower than expected from mean-field theory, but similar to
what has been determined from reflection measurements of single
crystals.[15, 16] In this region the shape of σ(ω) agrees well with the
BCS prediction for a simple s-wave superconductor with no nodes in the
order parameter. While an incomplete or anisotropic d-wave gap with
nodes better fits the absorption below 10 cm⁻¹, it would cause a much
larger contribution to σ(ω, T) in the gap-region around 30 cm⁻¹ where
the uncertainty of our data is quite small. Previous optical
investigations[22, 23] on hole-doped 122 iron pnictides draw similar
conclusions. While our film of Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.12))As₂ is in the dirty
limit, the K-doped compounds look more like a clean-limit
superconductor, where the structure in σ(ω) is not directly the gap
feature but influenced by bosonic excitations.

Below 10 cm⁻¹ a very narrow peak builds up for T<T_(c) due to the
quasiparticle contribution to the conductivity; its intensity first
increases and then diminishes as the quasiparticle number vanishes when
T→ 0. It is not clear by now why this low-frequency absorption is much
stronger than expected from theory for an isotropic and complete gap. In
Fig. 3(a) the temperature dependence of σ(ω, T) is plotted for selected
frequencies. From room temperature down to T=30 K we find the THz
conductivity basically not dependent on frequency, as expected for a
normal metal; maybe small indications of fluctuations below 50 K can be
identified. In the superconducting state, the conductivity at very low
frequency [ω/(2πc)=4.6 cm⁻¹] increases strongly right below T_(c), it
passes through a maximum σ_(max) around 14 K = 0.7 T_(c), and then drops
rapidly. As the frequency increases, this peak vanishes and only a
simple drop of the conductivity is observed for T<T_(c). In a very
recent paper, Schachinger _et al._ discussed exactly this behavior and
compared it with different models and parameters.[24]

The BCS theory predicts a so-called coherence peak in the electrodynamic
absorption of superconductors;[12, 11] it is considered as a hallmark of
singlet superconductivity and most pronounced in the dirty limit and for
s-wave symmetry of the order parameter. In contrast to theory and
observations on conventional superconductors,[25, 26] in the present
case the quasiparticle peak is larger in amplitude and extends to lower
temperatures, as already seen in Fig. 2(a). An even larger peak has been
reported[27] from microwave experiments on K-doped BaFe₂As₂ and
extensively discussed in Ref. [24]. It is desired to conduct further
experiments on different compositions and films in order to obtain more
information on scattering mechanisms, the influence of multiple bands
and cross scattering between the bands.

According to the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule[11, 21] the missing
area

A = ∫[σ^((n))(ω) − σ^((s))(ω)]dω
(1)

between the conductivity in the normal and the superconducting state is
collected in the δ peak of the condensate at ω= 0. It is a measure of
the penetration depth and gives λ =$c/\sqrt{\mathrm{A}}$= (2500 ± 700)
A. Alternatively the contribution of the superconducting carriers is
probed by the permittivity ϵ^(′) which for low frequencies goes as
1 − ϵ^(′) ∝ (ω_(μ^(′))/ω)² in excellent agreement with the experimental
results plotted in Fig. 2(b). Its development with temperature is
displayed in the inset of Fig. 3(b). For T→ 0 we obtain λ = (3600 ± 500)
A in good agreement with the values we obtained for single crystals.[15,
16] The spectral weight (ω_(μ^(′))/2πc)²= (1.94 ± 0.1) × 10⁷ cm⁻² of the
superconducting condensate is in excellent agreement with the scaling
relation suggested for cuprates.[28, 29, 30] We note that taking into
account the below-gap contribution to the conductivity due to
quasiparticles allows us to obtain more realistic values of the
superconducting density compared to reflectivity experiments.

below T_(c).

## IV Conclusions

films in a wide frequency and temperature range elucidate the
electrodynamic properties in the superconducting state. The opening of
