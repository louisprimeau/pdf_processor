###### Abstract

We have measured the temperature dependence of the absolute value of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(T) in a Ca_{10}(Pt_{3}As_{8})[(Fe_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}As_{2}]_{5} (x=0.097) single crystal using a low-temperature magnetic force microscope (MFM). We obtain \lambda_{\pm 0}(0)\approx 1000 nm via extrapolating the data to T=0. This large \lambda and pronounced anisotropy in this system are responsible for large thermal fluctuations and the presence of a liquid vortex phase in this low-temperature superconductor with a critical temperature of 11 K, consistent with the interpretation of the electrical transport data. The superconducting parameters obtained from \lambda and coherence length \xi place this compound in the extreme type II regime. Meissner responses (via MFM) at different locations across the sample are similar to each other, indicating good homogeneity of the superconducting state on a submicron scale.

Iron-based superconductors offer an opportunity to explore superconductivity over a very wide range of superconducting properties, such as critical fields, superfluid densities, and their anisotropy.[1] Comparing iron-based superconductors with cuprates provides clues to the mechanism of high T_{c} superconductivity that determine fundamental superconducting parameters, such as the gap symmetry[2, 3] and the upper critical fields,[4] as well as complex vortex dynamics due to the thermal fluctuations.[5, 6, 7] Understanding the correlation between intrinsic properties and the pinning mechanism is thus intriguing from both basic and applied points of view. Recently, superconductivity has been reported in a family of highly anisotropic materials, Ca_{10}(Pt_{4}As_{8})[(Fe_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}As_{2}]_{5} (Ca-Pt-Fe-As) with n=3 ("10-3-8") and n=4 ("10-4-8").[8, 9, 10] The 10-3-8 phase has _triclinic_ symmetry and a T_{c} of up to 11 K upon Pt doping; the 10-4-8 phase has tetragonal symmetry with the highest T_{c} of 38 K. It is worth noting that well-defined Fermi surface sheets with tetragonal symmetry, similar to other pnictides, are observed in the 10-3-8 phase in spite of its triclinic symmetry.[11] Anisotropy of the critical field in the 10-3-8 phase near T_{c}, \nu_{H_{c2}}(T_{c})\equiv H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c}\approx 10 (Ref. [8]), is much larger than that of the 122 pnictide compounds, \nu_{H_{c2}}(T_{c})\approx 2 (Ref. [12]), consistent with a more anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) nature of the 10-3-8 system. In contrast to Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} superconductors, well studied by a variety of techniques,[13] 10-3-8 shows a broadened superconducting transition temperature with applied field,[8] consistent with strong thermal fluctuations of vortices.[5]

In this Rapid Communication we present measurements of the absolute value of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda in the 10-3-8 compound. We derive the values of several basic superconducting parameters from our measurements and relate them to other unusual properties observed in the 10-3-8 compound, such as a broadened superconducting phase transition. We have determined the temperature dependence of the absolute value of \lambda(T) in a 10-3-8 single crystal (x=0.097)[8] with T_{c}\approx 11 K using a Meissner technique employing magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Our experimental approach for \lambda measurements is simple, robust, and independent of the MFM tip model, whereas most previous MFM studies provided either \delta\lambda variations or the absolute value from modeling the tip magnetization instead of measuring \lambda directly.[14, 15] Recently, the temperature dependence of \delta\lambda was measured via a tunnel-diode resonator technique, and it showed an increasing anisotropy of the superconducting gap as doping decreases from optimal doping toward the edges of the superconducting dome.[16] Our MFM results show that the superconductivity is homogeneous, which agrees well with tunnel diode,[16] transport,[8] and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data.[17] By extrapolating our temperature-dependent data from 4 K to T=0, we obtain \lambda_{ab}(0)\approx 1000 nm. The short electron mean free path in this system, compared to the coherence length, suggests that this system is in the dirty limit, which is partly responsible for the large \lambda value. Strong thermal fluctuations inferred from the Ginzburg number are consistent with a wide superconducting transition under field and the presence of a vortex-liquid phase in this highly anisotropic superconductor with relatively lowT_{c}.[8]

Synthesis of the 10-3-8 system is described elsewhere.[8] All measurements described here were performed in a home-built low-temperature MFM apparatus,[17] which allows acquisition of a complete set of MFM data on several samples with identical MFM tip conditions. With this apparatus, a Meissner response curve[14] is measured first as a function of the tip-sample separation in the reference sample (Nb film), and then the cantilever is moved to the sample of interest (10-3-8) where its Meissner response as a function of tip-sample distance is obtained. Direct comparison of these curves yields the absolute value of \lambda_{ab} in 10-3-8 and its temperature dependence \lambda_{ab}(T). (We measure \lambda_{ab} since the shielding currents run in the basal plane.) The \lambda value of the reference Nb film was verified by both a different MFM technique and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)  magnetometry measurements, as described elsewhere.[15] The vortex imaging, after field cooling the sample in a field of a few Oersted to avoid the demagnetization effect of the sample, was performed in a frequency modulation mode with the tip-lift height of 400 nm above the sample surface. The zero point of the tip-sample separation was determined by touching the surface of the sample; this touchdown of the tip resulted in a substantial negative frequency shift. The tip-sample separation was measured based on the calibration of the piezo scanner. We used a high resolution cobalt-coated Nanosensors cantilever[18] that was polarized along the tip axis in a 30-kOe magnetic field (H). The Meissner experiment was performed under the conditions of no vortices being present in a 20 \mum \times 20 \mum field of view, which eliminates possible force contributions of vortices to the Meissner force. Before vortex measurements on the 10-3-8 sample, the stray field (H_{sl}) from a superconducting magnet was calibrated by measuring the number of vortices as a function of field on the Nb reference [see Fig. 1(b)]: the Nb reference serves as a magnetic field sensor. The red line in Fig. 1(b) is a linear fit to the experimental data with a fit function of N=(N/H)H+H_{sl}, where N is a number of vortices. The obtained slope and H_{sf} from the fit are 1.6 Oe^{-1} and -2.6 Oe, respectively. The calculated single vortex flux \Phi_{\rm expt}, from the slope of the fit and the area of a vortex image is \Phi_{\rm expt}={\rm area}\times(N/H)^{-1}= (6 \mum \times 6 \mum \times (1.6)^{-1} = 22.6 G \mum^{2}, which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of a single flux quantum \Phi_{0}=h/2e=20.7 G \mum^{2}. The Nb reference film is homogeneous with a uniform (though irregular) distribution of vortices. The stray field calibration in Fig. 1(b) was reproducible at three different locations of the Nb reference.

Figures 1(c)-1(f) show MFM images obtained at two different nominal fields of H=-3 Oe and H=-7 Oe in both the Nb reference [Figs. 1(c) and 1(d)] and the 10-3-8 single crystal [Figs. 1(e) and 1(f)]. We obtained MFM images at several locations across the sample's surface separated by hundreds of microns and observed no vortices. Thermal drift of the MFM system equals a few nanometers per hour at 4 K. The low drift comes from a rigid design of the MFM apparatus. More technical details can be found in Ref. [15]. This indicates that the lack of vortices in a 10-3-8 sample is an intrinsic property. The lack of vortices may be due to a large \lambda, leading to a very slow exponential decay of the vortex profile over a large length scale, and hence a smaller intensity of the MFM signal in the vortex center.[19] To verify this possibility, we measured the Meissner response as a function of the tip-sample separation. An MFM tip experiences a Meissner force because of the interaction between the tip magnetic moment and a field generated from the shielding current induced by the tip moment. The Meissner response force can be expressed as a function of \lambda and the tip-sample separation d, F_{\rm Meissner}=A\times f(d+\lambda), where A is a prefactor that reflects the sensor's geometry and the magnetic moment.[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 7

 in Fig. 2(c), was obtained from Meissner curves measured at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Figure 2(c) displays the absolute values of of \lambda(T) obtained using MFM (red solid diamonds) and using tunnel diode measurements [16] (blue open diamonds). To compare the two data sets, the tunnel diode data [\delta\lambda(T)] are shifted along the y axis by 1 \mum, the absolute value of \lambda(0) obtained from MFM measurements. These data sets demonstrate consistency, proving the validity of the MFM approach. We also measured the absolute value of \lambda in a 10-3-8 sample with a different doping level (x=0.042; T_{c}\approx 10 K) and obtained (a doping dependence) \lambda_{ab}(0)\approx 1200\pm 100 nm.

The large \lambda measured here can be due to either impurity scattering or an intrinsically small superfluid density. To evaluate the contribution from impurities, we first estimate the electronic mean free path using the Drude model l=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{g_{K\delta k_{F}}}{m_{0}}, where R_{K} is the von Kitzing constant (R_{K}=h/e^{2}\approx 25813\Omega), k_{F} is the Fermi wave vector, n is the charge carrier density, and \rho is the resistivity. We obtain l\approx1.5 nm, using n and \rho obtained via transport measurements [8] and k_{F}\approx 0.3\pi/a from ARPES [10]. The mean free path (l=1.5 nm) is shorter than the coherence length (\xi=5 nm) obtained from transport [8] (l<\xi), and indicates that the system is in the dirty limit, partially explaining the large \lambda value. In the dirty limit the effective penetration depth is \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=\lambda_{\rm clean}(0)[1+\xi_{0}(0)/l]^{1/2} using the local approximation and the effective coherence length is \xi_{\rm eff}=\xi_{\rm clean}(0)/[1+\xi_{0}(0)/l]^{1/2}[24; 25]. For \xi_{0}=19.7 nm (obtained from the equation of \xi_{\rm eff}), \lambda_{\rm eff}=1000 nm, and l=1.5 nm, \lambda_{\rm clean} in the clean limit is approximately 270 nm.

A large \lambda also can be due to a small superfluid density. The London penetration \lambda_{L}=\sqrt{\frac{m^{\star}}{\mu m\sigma^{2}}}, where m^{\star} is an effective electron mass, \mu_{0} is the vacuum permeability, n is the charge carrier density, and e is an electron charge. ARPES E(k) data allow us to calculate the effective mass of the charge carriers using the expression 1/m^{\star}=\frac{1}{\beta^{\prime}}(d^{2}E/dk^{2})_{E^{\prime}}. We obtain m^{\star}\approx 7.3m_{e}, where m_{e} is a bare electron mass [10]. This m^{\star} and n\approx 0.74\times 10^{27} m^{-3}, obtained from transport measurements [8], results in \lambda_{L}\approx 530 nm. This calculated \lambda_{L} corresponds to an intrinsic \lambda, because the experimental band dispersion and carrier density do not depend on disorder. Therefore, we can directly compare \lambda_{\rm clean}\approx 270 nm with \lambda_{L}\approx 530 nm from ARPES and transport. The discrepancy is likely a result of the carrier density being obtained using a single band approximation, whereas ARPES and theoretical electron band calculations show a multiband character of the Fermi surface.

The small superfluid density, reflected in the large measured penetration depth, indicates a weak phase stiffness of the superconducting order parameter and suggests that phase fluctuations may be important in 10-3-8. We add in Fig. 3 the values of \lambda for 10-3-8 as red solid stars to the Uemura plot [26], which shows the scaling between \lambda^{-2}(0)\propto n_{s}/m^{\star} and T_{c} in unconventional superconductors. We see that the phase stiffness relative to T_{c} is weaker than in other Fe-based superconductors as well as the cuprates, even weaker than that in highly underdoped yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) [27; 30; 31]. This

[28] and [29], respectively. The red solid squares show highly underdoped YBCO superconductors taken from Ref. [30]. The red solid stars represent the data for 10-3-8 obtained in this work.

The Meissner curves obtained from 10-3-8 were obtained at three lateral positions separated by approximately 10 \mum. Their similarity indicates good homogeneity of the superconducting state on a submicron scale in the sample. By shifting the red open curve by 900 nm, the resulting curve (open squares) overlaps the Nb reference curve. (b) Temperature-dependent Meissner response curves. Note that the Meissner curves decay more slowly with increasing tip-sample separation as the temperature increases, indicating an increase of \lambda with temperature. (c) Temperature-dependent \lambda measurements. Red solid diamonds are experimental data inferred from curves in (b). Blue open diamonds are taken from tunnel diode resonator measurements (Ref. [16]). We shifted tunnel diode data along the y axis by 1 \mum, the value obtained from MFM measurements, and overlaid on our data to directly compare with the MFM data. (d) Superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) calculated from (c). The black line corresponds to \rho_{s}^{20}=\hbar^{2}d/4k_{B}e^{2}\mu_{0}\lambda^{2}=(2/\pi)T in each FeAs plane.

  may reflect a "Swiss cheese"-like response of the system to impurities, indicating nanoscale inhomogeneity is likely present in 10-3-8.[23, 33] Our measurement of \lambda is not sensitive to heterogeneity on this scale. The relatively large anisotropy of the upper critical field further suggests that 10-3-8 may be the most quasi-2D material of all Fe-based superconductors,[8] thus bearing more resemblance to the cuprate superconductors. Figure 2(d) shows the measured superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) as well as prediction of the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinsky (KTB) theory of vortex unbinding that should be applicable to a highly anisotropic 2D superconductor.[34]\rho_{s}(T) passes smoothly through the KTB line, indicating that superconductivity of the 10-3-8 phase is still of a three-dimensional (3D) character.

We now discuss the effects of the large \lambda on other superconducting properties. The H_{c2} values obtained from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory[35] are H_{c2}^{\rm lab}=55 T and H_{c2}^{\rm lab}=13 T, and the corresponding \xi values are \xi_{\rm lab}(0)=5 nm and \xi_{\rm lab}(0)=1.2 nm.[8] We calculate \kappa=\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab}\approx 200, using \lambda_{ab}\approx 1000 nm and \xi_{ab}\approx 5 nm, the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}=\Phi_{0}/2\sqrt{2}\lambda_{1}(0)\approx 500 Oe, and the depairing current J_{d}=\Phi_{0}/3\sqrt{3}\pi\mu_{0}\lambda^{2}\xi\approx 2 MA cm^{2}. These values indicate that the 10-3-8 compound is an extreme type II superconductor. Anisotropy of the critical field in this compound \gamma\mu_{c_{2}}=H_{c2}^{\rm lab}/H_{c2}^{\rm lab} shows a strong temperature dependence, ranging from 10 near T_{c} to 5 at 0.97c.[8] The resistive signature of the superconducting transition broadens with increasing magnetic field, indicating the presence of strong magnetic fluctuations.[8] The fundamental parameter governing the strength of the thermal fluctuations is the Ginzburg number Gi, Gi = [T_{c^{\prime}}/H_{c}^{2}(0)\xi^{3}(0)]^{2}/2, where H_{c} is the thermodynamical critical field and \gamma is the anisotropy parameter.[5] Using T_{c}\approx 11 K, \gamma\approx 10, \xi=5 nm, and \lambda\approx 1000 nm, we obtain Gi \approx 0.16. The theoretical width of the transition, \Delta T_{c}\geqslant GiT_{c}, is approximately 1.8 K, consistent with the experimental value of \Delta T_{c}\approx 2 K, although, we cannot rule out that the rounding is also partially a result of nanoscale spatial inhomogeneity of T_{c}.[8] The Gi in the 10-3-8 compound is larger than that in YBCO (Gi = 0.01) and BiSCCO (Gi = 0.1).[5] The broadening of the superconducting transition with increasing magnetic field is consistent with the presence of a vortex-liquid phase, similar to cuprates.[5]

In conclusion, we measured the absolute value of \lambda in a single crystal of Ca_{10}(Pt_{3}As_{8})[(Fe_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}As_{2}]_{5} (x=0.097) using a Meissner technique in a low-temperature MFM apparatus. Similar Meissner responses in different regions of the sample indicate that the superconductivity is homogeneous on a scale of \lambda. We obtain the value of \lambda(0) in our sample of approximately 1000 nm. The clean limit penetration depth is calculated to be 270 nm based on an impurity scattering model. The large Ginzburg number (Gi \approx 0.16) agrees well with the previously reported data that show a broad superconducting transition and a signature of a vortex liquid phase in this highly anisotropic _low_T_{c} = 11 K superconductor.

###### Abstract

We have measured the temperature dependence of the absolute value of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(T) in a Ca_{10}(Pt_{3}As_{8})[(Fe_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}As_{2}]_{5} (x=0.097) single crystal using a low-temperature magnetic force microscope (MFM). We obtain \lambda_{\pm 0}(0)\approx 1000 nm via extrapolating the data to T=0. This large \lambda and pronounced anisotropy in this system are responsible for large thermal fluctuations and the presence of a liquid vortex phase in this low-temperature superconductor with a critical temperature of 11 K, consistent with the interpretation of the electrical transport data. The superconducting parameters obtained from \lambda and coherence length \xi place this compound in the extreme type II regime. Meissner responses (via MFM) at different locations across the sample are similar to each other, indicating good homogeneity of the superconducting state on a submicron scale.

Iron-based superconductors offer an opportunity to explore superconductivity over a very wide range of superconducting properties, such as critical fields, superfluid densities, and their anisotropy.[1] Comparing iron-based superconductors with cuprates provides clues to the mechanism of high T_{c} superconductivity that determine fundamental superconducting parameters, such as the gap symmetry[2, 3] and the upper critical fields,[4] as well as complex vortex dynamics due to the thermal fluctuations.[5, 6, 7] Understanding the correlation between intrinsic properties and the pinning mechanism is thus intriguing from both basic and applied points of view. Recently, superconductivity has been reported in a family of highly anisotropic materials, Ca_{10}(Pt_{4}As_{8})[(Fe_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}As_{2}]_{5} (Ca-Pt-Fe-As) with n=3 ("10-3-8") and n=4 ("10-4-8").[8, 9, 10] The 10-3-8 phase has _triclinic_ symmetry and a T_{c} of up to 11 K upon Pt doping; the 10-4-8 phase has tetragonal symmetry with the highest T_{c} of 38 K. It is worth noting that well-defined Fermi surface sheets with tetragonal symmetry, similar to other pnictides, are observed in the 10-3-8 phase in spite of its triclinic symmetry.[11] Anisotropy of the critical field in the 10-3-8 phase near T_{c}, \nu_{H_{c2}}(T_{c})\equiv H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c}\approx 10 (Ref. [8]), is much larger than that of the 122 pnictide compounds, \nu_{H_{c2}}(T_{c})\approx 2 (Ref. [12]), consistent with a more anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) nature of the 10-3-8 system. In contrast to Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} superconductors, well studied by a variety of techniques,[13] 10-3-8 shows a broadened superconducting transition temperature with applied field,[8] consistent with strong thermal fluctuations of vortices.[5]

In this Rapid Communication we present measurements of the absolute value of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda in the 10-3-8 compound. We derive the values of several basic superconducting parameters from our measurements and relate them to other unusual properties observed in the 10-3-8 compound, such as a broadened superconducting phase transition. We have determined the temperature dependence of the absolute value of \lambda(T) in a 10-3-8 single crystal (x=0.097)[8] with T_{c}\approx 11 K using a Meissner technique employing magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Our experimental approach for \lambda measurements is simple, robust, and independent of the MFM tip model, whereas most previous MFM studies provided either \delta\lambda variations or the absolute value from modeling the tip magnetization instead of measuring \lambda directly.[14, 15] Recently, the temperature dependence of \delta\lambda was measured via a tunnel-diode resonator technique, and it showed an increasing anisotropy of the superconducting gap as doping decreases from optimal doping toward the edges of the superconducting dome.[16] Our MFM results show that the superconductivity is homogeneous, which agrees well with tunnel diode,[16] transport,[8] and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data.[17] By extrapolating our temperature-dependent data from 4 K to T=0, we obtain \lambda_{ab}(0)\approx 1000 nm. The short electron mean free path in this system, compared to the coherence length, suggests that this system is in the dirty limit, which is partly responsible for the large \lambda value. Strong thermal fluctuations inferred from the Ginzburg number are consistent with a wide superconducting transition under field and the presence of a vortex-liquid phase in this highly anisotropic superconductor with relatively lowT_{c}.[8]

Synthesis of the 10-3-8 system is described elsewhere.[8] All measurements described here were performed in a home-built low-temperature MFM apparatus,[17] which allows acquisition of a complete set of MFM data on several samples with identical MFM tip conditions. With this apparatus, a Meissner response curve[14] is measured first as a function of the tip-sample separation in the reference sample (Nb film), and then the cantilever is moved to the sample of interest (10-3-8) where its Meissner response as a function of tip-sample distance is obtained. Direct comparison of these curves yields the absolute value of \lambda_{ab} in 10-3-8 and its temperature dependence \lambda_{ab}(T). (We measure \lambda_{ab} since the shielding currents run in the basal plane.) The \lambda value of the reference Nb film was verified by both a different MFM technique and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)  magnetometry measurements, as described elsewhere.[15] The vortex imaging, after field cooling the sample in a field of a few Oersted to avoid the demagnetization effect of the sample, was performed in a frequency modulation mode with the tip-lift height of 400 nm above the sample surface. The zero point of the tip-sample separation was determined by touching the surface of the sample; this touchdown of the tip resulted in a substantial negative frequency shift. The tip-sample separation was measured based on the calibration of the piezo scanner. We used a high resolution cobalt-coated Nanosensors cantilever[18] that was polarized along the tip axis in a 30-kOe magnetic field (H). The Meissner experiment was performed under the conditions of no vortices being present in a 20 \mum \times 20 \mum field of view, which eliminates possible force contributions of vortices to the Meissner force. Before vortex measurements on the 10-3-8 sample, the stray field (H_{sl}) from a superconducting magnet was calibrated by measuring the number of vortices as a function of field on the Nb reference [see Fig. 1(b)]: the Nb reference serves as a magnetic field sensor. The red line in Fig. 1(b) is a linear fit to the experimental data with a fit function of N=(N/H)H+H_{sl}, where N is a number of vortices. The obtained slope and H_{sf} from the fit are 1.6 Oe^{-1} and -2.6 Oe, respectively. The calculated single vortex flux \Phi_{\rm expt}, from the slope of the fit and the area of a vortex image is \Phi_{\rm expt}={\rm area}\times(N/H)^{-1}= (6 \mum \times 6 \mum \times (1.6)^{-1} = 22.6 G \mum^{2}, which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of a single flux quantum \Phi_{0}=h/2e=20.7 G \mum^{2}. The Nb reference film is homogeneous with a uniform (though irregular) distribution of vortices. The stray field calibration in Fig. 1(b) was reproducible at three different locations of the Nb reference.

Figures 1(c)-1(f) show MFM images obtained at two different nominal fields of H=-3 Oe and H=-7 Oe in both the Nb reference [Figs. 1(c) and 1(d)] and the 10-3-8 single crystal [Figs. 1(e) and 1(f)]. We obtained MFM images at several locations across the sample's surface separated by hundreds of microns and observed no vortices. Thermal drift of the MFM system equals a few nanometers per hour at 4 K. The low drift comes from a rigid design of the MFM apparatus. More technical details can be found in Ref. [15]. This indicates that the lack of vortices in a 10-3-8 sample is an intrinsic property. The lack of vortices may be due to a large \lambda, leading to a very slow exponential decay of the vortex profile over a large length scale, and hence a smaller intensity of the MFM signal in the vortex center.[19] To verify this possibility, we measured the Meissner response as a function of the tip-sample separation. An MFM tip experiences a Meissner force because of the interaction between the tip magnetic moment and a field generated from the shielding current induced by the tip moment. The Meissner response force can be expressed as a function of \lambda and the tip-sample separation d, F_{\rm Meissner}=A\times f(d+\lambda), where A is a prefactor that reflects the sensor's geometry and the magnetic moment.[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 7

 in Fig. 2(c), was obtained from Meissner curves measured at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Figure 2(c) displays the absolute values of of \lambda(T) obtained using MFM (red solid diamonds) and using tunnel diode measurements [16] (blue open diamonds). To compare the two data sets, the tunnel diode data [\delta\lambda(T)] are shifted along the y axis by 1 \mum, the absolute value of \lambda(0) obtained from MFM measurements. These data sets demonstrate consistency, proving the validity of the MFM approach. We also measured the absolute value of \lambda in a 10-3-8 sample with a different doping level (x=0.042; T_{c}\approx 10 K) and obtained (a doping dependence) \lambda_{ab}(0)\approx 1200\pm 100 nm.

The large \lambda measured here can be due to either impurity scattering or an intrinsically small superfluid density. To evaluate the contribution from impurities, we first estimate the electronic mean free path using the Drude model l=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{g_{K\delta k_{F}}}{m_{0}}, where R_{K} is the von Kitzing constant (R_{K}=h/e^{2}\approx 25813\Omega), k_{F} is the Fermi wave vector, n is the charge carrier density, and \rho is the resistivity. We obtain l\approx1.5 nm, using n and \rho obtained via transport measurements [8] and k_{F}\approx 0.3\pi/a from ARPES [10]. The mean free path (l=1.5 nm) is shorter than the coherence length (\xi=5 nm) obtained from transport [8] (l<\xi), and indicates that the system is in the dirty limit, partially explaining the large \lambda value. In the dirty limit the effective penetration depth is \lambda_{\rm eff}(0)=\lambda_{\rm clean}(0)[1+\xi_{0}(0)/l]^{1/2} using the local approximation and the effective coherence length is \xi_{\rm eff}=\xi_{\rm clean}(0)/[1+\xi_{0}(0)/l]^{1/2}[24; 25]. For \xi_{0}=19.7 nm (obtained from the equation of \xi_{\rm eff}), \lambda_{\rm eff}=1000 nm, and l=1.5 nm, \lambda_{\rm clean} in the clean limit is approximately 270 nm.

A large \lambda also can be due to a small superfluid density. The London penetration \lambda_{L}=\sqrt{\frac{m^{\star}}{\mu m\sigma^{2}}}, where m^{\star} is an effective electron mass, \mu_{0} is the vacuum permeability, n is the charge carrier density, and e is an electron charge. ARPES E(k) data allow us to calculate the effective mass of the charge carriers using the expression 1/m^{\star}=\frac{1}{\beta^{\prime}}(d^{2}E/dk^{2})_{E^{\prime}}. We obtain m^{\star}\approx 7.3m_{e}, where m_{e} is a bare electron mass [10]. This m^{\star} and n\approx 0.74\times 10^{27} m^{-3}, obtained from transport measurements [8], results in \lambda_{L}\approx 530 nm. This calculated \lambda_{L} corresponds to an intrinsic \lambda, because the experimental band dispersion and carrier density do not depend on disorder. Therefore, we can directly compare \lambda_{\rm clean}\approx 270 nm with \lambda_{L}\approx 530 nm from ARPES and transport. The discrepancy is likely a result of the carrier density being obtained using a single band approximation, whereas ARPES and theoretical electron band calculations show a multiband character of the Fermi surface.

The small superfluid density, reflected in the large measured penetration depth, indicates a weak phase stiffness of the superconducting order parameter and suggests that phase fluctuations may be important in 10-3-8. We add in Fig. 3 the values of \lambda for 10-3-8 as red solid stars to the Uemura plot [26], which shows the scaling between \lambda^{-2}(0)\propto n_{s}/m^{\star} and T_{c} in unconventional superconductors. We see that the phase stiffness relative to T_{c} is weaker than in other Fe-based superconductors as well as the cuprates, even weaker than that in highly underdoped yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) [27; 30; 31]. This

Figure 2: (Color online) (a) Meissner curves obtained from a Nb reference and a 10-3-8 sample with the same experimental conditions during a single cooldown. The Meissner curves obtained from 10-3-8 were obtained at three lateral positions separated by approximately 10 \mum. Their similarity indicates good homogeneity of the superconducting state on a submicron scale in the sample. By shifting the red open curve by 900 nm, the resulting curve (open squares) overlaps the Nb reference curve. (b) Temperature-dependent Meissner response curves. Note that the Meissner curves decay more slowly with increasing tip-sample separation as the temperature increases, indicating an increase of \lambda with temperature. (c) Temperature-dependent \lambda measurements. Red solid diamonds are experimental data inferred from curves in (b). Blue open diamonds are taken from tunnel diode resonator measurements (Ref. [16]). We shifted tunnel diode data along the y axis by 1 \mum, the value obtained from MFM measurements, and overlaid on our data to directly compare with the MFM data. (d) Superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) calculated from (c). The black line corresponds to \rho_{s}^{20}=\hbar^{2}d/4k_{B}e^{2}\mu_{0}\lambda^{2}=(2/\pi)T in each FeAs plane.

  may reflect a "Swiss cheese"-like response of the system to impurities, indicating nanoscale inhomogeneity is likely present in 10-3-8.[23, 33] Our measurement of \lambda is not sensitive to heterogeneity on this scale. The relatively large anisotropy of the upper critical field further suggests that 10-3-8 may be the most quasi-2D material of all Fe-based superconductors,[8] thus bearing more resemblance to the cuprate superconductors. Figure 2(d) shows the measured superfluid density \rho_{s}(T) as well as prediction of the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinsky (KTB) theory of vortex unbinding that should be applicable to a highly anisotropic 2D superconductor.[34]\rho_{s}(T) passes smoothly through the KTB line, indicating that superconductivity of the 10-3-8 phase is still of a three-dimensional (3D) character.

We now discuss the effects of the large \lambda on other superconducting properties. The H_{c2} values obtained from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory[35] are H_{c2}^{\rm lab}=55 T and H_{c2}^{\rm lab}=13 T, and the corresponding \xi values are \xi_{\rm lab}(0)=5 nm and \xi_{\rm lab}(0)=1.2 nm.[8] We calculate \kappa=\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab}\approx 200, using \lambda_{ab}\approx 1000 nm and \xi_{ab}\approx 5 nm, the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}=\Phi_{0}/2\sqrt{2}\lambda_{1}(0)\approx 500 Oe, and the depairing current J_{d}=\Phi_{0}/3\sqrt{3}\pi\mu_{0}\lambda^{2}\xi\approx 2 MA cm^{2}. These values indicate that the 10-3-8 compound is an extreme type II superconductor. Anisotropy of the critical field in this compound \gamma\mu_{c_{2}}=H_{c2}^{\rm lab}/H_{c2}^{\rm lab} shows a strong temperature dependence, ranging from 10 near T_{c} to 5 at 0.97c.[8] The resistive signature of the superconducting transition broadens with increasing magnetic field, indicating the presence of strong magnetic fluctuations.[8] The fundamental parameter governing the strength of the thermal fluctuations is the Ginzburg number Gi, Gi = [T_{c^{\prime}}/H_{c}^{2}(0)\xi^{3}(0)]^{2}/2, where H_{c} is the thermodynamical critical field and \gamma is the anisotropy parameter.[5] Using T_{c}\approx 11 K, \gamma\approx 10, \xi=5 nm, and \lambda\approx 1000 nm, we obtain Gi \approx 0.16. The theoretical width of the transition, \Delta T_{c}\geqslant GiT_{c}, is approximately 1.8 K, consistent with the experimental value of \Delta T_{c}\approx 2 K, although, we cannot rule out that the rounding is also partially a result of nanoscale spatial inhomogeneity of T_{c}.[8] The Gi in the 10-3-8 compound is larger than that in YBCO (Gi = 0.01) and BiSCCO (Gi = 0.1).[5] The broadening of the superconducting transition with increasing magnetic field is consistent with the presence of a vortex-liquid phase, similar to cuprates.[5]

In conclusion, we measured the absolute value of \lambda in a single crystal of Ca_{10}(Pt_{3}As_{8})[(Fe_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}As_{2}]_{5} (x=0.097) using a Meissner technique in a low-temperature MFM apparatus. Similar Meissner responses in different regions of the sample indicate that the superconductivity is homogeneous on a scale of \lambda. We obtain the value of \lambda(0) in our sample of approximately 1000 nm. The clean limit penetration depth is calculated to be 270 nm based on an impurity scattering model. The large Ginzburg number (Gi \approx 0.16) agrees well with the previously reported data that show a broad superconducting transition and a signature of a vortex liquid phase in this highly anisotropic _low_T_{c} = 11 K superconductor.
