This means that \(\Gamma_{s}(T \leq T_{c}) \approx 0\), and line broadening sets in just below \(T_{c}\) where the superconducting gap opens. For anisotropic gap functions the situation is more complicated, since certain relaxation channels exist even at the lowest temperature.[12]

For the present experiments four samples of the optimally doped high-\(T_{c}\) compound La1,81H00.04Sr0.15CuO4 were prepared for the isotopes 16O and 18O as well as 63Cu and 65Cu. The Ho3+ content has to be kept below ~5% in order to ensure the sample homogeneity and single-phase character.[13] The samples were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction using stoichiometric amounts of dried La2O3 (99.9%), Ho2O3 (99.9%), SrCO3 (99.9%), and CuO (99%). The powders were mixed, ground thoroughly, pressed into pellets, and fired in air at 850 degC (30 h), 900 degC (40 h), and 950 degC (50 h) with intermediate grindings. After the neutron scattering experiments, the La1,81H00.04Sr0.15Cu16O4 sample was subject to 18O diffusion in order to obtain La1,81H00.04Sr0.15Cu18O4. The process was peformed in a closed system at 850 degC during 100 h as described in Ref. 14. The 18O concentration was determined by mass spectrometry during the exchange process to be (81 +- 1) %. The copper-isotope-substituted samples were prepared from very-high-purity 63Cu and 65Cu metals. For this purpose, 63CuO and 65CuO powders were obtained by oxygenation of the metals at 900 degC during 20 h with one intermediate grinding. From there on, the solid-state reaction took place as described above. All samples were confirmed by high-resolution neutron-powder diffraction to be single phase (impurity phases less than ~1%). The structural parameters and oxygen contents of all samples were found to be the same within experimental uncertainties. The critical temperatures were determined by dc magnetometry to be \(T_{c} \approx 32\) K, and the observed isotope shifts turned out to be \(\Delta T_{c}({\rm O})\) = - (0.43 +- 0.05) K and \(\Delta T_{c}({\rm Cu}) = - (0.37 +- 0.04)\) K, which can be described by the isotope coefficients \(\alpha_{O}\) = 0.11 +- 0.01 and \(\alpha_{Cu} = 0.29 +- 0.04\), in agreement with literature data.[15, 16]

The inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed on the high-resolution time-of-flight spectrometers FOCUS and IN5, installed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen) and at the Institute Laue-Langevin (Grenoble), respectively. FOCUS and IN5 were operated with incoming neutron wavelengths of 5.75 and 6 A, giving energy resolutions at the elastic position [full width at half maximum (FWHM)] of 46 and 55 \(\mu\)eV, respectively. The samples were enclosed under He atmosphere in Al cylinders and placed into a cryostat in order to reach temperatures in the range 10 \(\leq T\) \(\leq\) 100 K. The raw data were corrected for absorption, detector efficiency, background, and detailed balance effects according to standard procedures.

Figure 1 shows energy spectra of neutrons scattered from La1,81H00.04Sr0.15Cu16O4. There are strong ground-state crystal-field transitions at \(\hbar\omega \approx 0.18\) meV, i.e., \(\left| \hbar\omega \right|\)\(\approx 2\Delta_{max}\)[~16 meV (Ref. 17)]. Further transitions are expected to appear above 10 meV and to be at least one order of magnitude less intense,[18] which means that the observed low-energy crystal-field spectrum will not be contaminated by excited-state transitions for temperatures up to 100 K. At \(T = 10\) K the width of the crystal-field transitions is considerably broader than the instrumental energy resolution, typically of the order of 140 \(\mu\)eV, which is due to local structural distortions around the Ho3+ ions resulting from doping with Sr2+ ions. With increasing temperature the crystal-field transitions renormalize due to relaxation effects; i.e., the linewidths increase and the energies decrease. The lines in Fig. 1 show the result of a least-squares fitting procedure in which the crystal-field transitions were described by a con

  volution of a temperature-independent Gaussian function (corresponding to the residual low-temperature width of 140 \(\mu\)eV as explained above) with a temperature-dependent Lorentzian function describing the intrinsic linewidth \(\Gamma(T)\) due to the interaction with the charge carriers. The fitting parameters were therefore the intrinsic linewidth \(\Gamma(T)\), the energy of the crystal-field transition, and an overall scale factor for the intensities. Similar energy spectra were obtained for the isotope-substituted \({}^{18}\)O, \({}^{63}\)Cu, and \({}^{65}\)Cu compounds which all gave evidence for a ground-state crystal-field transition at the same energy (\(\pm\) 0.18 meV at low temperature) as for the \({}^{16}\)O compound within the experimental uncertainties.

Figure 2 (upper panel) shows the temperature dependence of the intrinsic linewidth \(\Gamma(T)\) determined for the \({}^{16}\)O compound. The linewidth (FWHM) is rather small below 30 K; then it increases monotonically up to 60 K. Above 60 K the linewidth increases linearly as expected for the normal state; i.e., we set \(T^{\ast}(^{16}\)O) \(\approx\) 60 K. The solid line denotes the linewidth in the normal state which--considering only the first-excited crystal-field state--is given by the modified Korringa law [11]

\[\Gamma(T)=2\,\pi J_{ex}^{2}N^{2}(E_{F})\hbar\,\omega M^{2}\mbox{coth}\Biggl{(} \frac{\hbar\,\omega}{2k_{B}T}\Biggr{)},\] (2)

where \(J_{ex}\) is the exchange integral between the 4\(f\) electrons of the Ho\({}^{3+}\) ions and the charge carriers, \(N(E_{F})\) is the density of states at the Fermi level, and \(M\) is the transition matrix element of the crystal-field transition with energy \(\hbar\,\omega\)\(=\pm\) 0.18 meV. We took \(M^{2}\) = 37.6 as resulting from the extrapolation procedure described above. [18] From the high-temperature linewidth data (\(T\) \(>\) 60 K) we obtain \(J_{ex}N(E_{F})\) = 0.0057(2).

The temperature evolution of the intrinsic linewidth determined for the \({}^{18}\)O compound is shown in Fig. 2 (lower panel) which has a similar shape as for the \({}^{16}\)O compound. However, the crossover into normal-state behavior clearly occurs at a higher temperature; i.e., we set \(T^{\ast}(^{18}\)O) \(\approx\) 70 K. The slope in the normal state (\(T\) \(>\) 70 K) is governed by \(J_{ex}N(E_{F})\) = 0.0058(2). Our data give evidence for a large oxygen isotope shift of the pseudogap temperature \(T^{\ast}\) at optimal doping, namely \(\Delta T^{\ast}(O)\) \(\approx\) 10 K, which gives rise to an isotope coefficient \(\alpha\)*(\(O\)) \(\approx\) \(-\) 1.3.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the intrinsic linewidth determined for the \({}^{63}\)Cu (upper panel) and \({}^{65}\)Cu (lower panel) compounds. The relaxation behavior is similar to the \({}^{16}\)O compound, and there is practically no difference between the \({}^{63}\)Cu and \({}^{63}\)Cu data; i.e., we have \(T^{\ast}(^{63}\)Cu) \(\approx\) \(T^{\ast}(^{65}\)Cu) \(\approx\) 60 K. This means that there is no copper isotope effect on \(T^{\ast}\), i.e., \(\Delta T^{\ast}(Cu)\) \(\approx\) 0 K. From the slope in the normal state (\(T\) \(>\) 60 K) we obtain \(J_{ex}N(E_{F})\)

The lines denote the linewidth in the normal state calculated from Eq. (2).

The lines denote the linewidth in the normal state calculated from Eq. (2).

  =0.0057(2) and \(J_{ex}N(E_{F})\) = 0.0056(2) for the \({}^{63}\)Cu and \({}^{63}\)Cu compounds, respectively.

For all isotope-substituted samples the slope parameters \(J_{ex}N(E_{F})\) of the relaxation data in the normal state turned out to be the same within experimental uncertainties; i.e., there is no ambiguity concerning the "Korringa line" in Figs. 2 and 3. This also proves that all the samples--although separately synthesized--were actually equivalent concerning the doping level, which is important for the reliability of the reported isotope shifts for both \(T_{c}\) and \(T^{*}\).

The oxygen isotope substitution (\({}^{16}\)O vs \({}^{18}\)O) affects \(T_{c}\) and \(T^{*}\) in a different manner. A small negative shift is found in the former, whereas a large positive shift is found in the latter. This is in agreement with earlier results obtained for HoBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\), [2] in which the large value of \(\Delta T^{*}({\rm O})\) = 50 K was interpreted in terms of a polaron-like mechanism [22] associated with the oxygen Jahn-Teller modes. [6] Since a strong Jahn-Teller effect is also present in La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), the same mechanism is likely to apply here.

The copper isotope substitution (\({}^{63}\)Cu vs \({}^{65}\)Cu) results in a small negative shift for \(T_{c}\) and in the absence of a shift for \(T^{*}\). This is in contrast to the case of HoBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\), [3] for which a large value of \(\Delta T^{*}({\rm Cu})\) \(\approx\) 25 K was reported. This large copper isotope shift was associated with a local copper mode, although the experiment did not provide direct information about the specific type of lattice mode involved. By comparing \(\Delta T^{*}({\rm Cu})\) for both HoBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\) and La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), it is now possible to assign the copper mode to the umbrella-type mode, [8] which is present in the former compound but not in the latter. It favors an intersite bipolaron component in the bilayer compounds [23] which have \(T_{c}\)'s twice as large as the single-layer compounds.

In conclusion, the present neutron spectroscopic results of the oxygen and copper isotope effects on the pseudogap temperature \(T^{*}\) in the single-layer compound La\({}_{1.81}\)Ho\({}_{0.04}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)CuO\({}_{4}\)--together with earlier results obtained for the bilayer compound HoBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{8}\) (Refs. 2 and 3)--give evidence for the prominent role of local oxygen and copper lattice modes which have to be considered in the interaction Hamiltonian describing the superconducting state of high-\(T_{c}\) compounds. Whereas both Jahn-Teller-type oxygen modes and umbrella-type copper modes are relevant for the bilayer compounds, the latter are absent for the single-layer compounds.

We derived the crystal-field parameters by extrapolation from those of HoBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (Ref. 19) based on the procedure described in Refs. 9 and 10 and using the structural parameters for HoBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (Ref. 20) and La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (Ref. 21). This extrapolation procedure predicts the first excited crystal-field level to lie at 0.25 meV, separated from the next excited levels by about 10 meV. The transition matrix elements of the latter are at least an order of magnitude smaller than for the lowest crystal-field transition observed in the present work.
