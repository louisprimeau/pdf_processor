###### Abstract

By using neutron scattering techniques, we have studied the
incommensurate spin ordering as well as the low energy spin dynamics in
single crystal underdoped La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ with x∼ 0.095 and 0.08,
which are high temperature superconductors with T_(C)∼27 and 29 K,
respectively. Static two dimensional incommensurate magnetic order
appears below T_(N)=39.5 ± 0.3 K in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.095) and a
similar temperature for x=0.08 within the low temperature tetragonal
phase. The spin order is unaffected by either the onset of
superconductivity or the application of magnetic fields of up to 7 T
applied along the c axis in the x =0.095 sample. Such a magnetic field
_independent_ behavior is in marked contrast to the field induced
enhancement of the staggered magnetization observed in the related
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ system, which indicates that this phenomenon is not
a universal property of cuprate superconductors. Surprisingly, we find
that the incommensurability δ is only weakly dependent on doping
relative to La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄. Dispersive excitations in
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x =0.095) at the same incommensurate wave vector
persist up to at least 60 K. The dynamical spin susceptibility of the
low energy spin excitations saturates below T_(C) in a similar manner to
that seen in the superconducting state of La₂CuO_(4 + y).

## I Introduction

The roles of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom have been
central to the rich behavior brought to light over the last 20 years in
superconducting lamellar copper oxides.[1, 2, 3] In particular, cuprates
exhibit phenomena that are a sensitive function of doping, which evolves
from an antiferromagnetic insulating parent compound into a
superconducting phase with increasing hole density. A heterogeneous
electronic phase composed of stripes of itinerant charges now appears to
be a generic feature of hole doped ternary transition metal oxides[4]
such as manganites[5, 6] and nickelates,[7, 8, 9, 10] as well as
cuprates. The explanation for these incommensurate spin ordered states
is the subject of an ongoing debate. In an itinerant picture, the spin
dynamics are described in terms of electron-hole pair excitations about
an underlying Fermi surface.[11, 12, 13] Alternatively, within the
stripe picture of doped two dimensional Mott insulators, the nonmagnetic
holes in these materials organize into quasi-one-dimensional stripes
that separate antiferromagnetic insulating antiphase domains.[14] The
adjacent antiferromagnetic regions are π out of phase with each other,
which give rise to a magnetic structure with an incommensurate
periodicity, wherein the supercell dimension is twice the hole stripe
periodicity.

The static spin structures in the undoped parent compounds such as
La₂CuO₄ (Ref. [15]) or YBa₂Cu₃O₆ (Ref. [16]) have been determined by
neutron scattering to be relatively simple two sublattice
antiferromagnets characterized by a commensurate ordering wave vector of
(0.5,0.5) in reciprocal lattice units within the tetragonal basal plane.
On hole doping with either Sr substituting for La in
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ (Ref. [17]) or by adding additional oxygen in
YBa₂Cu₃O_(6 + x),[18, 19, 20] the magnetic scattering moves out to
incommensurate wave vectors, which is consistent with the stripe
ordering picture described above. This incommensurate magnetism can be
either static or dynamic as evidenced by either elastic or inelastic
peaks in the neutron scattering, respectively, and now appears to be a
common feature of the La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ family of compounds.
Specifically, for the lightly doped La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄, elastic
incommensurate magnetic Bragg features first appear split off from the
(0.5,0.5) position in diagonal directions relative to a tetragonal unit
cell.[21, 22] At a higher doping in the underdoped superconducting
regime, the peaks rotate by 45^(∘) to lie along directions parallel to
the tetragonal axes or Cu-O-Cu bonds, such that elastic magnetic
scattering appears at (0.5 ± δ, 0.5, 0) and (0.5, 0.5 ± δ, 0).[23, 24]
For optimal and higher doping, the static order disappears, but dynamic
incommensurate correlations, nevertheless, persist.[24, 25]

Within the stripe picture, one expects charge ordering associated with
the holes to occur at an incommensurate wave vector 2δ, which is twice
that describing the spin order. Neutron scattering is not directly
sensitive to charge ordering _per se_ but is sensitive to atomic
displacements such as those associated with oxygen, which arise from
charge ordering. An incommensurate nuclear scattering signature is,
therefore, expected to appear at (2 ± 2δ, 0, 0) or (2, ±2δ, 0) and
related wave vectors. Despite extensive efforts, such incommensurate
charge related scattering has not been observed in La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄
by either neutron or x-ray scattering techniques, although there is
indirect evidence of charge stripe excitations from optical
measurements.[26] Such scattering _has_ been observed in
La_(1.6 − x)Nd_(0.4)Sr_(x)CuO₄,[27, 28] as well as in
La_(1.875)Ba_(0.125 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ (x=0, 0.05, 0.06, 0.075, 0.085),[29]
which motivates discussion as to whether such static charge stripes
compete with, rather than underlie, high temperature superconductivity.

Surprisingly, La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄, which is the first high temperature
superconductor (HTSC) to be discovered,[30] has been much less
extensively studied than either La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO or YBa₂Cu₃O_(6 + x)
due to the difficulty of growing single crystals, which has only been
recently achieved.[31] In this paper, we report neutron scattering
signatures of static incommensurate spin order in single crystal
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x =0.095, 0.08), which is consistent with the
stripe picture described above, but with an interesting complexity not
accounted for within present theoretical models. Our results clearly
indicate that the spin ordering is insensitive to both the onset of
superconductivity and, surprisingly, the application of a magnetic
field. Tranquada _et al.[32]_ and Fujita _et al.[33]_ reported neutron
scattering measurements on an x=0.125 sample of La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄. In
both La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ and La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄, this concentration
corresponds to a suppression of T_(C) as a function of doping, known as
the "1/8" anomaly. In La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄, the suppression is almost
complete[34] and is associated with a structural phase transition at low
temperature, which is from orthorhombic to tetragonal,[38] which gives
rise to a superlattice peak at (0,1,0) and symmetry related reflections.
Samples of La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ near x=0.125 display a sequence of
structures on lowering the temperature, which is progressively going
from high temperature tetragonal (HTT, I4/mmm symmetry) to orthorhombic
(MTO, Bmab symmetry) to low temperature tetragonal (LTT, P4₂/ncm
symmetry).[38] The high temperature tetragonal to orthorhombic
transition in particular, and to a lesser extent, the orthorhombic to
low temperature tetragonal transition, are sensitive indicators for the
precise Ba doping level in the material.

## II Single crystal growth, characterization and experimental procedure

We have grown high quality single crystals of La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ with
x=0.095 and x=0.08 by using floating zone image furnace techniques with
a four-mirror optical furnace.[35] A small single crystal of La₂CuO₄ was
employed as a seed for the growth, which was performed under enclosed
pressures of 165 and 182 kPa of O₂ gas for the x =0.095 and x=0.08
samples, respectively. The resulting ∼ 6 g single crystals of
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ were cylindrical in shape and cut into dimensions
of 25 mm in length by 5 mm in diameter (x=0.095) and 38 mm in length by
5 mm diameter (x=0.08). We have determined the Ba concentration from the
HTT to MTO transition temperature. The La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.095)
and (x=0.08) single crystals displayed HTT to MTO structural phase
transitions at T_(d1)∼ 272 K and T_(d1)∼ 305 K, respectively, and MTO to
LTT transitions at T_(d2)∼ 45 K and T_(d2)∼ 35 K, respectively.[35] The
bulk superconducting transition temperatures T_(C)=27 K (x =0.095) and
T_(C)=29 K (x=0.08) are identified by using the onset of the zero field
cooled diamagnetic response of the crystals, which was measured by using
superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry and is shown in
Fig. 1. The various structural and superconducting phase transition
temperatures are summarized in Table 1 along with the corresponding
values for the La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.125) sample.[33]

The oxygen stoichiometry in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO_(4 + y) is more
difficult to quantify especially at the low levels relevant here.
Experience with La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO_(4 + y) suggests that the oxygen
stoichiometry y is negative in as-grown samples, which gives rise to
crystals that possess an effective doping level that is lower than that
given by the Sr concentration alone; the effective doping level is
x+2y.[36] Stoichiometric samples at optimal and underdoped Sr
concentrations display a maximum superconducting T_(C) which cannot be
increased by controlled annealing in O₂ gas. Excess oxygen can be
incorporated into LaCuO_(4 + y) crystals but only through
electrochemical doping methods, in which case y can be as high as 0.11
and the interstitial oxygen organizes itself into staged structures.[37]

Neutron scattering experiments were undertaken on the C5 and N5 triple
axis spectrometers at the Canadian Neutron Beam Centre at Chalk River.
All experiments were performed with pyrolytic graphite (002) planes as
monochromator and analyzer with constant E_(f)=14.7 meV. A graphite
filter was placed in the scattered beam to reduce contamination from
higher order neutrons. The single crystals were oriented with (H, K, 0)
in the horizontal scattering plane. Crystallographic indices are denoted
by using tetragonal notation, wherein the basal plane lattice constant
a=3.78 A at low temperatures.

La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.095 and 0.08) single crystals measured at
0.001 T. The dashed lines indicate the onset of superconductivity at
T_(C)=27 and 29 K for x=0.095 and x=0.08 samples, respectively.

## III Elastic neutron scattering in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.095)

### A. Meissner state

First, we discuss the more extensive measurements on the
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ sample with x=0.095. Elastic scattering scans at
T=3.8 K are shown in Fig. 2(a), in which Bragg peaks occur at
(0.5 ± δ, 0.5, 0)δ=0.112(3), which indicate static incommensurate spin
order. Analogous magnetic Bragg peaks are observed at
(0.5, 0.5 ± 0.112, 0). All peak widths are resolution limited with a
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.011 A-1, which indicate static
spin correlations within the basal plane exceeding 180 A. By contrast,
the spin correlations between planes are very short. To observe this,
the crystal was reoriented in the (H, H, L) scattering plane and then
tilted ∼7deg at constant L to intersect the incommensurate peak position
for H=0.39. Measurements along H of the form [H, H/(1-2δ), L] at fixed L
for L=2.5 and 3 are shown in Fig. 2(c) at T=3.5 K and at L=3 for T =50 K
to extract a background. Since the peak intensity is independent of L,
the scattering taking the form of an elastic rod along the L direction,
the static spin order at low temperatures is two dimensional. Note that
the intensity in Fig. 2(a) is greater relative to that in Fig. 2(c) for
the sample oriented in the (H, K, 0) plane. This arises because the
neutron spectrometer has a broad vertical resolution, which integrates
the signal in the L direction that is perpendicular to the scattering
plane.

The temperature dependence of the incommensurate magnetic elastic
scattering is illustrated in Fig. 3(a). The intensity of the magnetic
Bragg peak is proportional to the volume average of the square of the
ordered staggered moment. The spin order at (0.612, 0.5, 0) continuously
develops with temperature below T_(N)=39.5 ± 0.3 K. The temperature
dependence of the (0,1,0) structural Bragg peak indicates that the
orthorhombic to low temperature tetragonal phase transition occurs at
T_(d2)∼45 K, which is a transition that is discontinuous in nature.[38]
For reference, the superconducting transition at T_(C)∼ 27 K (see
Fig. 1) is also indicated on this plot as a dashed line. The onset of
spin ordering T_(N) most strongly correlates with the completion of the
transition to the low temperature tetragonal phase and the
incommensurate spin order coexists with the superconductivity below
T_(C). Associated incommensurate charge ordering has not been observed.
The temperature dependence of the spin ordering is qualitatively similar
to that observed in the x=1/8 compound,[33] wherein the superlattice
peak intensity becomes nonzero below ∼50 K. Similarly, no anomaly has
been observed at T_(C) in YBCO_(6.35) in the spin order, which has been
attributed to robust spin correlations.[19]

### B. Magnetic field dependence

The most surprising result of this study is that the incommensurate spin
structure shows no magnetic field dependence up to 7 T, applied
vertically along the c^(*) axis. Neither cooling nor warming the sample
in a magnetic field has an effect on either the temperature dependence
of the spin ordering, or the Bragg intensity in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄
(x=0.095), as shown in Fig. 3(c). This result is in marked contrast to
the behavior of underdoped and optimally doped La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄
wherein pronounced field dependent effects are observed. For the
optimally doped La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ compound (x =0.163), the
application of a magnetic field enhances the dynamical spin
susceptibility but does not induce static order.[39] Most dramatically,
in a slightly underdoped sample (x=0.144), Khaykovich _et al.[40]_
reported the development of a static incommensurate spin structure above
a critical field of 2.7 T. The authors, therefore, argued that
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.144) may be tuned through a quantum critical
point, at

which there is a magnetic field induced transition between magnetically
disordered and ordered phases. Their results are interpreted in terms of
a Ginzburg-Landau model by Demler _et al._, [41] which assumes a
microscopic competition between spin and superconducting order
parameters. The predicted magnetic intensity increases as
ΔI∼H/H_(c2)ln (H_(c2)/H), [41] which is consistent with experiments on
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄. Note that the intensity most rapidly changes with
magnetic field at low fields on a scale set by H_(c2). In the
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ family of compounds, the lower critical field is
H_(c1)∼0.04 T, while the upper critical field H_(c2) is in excess of 40
T. [42] The upper critical field is of the same order of magnitude in
optimally doped La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄. [43] Thus, an applied magnetic
field of 7 T should be sufficiently large to see an effect in
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄.

For sufficiently underdoped La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ (x =0.12,0.10), the
ordered magnetic moment associated with preexisting static spin order is
enhanced on the application of a magnetic field. [44, 45, 46] The spin
order within the vortex state of La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.10) [45]
indicates long in-plane correlation lengths, which are greater than both
the superconducting coherence length and the intervortex spacing at 14.5
T. As the coherence length is a measure of the size of the vortices,
Lake _et al._[45] argued that the static magnetism must therefore reside
beyond the extent of the vortices themselves. Whereas, the
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.095) correlation length for static spin order
is similarly long, the underlying physics is clearly different and the
spins appear to order independent of vortex creation.

## IV. Inelastic neutron scattering in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.095)

The magnetic excitations were studied in constant energy transfer scans
performed through the incommensurate ordering wave vectors. Horizontal
collimation sequences of 0.54^(∘)−0.48^(∘)−S−0.54^(∘)−1.2^(∘) and
0.54^(∘)−0.79^(∘)−S−0.85^(∘)−2.4^(∘) were used at energy transfers of
2.07 and 3.1 meV, respectively, which yield corresponding energy
resolutions of ∼1 and ∼1.5 meV FWHM. The representative scan along
(H, 0.5, 0) and ℏω=2.07 meV at T=30 K in Fig. 2(b) shows that the low
energy dynamic spin response peaks up at the same wave vector,
(0.5 ± 0.112, 0.5, 0), as the static spin structure. At higher energy
transfers, the signal rapidly declines. The measured dynamic structure
factor $S({\bf Q},\omega)$ is related to the imaginary part of the
dynamical susceptibility $\chi^{\prime\prime}({\bf Q},\omega)$ through
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. For quantitative analysis, the data
have been fit to the resolution convolution of
$S({\bf Q},\omega)$=$\chi^{\prime\prime}({\bf Q},\omega)[1-e^{-\hbar\omega k_{B}T}]^{-1}$,
where the susceptibility [33] is

$$\chi^{\prime\prime}({\bf Q},\hbar\omega)=\chi^{\prime\prime}(\hbar\,\omega) \sum_{n=1}^{4}\frac{\kappa}{({\bf Q}-{\bf Q}_{\delta\omega})^{2}+\kappa^{2}}$$
(1)

and ${\bf Q}_{\delta\mu}$ represents the four incommensurate wave
vectors ($\frac{1}{2}\pm\delta,\frac{1}{2},0$) and
($\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\pm\delta,0$). This assumes that the magnetic
excitations consist of four rods of scattering running along the c^(*)
axis. The extracted temperature dependences of χ^(′′)(ℏω), δ and κ are
plotted in Figs. 4(a)-4(c), respectively. χ^(′′)(ℏω) is proportional to
the integral of $\chi^{\prime\prime}({\bf Q},\omega)$ over ${\bf Q}$ in
the (H, K, 0) scattering plane, δ is the incommensurability, while κ is
the inverse of the static correlation length in the basal plane, which
is defined as the peak half width at half maximum. For reference, both
the spin ordering transition at T_(N)∼39.5 ± 0.3 K and the
superconducting transition near T_(C)∼27 K are indicated on this plot.
At both 2.07 and 3.1 meV, the dynamical susceptibility χ^(′′)(ℏω)
continuously increases as the temperature is reduced below ∼60 K, which
becomes roughly constant and nonzero below T_(C)∼27 K.

incommensurate magnetic scattering in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.095) at
(0.612,0.5,0) and (x=0.08) at (0.5,0.607,0), as well as that of (b) the
(0,1,0) structural Bragg peak, which marks the orthorhombic to low
temperature tetragonal structural phase transition. Note that a constant
background has been subtracted in both cases. The superconducting and
structural phase transition temperatures are indicated by dashed lines
for both samples. All of the data for x=0.08 have been scaled to the
volume of the x=0.095 sample by phonon normalization. The counting times
refer to the unscaled x=0.095 data. (c) Temperature dependence of the

₂CaCuO₄ (Ref. [48]) as one warms through the Neel temperature, at which
instantaneous spin correlations with the character of the Neel state
persist into the paramagnetic regime.[49]

The form of χ^(′′)(ℏω) dramatically varies as a function of doping in
the related La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ compounds. In the optimally and
slightly overdoped La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.15, 0.18) (Refs. [50] and
[51]), there is a characteristic energy of ∼7 meV below which the
dynamic susceptibility is dramatically reduced in the superconducting
state, which is the opening up of a spin gap. However, on the underdoped
side of the superconducting dome, there is a finite spectral weight in
the spin response at all low energy transfers.[52, 53]

The magnetic properties of the YBa₂Cu₃O_(6 + x) family show significant
differences from the La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ and La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄
systems, such as the absence of incommensurate elastic Bragg scattering.
Still, the YBa₂Cu₃O_(6 + x) system is well studied and a comparison can
be made to our measured low energy dynamic susceptibility in
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.095). Recent neutron scattering
measurements[19] on YBa₂Cu₃O_(6.5) with T_(C)=59 K ($x_{\rm eff}$∼ 0.09
for comparison to La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ and La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄) also
show a suppression of the dynamic susceptibility at the commensurate
(0.5,0.5) position below ∼15 meV. Measurements on the very underdoped
YBa₂Cu₃O_(6.35) (Ref. [20]) with T_(C)=18 K show a cone of spin
excitations out of the commensurate (0.5,0.5) position in reciprocal
space similar to that observed in insulating YBa₂Cu₃O_(6.15).[54]

The two bottom panels of Fig. 4 show that the incommensurability δ and
the inverse correlation length κ most strongly correlate with the
disappearance of the static spin order near T_(N)∼ 39 K, which is not
surprising. Above T_(N), the increase in κ may indicate that stripe
correlations are weakened by thermal fluctuations that broaden the hole
distribution about antiphase domain boundaries. As described in detail
in Ref. [55] and references therein, the appropriate functional form to
describe the scattering may depend on the dimensionality of the system,
as well as the disorder. However, using a Lorentzian form allows direct
comparison to related compounds.[29] Analysis using a Lorentzian
function raised to the power 3/2 gave qualitatively similar results.
Such a form has been observed in two dimensional random field Ising
model systems.[56]

## V Elastic neutron scattering in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.08)

Qualitatively, the magnetic and superconducting properties of
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (x=0.08) (T_(C)=29 K) are very similar to those of
the higher doped x=0.095 (T_(C)=27 K) sample. Elastic neutron scattering
measurements were carried out under the same conditions as described
earlier, with the single crystal oriented with (H, K, 0) in the
horizontal scattering plane. The elastic scattering scans at T=8 K (see
Fig. 5) show that the incommensurate wave vector has decreased from
δ=0.112(3) in the x=0.095 sample to 0.107(3). Surprisingly, the magnetic
scattering is roughly a factor of 8 less intense [Fig. 3(a)]. In Figs.
3(a) and 3(b), the intensities have been scaled to the sample volume by
using the integrated intensity of an acoustic phonon measured near a
strong

nuclear Bragg peak at (2,0.15,0). We do not understand the reduced
intensity for x = 0.08 since extinction does not play a role. Such a
reduction in the elastic scattering may also imply that the associated
inelastic scattering signal is prohibitively weak to be observed;
indeed, our attempts to observe it were unsuccessful.

The temperature dependence of the elastic magnetic signals at the
incommensurate wave vectors (0.5,0.607,0) for La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (_x_
= 0.08) and at (0.612,0.5,0) for La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ (_x_ = 0.095) are
reproduced in Fig. 6, wherein the intensities have been scaled so that
their functional form may be directly compared. As can be seen, both the
temperature dependence of the order parameter and the phase transition
temperatures are very similar despite the difference in the strengths of
the elastic magnetic Bragg scattering. We, therefore, conclude that the
two electronic energy scales for these crystals at x = 0.08 and x =
0.095, which are set by the superconducting T_(C) and T_(N), are
surprisingly similar. It is not clear why a 4

## VI Discussion

Whether magnetism and superconductivity coexist in the same microscopic
regions of the CuO₂ planes or are phase separated is a topical subject
of research. The issue of microscopic spatial segregation has been
examined by using a combination of neutron scattering [58] and μSR [59]
techniques in La₂CuO_(4 + y). As a local probe, μSR is sensitive to
heterogeneous structures. The magnetic ordering in LaCuO_(4 + y) (_y_ =
0.11) and La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ (_x_ = 0.12) has been reported to occur
in reduced magnetic volume fractions of 40

An interesting difference between the x = 0.08 and the 0.095
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ samples is that the spin ordered state in the x =
0.095 sample grows within a fully developed LTT structure as T_(N)∼39.5
K and T_(G2)∼45 K. By contrast, in the x = 0.08 La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄
sample, the MTO to LTT structural phase transition begins near T_(N) on
decreasing temperature and is only completed at temperatures below ∼20
K. The situation for x = 0.125 La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ is similar to the x
= 0.095 case, as T_(N)∼ 50 K, a temperature at which the MTO-LTT
transition for x = 0.125 is largely complete. The first order nature of
the MTO-LTT structural phase transition implies coexisting structures
over the temperature regime at which the spin order forms for x = 0.08
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄. It is then possible that the resulting structural
heterogeneity interferes with the full development of spin order, which
gives rise to a substantially reduced magnetic Bragg intensity as
compared to the x = 0.095 sample. However, we also note that variability
[45] in the elastic magnetic Bragg intensity has been reported from a
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ sample to a sample with similar nominal doping
levels of x ∼ 0.1 and the La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ system does not display
the LTT phase at low temperatures.

It is also interesting to examine the correlation between Ba-content x,
incommensurability δ, and superconducting T_(C) in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄
and compare these relationships to those reported for
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄. The top panel of Fig. 7 shows T_(C) vs δ for the x
= 0.08, 0.095, and 0.125 La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ samples, compared to those
measured in related La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ samples. As can be seen, our
results for the x = 0.08 and x = 0.095 samples give the same T_(C) as
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ for the same incommensuration δ. Of course,
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ displays the pronounced x = 1/8 anomaly, and
consequently, the x = 0.125 point on this T_(C) vs δ plot lies far below
the linear curve, which is an excellent descriptor for the remainder of
the underdoped La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ and La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ systems.
The abrupt nature of the x = 1/8 anomaly in the LBCO system is clear.

The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows the incommensurability δ vs Ba-content
x, and once again, we compare our new

results on x=0.08 and x=0.095 La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ samples to the
x=0.125 La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ results and those of several underdoped
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ samples at Sr concentrations above x =0.05, where
the incommensurate spin ordering is consistent with a picture of
parallel (as opposed to diagonal) stripe ordering. In this Sr-content
regime, δ tracks x well, assuming a stoichiometric oxygen content.[21,
22, 24, 36] One can see that the incommensuration in x=0.08 and x=0.095
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ shows relatively little x dependence. Indeed, we
observe δ values that are only ∼9

It is possible that this difference between underdoped
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄ and La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ also arises due to the
MTO-LTT structural phase transition that occurs in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄
but is absent in La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄. It is also conceivable that it
arises due to some small oxygen off stoichiometry, such that our samples
have the composition La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO_(4 + γ), with an oxygen
stoichiometry greater than 4. Such excess oxygen would give rise to an
effective hole doping given by $x_{\rm eff}$=x+2y. To bring the δ values
for x =0.08 and 0.095 back onto the linear relationship between δ and
$x_{\rm eff}$ seen in La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄, small, but positive values
of y such as 0.013 and 0.0075 for the x=0.08 and x=0.095
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO_(4 + γ) samples, respectively, would be required.
This is too small to be detectable and runs counter to what is concluded
in La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO_(4 + γ). In the underdoped
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO_(4 + γ), the superconducting T_(C) is maximized by
annealing in oxygen, at which point the measured δ vs Sr concentration x
lie on the straight line.[36] Consequently, as grown
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO_(4 + γ) tends to be oxygen deficient (y< 0) and
annealing in oxygen results in stoichiometric La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄. This
is also expected to be true for underdoped La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO_(4 + γ),
which would imply that the deviation of δ vs x from a linear
relationship is intrinsic to stoichiometric La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄, which
is a surprising result.

## VII VII. Summary and conclusions

We have observed the coexistence of static, two dimensional
incommensurate spin order and superconductivity in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄
with x=0.095 and x=0.08. This result is in broad agreement with other
well studied high temperature La-214 cuprate superconductors, such as
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ or La₂CuO_(4 + γ), which show signatures of either
incommensurate static spin ordering or dynamic spin correlations. One
significant finding of this study is the field _independence_ of the
incommensurate magnetic order in the x=0.095 sample in marked contrast
to the other superconducting La-214 cuprates. Studies of the spin
ordering as a function of magnetic field in other superconducting
systems with large magnetic volume fractions should prove illuminating.
In addition, while the dependence of the superconducting T_(C) on the
incommensuration of the magnetic structure δ in La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄
(x=0.08, 0.095) is the same as that observed in La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄,
the x dependence appears to be substantially weaker than that seen in
La_(2 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄, wherein a linear relationship is observed over
this range of concentration. Now that crystal growth breakthroughs have
resulted in the availability of large, high quality single crystals of
La_(2 − x)Ba_(x)CuO₄, fuller experimental characterization of the
original family of high temperature superconductors is clearly
warranted.
