###### Abstract

We herein describe our investigation of the superconducting and magnetic properties of the rare-earth ternary germanide intermetallic compounds La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. Single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} were synthesized using the high-temperature metal wire method. Both types of crystal formed in a U_{2}Co_{3}Si_{5}-type orthorhombic structure (space group Ibahn). La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} showed the onset of superconducting phase transition at T_{c} = 8.1 K, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest T_{c} of all the R_{2}M_{3}X_{5} (R = rare-earth elements, M = transition metal, and X = s-p metal) superconductors, and from the specific heat data, it was found to have multigap superconductivity. Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} showed both a superconducting phase transition at T_{c} = 7.8 K and two antiferromagnetic transitions at T_{N1} = 3.5 K and T_{N2} = 4.2 K, which indicates the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism. However, the correlation between the superconductivity and the magnetism was too weak to be observed. In its normal state, Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} revealed strong magnetic anisotropy, probably due to the crystalline electric field effect.

## I Introduction

R_{2}T_{3}X_{5} (R = rare-earth elements, M = transition metal, and X = s-p metal, also known as "235 compounds") have been investigated for decades, because of their interesting magnetic [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and superconducting properties. [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] Most magnetic 235 compounds exhibit a number of interesting properties, such as antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] metamagnetic phase transition (MMT), [5, 6] high magnetoresistance (MR), [6, 10] the crystalline electric field effect (CEF), [4, 12] Kondo lattice, [14, 10, 11, 12] and heavy-fermion (HF) behavior. [5, 10, 14] These interesting characteristics lead these compounds to studies of various novel ground states by the substitution of different elements in them. For example, Ce_{2}Rh_{3}Ge_{5} shows AF ordering with HF behavior, and Pr_{2}Rh_{3}Ge_{5} shows HF behavior without any phase transition, while Pr_{2}Pd_{3}Ge_{5} only shows AF ordering and MMT. [5, 6, 10] Moreover, superconductivity occurs when pressure is applied to Ce_{2}Ni_{3}Ge_{5}, which has AF ordering, and reentrant superconducting behavior is observed in Tm_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5}, where AF ordering affects the superconductivity. [13, 14] Among the superconducting 235 compounds, Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5} has been the focus of particularly intensive research because of its relatively high superconducting phase transition temperature of T_{c}\sim 6 K and its two-gap superconducting structure. [17] More recently, fully opened superconducting gaps were confirmed by measuring specific heat, [18] penetration depth, [19] and thermal conductivity. [20] Furthermore, different anisotropies of the two bands in Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5} was also recently reported. [21] Because of their various interesting properties, the search for new 235 compounds that might possess higher T_{c} with magnetic ordering is of great importance to the study of superconductivity, magnetism and the relationship between them.

In the compound R_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5}, Fe atoms have no magnetic moment, but rather build large densities of states at the Fermi level, [13] we were therefore motivated to induce a larger density of the d-state by substituting Pt in the Fe sites. In the present study, we report the discovery of superconductivity (possibly with multigap) in La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, which has the highest transition temperature (T_{c} = 8.1 K) of all the 235 compounds, and we also show that Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} has both superconductivity at T_{c} = 7.8 K and AF orderings at T_{N1} = 3.5 K and T_{N2} = 4.2 K, which indicates the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} were grown by the high-temperature flux method using a Pt-Ge mixture as a self-flux. Pieces of La (99.9%)[or Pr(99.9%)], Pt (99.99%), and Ge (99.999%) were placed in an alumina crucible in an atomic ratio of La (or Pr) : Pt : Ge = 1 : 4 : 20. The crucibles were sealed in quartz tubes under a pressure of 1/3 atm of Ar gas and placed vertically in a programmable box furnace. The furnace was heated at a rate of 200 degC per hour to 1130 degC, maintained at 1130 degC for 40 hours, and then cooled to 850 degC at a rate of 3 degC per hour. As a result, we obtained shiny single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} (the insets of Fig. 1) after separating the grown crystals from the flux using a centrifuge with quartz wool as a filter. The characterization of crystals was performed using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku, RINT2000), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4700), and energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX; Horiba 7200-H) spectroscopy. XRD was performed at room temperature and the unit cell parameters were refined using powbrecell software; the alignment of the samples was confirmed using XRD techniques. Temperature- and field-dependent magnetizations of single crystals were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (SQUID; Quantum Design MPMS XL). Electrical resistivity was measured using a four-probe method with a LR700 resistance bridge, combined with a SQUID temperature control system. Heat capacity was measured using a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS), together with the relaxation technique.

  

## III Results and discussion

Several crystals were pulverized in order to obtain powder XRD results for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} (see Fig. 1). The structure of the compounds were formed in U_{2}Co_{3}Si_{3}-type orthorhombic structure (space group Ibam). By refining the powder XRD data, the lattice parameters were determined to be a=10.1508(5) A, b=12.0300(2) A, and c=6.2709(2) A for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, and a=10.1333(5) A, b=11.8600(1) A, and c=6.2288(6) A for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The insets of Fig. 1 show the morphological shape of the single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. SEM images showed large flat surfaces with minor impurities on the surface of each sample (not shown here), and a quantitative analysis of the EDX spectra was used to estimate the composition of La_{2,1}Pt_{2.8}Ge_{5.1} and Pr_{2,1}Pt_{2.9}Ge_{5.0}, which were close to the ideal chemical compositions of the crystals within an acceptable margin of error.

The temperature-dependent magnetization of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} single crystals was measured and plotted in Fig. 2. Measurements of magnetization were performed with H=10 Oe with zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling warmup (FCW) processes with the field parallel and perpendicular to the a axis for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and to the c axis for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}; see Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. Bulk superconductivity was confirmed in both compounds and the superconducting transition temperatures were found to be T_{c}=8.1 K for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and T_{c}=7.8 K for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. Interestingly, these values of T_{c} are very similar to those of other R-Pt-Ge ternary compounds, LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (T_{c}=8.3 K) and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} (T_{c}=7.9 K).[22] It may be seen that both La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} are typical type-II superconductors with low H_{c1} values, and that relatively large magnetic anisotropy was observed in Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, while no anisotropy was seen in La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, as shown in the insets of Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Isothermal magnetization was measured as a function of the magnetic field at T=2 K for single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. In the ab plane of Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, there are magnetic phase transitions around H=18 and 24 kOe [see Fig. 3(b)], and the Meissner effect and vortex pinning may be seen in the low-field region [the inset of Fig. 3(b)]. We also observed magnetic hysteresis around H=18 kOe, which implies a first order phase transition. The saturated magnetic moment at H=5 T (M_{s}\approx 1\mu_{\rm B}) is smaller than the theoretical Hund's rule ground state, g\mu_{B}J for an isolated Pr^{3+} ion (3.58\,\mu_{\rm B}/\rm Pr^{3+}), which is similar to the isostructural compounds, Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and

The insets in (a) and (b) show the morphology of single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, respectively.

 \rm Pr_{2}Ni_{3}Ge_{5}.[5, 6] We believe that such a large magnetic anisotropy as well as low M_{\rm z} value (\approx1\mu_{\rm B}) is probably due to the CEF effect.

Figure 4(a) shows the dc magnetization divided by the magnetic field, in the low-temperature region, and Fig. 4(b) shows the inverse dc magnetization divided by the magnetic field, in terms of temperature at H = 1 kOe with the field parallel (H\parallelc) and perpendicular (H\parallelab) to the c axis for \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. In Fig. 4(a), the magnetization in the ab plane was found to be larger than that along the c axis. For H\parallelab, magnetic phase transitions were observed at T_{N1} = 3.5 K and T_{N2} = 4.2 K, while the diamagnetic superconducting signal was observed near T_{N1} = 3.5 K for H\parallelc. By measuring the ZFC and FCW processes in the ab plane at H = 1 kOe, we were able to observe magnetic hysteresis because of the Meissner effect. It is therefore likely that magnetic ordering and superconductivity coexist with magnetic anisotropy in single crystals of \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. The quite similar magnetic characteristics of anisotropy and two magnetic transitions was also observed in \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, indicating that the two compounds of \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and \rm Pr_{2}Pd_{3}Ge_{5} have the almost same magnetic structure, although the former is superconducting and the latter is not.[5] In Fig. 4(b), the magnetizations for both directions follow the temperature dependence of the Curie Weiss law at high temperatures (150 K \leqslantT\leqslant 300 K). By fitting the data to the Curie Weiss law, the effective magnetic moment was estimated to be \mu_{\rm eff}(H\parallelc) = 3.69 \mu_{\rm B}/\rm Pr and \mu_{\rm eff}(H\parallelab) = 3.65 \mu_{\rm B}/\rm Pr for the field parallel and perpendicular to the c axis, respectively. The values are comparable to the \mu_{\rm eff} values for an isolated \rm Pr^{3+} ion. The Weiss temperatures were also estimated to be \theta(H\parallelc) = -40.35 K and \theta(H\parallelab) = -54.63 K. The large difference between \theta(H\parallelc) and \theta(H\parallelab), and the anisotropy below T\leqslant 150 K, as shown in Fig. 3(b), are believed to be due to the CEF effect, where the environmental charges around \rm Pr^{3+} ions produce a local electric field.

Figure 5 shows the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity in a zero field, with a current parallel to the ab plane for \rm La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and to the c axis for \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. The resistivity in the normal state exhibits metallic behavior in the temperature range 9 K \leqslantT\leqslant 300 K for both compounds. The inset of Fig. 5 is an expanded plot in the low temperature region, which shows the superconducting phase transitions

  at T_{c}=8.1 and 7.8 K for single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, respectively, which is consistent with the transition temperatures obtained from the M-T data. For Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, the resistivity below the superconducting transition shows no discernible change, i.e., reentrance behavior, at T=T_{N1} or T_{N2}. We therefore envisage that the magnetic fluctuation near the AF ordering does not disturb the superconductivity in this compound, probably due to the weak interaction between the superconductivity and the magnetism. In addition, the weak interaction is likely to make the superconducting state coexist with a large localized magnetic moments of Pr^{3+} ions.

Specific heat data (C_{p}) were obtained for samples with masses of 32.0 mg for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and 14.7 mg for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. The results are shown in Fig. 6(a) in which sharp peaks may be seen at T_{N1}=3.4 K and T_{N2}=4.1 K for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, which correspond to the magnetic transition temperatures from the M-T curve in Fig. 4(a). However, we observed no noticeable superconducting jump either around T_{c}=8.1 K in La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, or around 7.8 K in Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. In order to verify the superconducting jump at T=T_{c}, we obtained the temperature-dependent C_{p}(T) in the normal state under a magnetic field of H=2 T, which is higher than H_{c2} at T=2 K, and subtracted them from the C_{p} data in the superconducting state without magnetic field. Figure 6(b) shows the electronic specific heat coefficient of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} at zero magnetic field, i.e., C_{\rm el}/T divided by \gamma_{n}, plotted in terms of T/T_{c}. The specific heat jump at zero field (\Delta C) relative to the normal state specific heat (C_{n}), \Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c} at T_{c} is 0.36, which is much smaller than the value of 1.43 obtained from BCS theory.

In the inset of Fig. 6(b), we show a conventional Debye fit to the normal state data in the temperature range 2 K \leqslant T\leqslant 10 K using C_{p}=C_{\rm el}+C_{\rm ph}=\gamma_{n}T+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5}, with the normal state specific heat coefficient \gamma_{n} and the coefficients of the phononic contribution \beta and \delta. The parameters obtained are \gamma_{n}=4.65 mJ mol^{-1}K^{-2}, \beta=1.18 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4}, and \delta=1.03\times 10^{-2} mJ mol^{-1} K^{-6}. The large T^{5} term observed in the normal state specific heat indicates a complex phonon density of states, which is similar to the case of single crystals of Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5}[17, 18] and supports the possibility of multigap superconductivity.

The reduced jump in heat capacity data is similar to that of Lu_{2}Fe_{2}Si_{5}, which was verified to have two-gap superconductivity. \Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c}. In addition, the almost linear temperature dependence of C_{\rm el}/T below T_{c} does not represent the behavior of a conventional BCS-type single gap but is rather an indication of a superconducting multigap. These two characteristics are also similar to the compound LiFeAs, which has a two-gap structure.[23, 24] We also found that the superconducting phase transition temperature of T_{c}=7.7 K in the measurement of C_{p} was lower than the magnetic and electrical value of T_{c}=8.1 K. This characteristic of different values of T_{c} obtained using magnetic and thermodynamic measurement was also reported for LiFeAs.[24] It is therefore seems likely that both compounds La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} have multigap superconductivity.

Inset of (b): Specific heat of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} with applied field of H=2 T. The solid line is an estimated normal state specific heat from a polynomial form (see the text).

  There are other possible origins for the the reduced normalized jump at T_{c} and the linear term below T_{c}, such as impurity and inhomogeneity. However, we could not observe any noticeable impurities in EDX measurement but the good crystallization of the samples by single crystal XRD measurement. Moreover, bulk superconductivity was confirmed from magnetization measurement (see Fig. 2), i.e., over 70% of the volume fraction with H=10 Oe for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} single crystal along the a axis and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} single crystal along the c-axis, respectively. Even if we assume that there is a 30% of inhomogeneous phases which is not superconducting, the jump in the heat capacity measurement at T_{c} is much smaller than expected value. It would be of great interest to measure specific heat at low temperatures in order to understand the symmetry of the superconducting gap in more detail.

The magnetic moment of Pr as extracted from the Curie-Weiss law, Fig. 4(b), suggests nearly free Pr ions, which is in marked contrast with the moment seen at low temperatures, e.g., the magnetization would seem to saturate at a value close to 1\mu_{B}, Fig. 3(b), considerably smaller than the free magnetic moment of Pr. This suggests Kondo screening of the magnetic moments, and therefore the development of a Kondo lattice, in other words that this compound should behave as a heavy-fermion compound. But this is at odds with the very small \gamma_{u} coefficient extracted from heat capacity measurements, Fig. 6. The obvious conclusion is that the small moment is likely due to the particular crystalline electric field scheme of this compound. Therefore the Pr moment behave as nearly localized moments even in the low-temperature limit where superconductivity emerges. Superconducting state might coexist with such a large local moment likely due to weak interaction between superconducting pairs and local magnetic moments. The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism can be found in many magnetic superconducting compounds. For example, ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, which is one of the well-known borocarbide superconductors, has superconducting transition at T_{c}=10.5 K and antiferromagnetic ordering temperature at T_{N}=5.85 K, where Er has larger value of free magnetic moment than Pr.[25]

## IV Summary

Single crystals of the ternary germanide superconductors La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} were successfully fabricated using a metal self-flux method. Magnetization, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity were measured with the field along specific crystallographic directions. La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} exhibited the onset of a superconducting phase transition at T_{c}=8.1 K, which is the highest T_{c} of all the 235-type superconductors. Measurement of specific heat showed that there was substantial evidence of multigap superconductivity, such as the small value (=0.36) of \Delta C/\gamma_{u}T_{c}, the linear decrease of superconducting electronic specific heat, and a complex phonon density of states. Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} shows the coexistence of superconductivity (T_{c}=7.8 K) and an antiferromagnetically ordered state (T_{N1}=3.5 K and T_{N2}=4.2 K), and no observable correlation between superconductivity and magnetism.

###### Abstract

We herein describe our investigation of the superconducting and magnetic properties of the rare-earth ternary germanide intermetallic compounds La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. Single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} were synthesized using the high-temperature metal wire method.

La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} showed the onset of superconducting phase transition at T_{c} = 8.1 K, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest T_{c} of all the R_{2}M_{3}X_{5} (R = rare-earth elements, M = transition metal, and X = s-p metal) superconductors, and from the specific heat data, it was found to have multigap superconductivity. Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} showed both a superconducting phase transition at T_{c} = 7.8 K and two antiferromagnetic transitions at T_{N1} = 3.5 K and T_{N2} = 4.2 K, which indicates the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism. However, the correlation between the superconductivity and the magnetism was too weak to be observed. In its normal state, Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} revealed strong magnetic anisotropy, probably due to the crystalline electric field effect.

## I Introduction

R_{2}T_{3}X_{5} (R = rare-earth elements, M = transition metal, and X = s-p metal, also known as "235 compounds") have been investigated for decades, because of their interesting magnetic [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and superconducting properties. [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] Most magnetic 235 compounds exhibit a number of interesting properties, such as antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] metamagnetic phase transition (MMT), [5, 6] high magnetoresistance (MR), [6, 10] the crystalline electric field effect (CEF), [4, 12] Kondo lattice, [14, 10, 11, 12] and heavy-fermion (HF) behavior. [5, 10, 14] These interesting characteristics lead these compounds to studies of various novel ground states by the substitution of different elements in them. For example, Ce_{2}Rh_{3}Ge_{5} shows AF ordering with HF behavior, and Pr_{2}Rh_{3}Ge_{5} shows HF behavior without any phase transition, while Pr_{2}Pd_{3}Ge_{5} only shows AF ordering and MMT. [5, 6, 10] Moreover, superconductivity occurs when pressure is applied to Ce_{2}Ni_{3}Ge_{5}, which has AF ordering, and reentrant superconducting behavior is observed in Tm_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5}, where AF ordering affects the superconductivity. [13, 14] Among the superconducting 235 compounds, Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5} has been the focus of particularly intensive research because of its relatively high superconducting phase transition temperature of T_{c}\sim 6 K and its two-gap superconducting structure. [17] More recently, fully opened superconducting gaps were confirmed by measuring specific heat, [18] penetration depth, [19] and thermal conductivity. [20] Furthermore, different anisotropies of the two bands in Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5} was also recently reported. [21] Because of their various interesting properties, the search for new 235 compounds that might possess higher T_{c} with magnetic ordering is of great importance to the study of superconductivity, magnetism and the relationship between them.

In the compound R_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5}, Fe atoms have no magnetic moment, but rather build large densities of states at the Fermi level, [13] we were therefore motivated to induce a larger density of the d-state by substituting Pt in the Fe sites. In the present study, we report the discovery of superconductivity (possibly with multigap) in La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, which has the highest transition temperature (T_{c} = 8.1 K) of all the 235 compounds, and we also show that Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} has both superconductivity at T_{c} = 7.8 K and AF orderings at T_{N1} = 3.5 K and T_{N2} = 4.2 K, which indicates the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} were grown by the high-temperature flux method using a Pt-Ge mixture as a self-flux. Pieces of La (99.9%)[or Pr(99.9%)], Pt (99.99%), and Ge (99.999%) were placed in an alumina crucible in an atomic ratio of La (or Pr) : Pt : Ge = 1 : 4 : 20. The crucibles were sealed in quartz tubes under a pressure of 1/3 atm of Ar gas and placed vertically in a programmable box furnace. The furnace was heated at a rate of 200 degC per hour to 1130 degC, maintained at 1130 degC for 40 hours, and then cooled to 850 degC at a rate of 3 degC per hour. As a result, we obtained shiny single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} (the insets of Fig. 1) after separating the grown crystals from the flux using a centrifuge with quartz wool as a filter. The characterization of crystals was performed using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku, RINT2000), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S-4700), and energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX; Horiba 7200-H) spectroscopy. XRD was performed at room temperature and the unit cell parameters were refined using powbrecell software; the alignment of the samples was confirmed using XRD techniques. Temperature- and field-dependent magnetizations of single crystals were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (SQUID; Quantum Design MPMS XL). Electrical resistivity was measured using a four-probe method with a LR700 resistance bridge, combined with a SQUID temperature control system. Heat capacity was measured using a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS), together with the relaxation technique.

  

## III Results and discussion

Several crystals were pulverized in order to obtain powder XRD results for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} (see Fig. 1). The structure of the compounds were formed in U_{2}Co_{3}Si_{3}-type orthorhombic structure (space group Ibam). By refining the powder XRD data, the lattice parameters were determined to be a=10.1508(5) A, b=12.0300(2) A, and c=6.2709(2) A for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, and a=10.1333(5) A, b=11.8600(1) A, and c=6.2288(6) A for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The insets of Fig. 1 show the morphological shape of the single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. SEM images showed large flat surfaces with minor impurities on the surface of each sample (not shown here), and a quantitative analysis of the EDX spectra was used to estimate the composition of La_{2,1}Pt_{2.8}Ge_{5.1} and Pr_{2,1}Pt_{2.9}Ge_{5.0}, which were close to the ideal chemical compositions of the crystals within an acceptable margin of error.

The temperature-dependent magnetization of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} single crystals was measured and plotted in Fig. 2. Measurements of magnetization were performed with H=10 Oe with zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling warmup (FCW) processes with the field parallel and perpendicular to the a axis for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and to the c axis for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}; see Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. Bulk superconductivity was confirmed in both compounds and the superconducting transition temperatures were found to be T_{c}=8.1 K for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and T_{c}=7.8 K for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. Interestingly, these values of T_{c} are very similar to those of other R-Pt-Ge ternary compounds, LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (T_{c}=8.3 K) and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} (T_{c}=7.9 K).[22] It may be seen that both La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} are typical type-II superconductors with low H_{c1} values, and that relatively large magnetic anisotropy was observed in Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, while no anisotropy was seen in La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, as shown in the insets of Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). Isothermal magnetization was measured as a function of the magnetic field at T=2 K for single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. In the ab plane of Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, there are magnetic phase transitions around H=18 and 24 kOe [see Fig. 3(b)], and the Meissner effect and vortex pinning may be seen in the low-field region [the inset of Fig. 3(b)]. We also observed magnetic hysteresis around H=18 kOe, which implies a first order phase transition. The saturated magnetic moment at H=5 T (M_{s}\approx 1\mu_{\rm B}) is smaller than the theoretical Hund's rule ground state, g\mu_{B}J for an isolated Pr^{3+} ion (3.58\,\mu_{\rm B}/\rm Pr^{3+}), which is similar to the isostructural compounds, Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and

The insets in (a) and (b) show the morphology of single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, respectively.

 \rm Pr_{2}Ni_{3}Ge_{5}.[5, 6] We believe that such a large magnetic anisotropy as well as low M_{\rm z} value (\approx1\mu_{\rm B}) is probably due to the CEF effect.

Figure 4(a) shows the dc magnetization divided by the magnetic field, in the low-temperature region, and Fig. 4(b) shows the inverse dc magnetization divided by the magnetic field, in terms of temperature at H = 1 kOe with the field parallel (H\parallelc) and perpendicular (H\parallelab) to the c axis for \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. In Fig. 4(a), the magnetization in the ab plane was found to be larger than that along the c axis. For H\parallelab, magnetic phase transitions were observed at T_{N1} = 3.5 K and T_{N2} = 4.2 K, while the diamagnetic superconducting signal was observed near T_{N1} = 3.5 K for H\parallelc. By measuring the ZFC and FCW processes in the ab plane at H = 1 kOe, we were able to observe magnetic hysteresis because of the Meissner effect. It is therefore likely that magnetic ordering and superconductivity coexist with magnetic anisotropy in single crystals of \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. The quite similar magnetic characteristics of anisotropy and two magnetic transitions was also observed in \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, indicating that the two compounds of \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and \rm Pr_{2}Pd_{3}Ge_{5} have the almost same magnetic structure, although the former is superconducting and the latter is not.[5] In Fig. 4(b), the magnetizations for both directions follow the temperature dependence of the Curie Weiss law at high temperatures (150 K \leqslantT\leqslant 300 K). By fitting the data to the Curie Weiss law, the effective magnetic moment was estimated to be \mu_{\rm eff}(H\parallelc) = 3.69 \mu_{\rm B}/\rm Pr and \mu_{\rm eff}(H\parallelab) = 3.65 \mu_{\rm B}/\rm Pr for the field parallel and perpendicular to the c axis, respectively. The values are comparable to the \mu_{\rm eff} values for an isolated \rm Pr^{3+} ion. The Weiss temperatures were also estimated to be \theta(H\parallelc) = -40.35 K and \theta(H\parallelab) = -54.63 K. The large difference between \theta(H\parallelc) and \theta(H\parallelab), and the anisotropy below T\leqslant 150 K, as shown in Fig. 3(b), are believed to be due to the CEF effect, where the environmental charges around \rm Pr^{3+} ions produce a local electric field.

Figure 5 shows the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity in a zero field, with a current parallel to the ab plane for \rm La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and to the c axis for \rm Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. The resistivity in the normal state exhibits metallic behavior in the temperature range 9 K \leqslantT\leqslant 300 K for both compounds. The inset of Fig. 5 is an expanded plot in the low temperature region, which shows the superconducting phase transitions

  at T_{c}=8.1 and 7.8 K for single crystals of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, respectively, which is consistent with the transition temperatures obtained from the M-T data. For Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, the resistivity below the superconducting transition shows no discernible change, i.e., reentrance behavior, at T=T_{N1} or T_{N2}. We therefore envisage that the magnetic fluctuation near the AF ordering does not disturb the superconductivity in this compound, probably due to the weak interaction between the superconductivity and the magnetism. In addition, the weak interaction is likely to make the superconducting state coexist with a large localized magnetic moments of Pr^{3+} ions.

Specific heat data (C_{p}) were obtained for samples with masses of 32.0 mg for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and 14.7 mg for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. The results are shown in Fig. 6(a) in which sharp peaks may be seen at T_{N1}=3.4 K and T_{N2}=4.1 K for Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, which correspond to the magnetic transition temperatures from the M-T curve in Fig. 4(a). However, we observed no noticeable superconducting jump either around T_{c}=8.1 K in La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}, or around 7.8 K in Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5}. In order to verify the superconducting jump at T=T_{c}, we obtained the temperature-dependent C_{p}(T) in the normal state under a magnetic field of H=2 T, which is higher than H_{c2} at T=2 K, and subtracted them from the C_{p} data in the superconducting state without magnetic field. Figure 6(b) shows the electronic specific heat coefficient of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} at zero magnetic field, i.e., C_{\rm el}/T divided by \gamma_{n}, plotted in terms of T/T_{c}. The specific heat jump at zero field (\Delta C) relative to the normal state specific heat (C_{n}), \Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c} at T_{c} is 0.36, which is much smaller than the value of 1.43 obtained from BCS theory.

In the inset of Fig. 6(b), we show a conventional Debye fit to the normal state data in the temperature range 2 K \leqslant T\leqslant 10 K using C_{p}=C_{\rm el}+C_{\rm ph}=\gamma_{n}T+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5}, with the normal state specific heat coefficient \gamma_{n} and the coefficients of the phononic contribution \beta and \delta. The parameters obtained are \gamma_{n}=4.65 mJ mol^{-1}K^{-2}, \beta=1.18 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4}, and \delta=1.03\times 10^{-2} mJ mol^{-1} K^{-6}. The large T^{5} term observed in the normal state specific heat indicates a complex phonon density of states, which is similar to the case of single crystals of Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5}[17, 18] and supports the possibility of multigap superconductivity.

The reduced jump in heat capacity data is similar to that of Lu_{2}Fe_{2}Si_{5}, which was verified to have two-gap superconductivity. \Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c}. In addition, the almost linear temperature dependence of C_{\rm el}/T below T_{c} does not represent the behavior of a conventional BCS-type single gap but is rather an indication of a superconducting multigap. These two characteristics are also similar to the compound LiFeAs, which has a two-gap structure.[23, 24] We also found that the superconducting phase transition temperature of T_{c}=7.7 K in the measurement of C_{p} was lower than the magnetic and electrical value of T_{c}=8.1 K. This characteristic of different values of T_{c} obtained using magnetic and thermodynamic measurement was also reported for LiFeAs.[24] It is therefore seems likely that both compounds La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} have multigap superconductivity.

Inset of (b): Specific heat of La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} with applied field of H=2 T. The solid line is an estimated normal state specific heat from a polynomial form (see the text).

  There are other possible origins for the the reduced normalized jump at T_{c} and the linear term below T_{c}, such as impurity and inhomogeneity. However, we could not observe any noticeable impurities in EDX measurement but the good crystallization of the samples by single crystal XRD measurement. Moreover, bulk superconductivity was confirmed from magnetization measurement (see Fig. 2), i.e., over 70% of the volume fraction with H=10 Oe for La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} single crystal along the a axis and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} single crystal along the c-axis, respectively. Even if we assume that there is a 30% of inhomogeneous phases which is not superconducting, the jump in the heat capacity measurement at T_{c} is much smaller than expected value. It would be of great interest to measure specific heat at low temperatures in order to understand the symmetry of the superconducting gap in more detail.

The magnetic moment of Pr as extracted from the Curie-Weiss law, Fig. 4(b), suggests nearly free Pr ions, which is in marked contrast with the moment seen at low temperatures, e.g., the magnetization would seem to saturate at a value close to 1\mu_{B}, Fig. 3(b), considerably smaller than the free magnetic moment of Pr. This suggests Kondo screening of the magnetic moments, and therefore the development of a Kondo lattice, in other words that this compound should behave as a heavy-fermion compound. But this is at odds with the very small \gamma_{u} coefficient extracted from heat capacity measurements, Fig. 6. The obvious conclusion is that the small moment is likely due to the particular crystalline electric field scheme of this compound. Therefore the Pr moment behave as nearly localized moments even in the low-temperature limit where superconductivity emerges. Superconducting state might coexist with such a large local moment likely due to weak interaction between superconducting pairs and local magnetic moments. The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism can be found in many magnetic superconducting compounds. For example, ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, which is one of the well-known borocarbide superconductors, has superconducting transition at T_{c}=10.5 K and antiferromagnetic ordering temperature at T_{N}=5.85 K, where Er has larger value of free magnetic moment than Pr.[25]

## IV Summary

Single crystals of the ternary germanide superconductors La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} and Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} were successfully fabricated using a metal self-flux method. Magnetization, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity were measured with the field along specific crystallographic directions. La_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} exhibited the onset of a superconducting phase transition at T_{c}=8.1 K, which is the highest T_{c} of all the 235-type superconductors. Measurement of specific heat showed that there was substantial evidence of multigap superconductivity, such as the small value (=0.36) of \Delta C/\gamma_{u}T_{c}, the linear decrease of superconducting electronic specific heat, and a complex phonon density of states. Pr_{2}Pt_{3}Ge_{5} shows the coexistence of superconductivity (T_{c}=7.8 K) and an antiferromagnetically ordered state (T_{N1}=3.5 K and T_{N2}=4.2 K), and no observable correlation between superconductivity and magnetism.
