###### Abstract

We report magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and heat capacity
measurements on single crystals of the Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ and
Sr_(1 − y)Eu_(y)(Fe_(0.88)Co_(0.12))₂As₂ series. The optimal Co
concentration for superconductivity in Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ is
determined to be x ∼ 0.12. On the basis of this, we grew members of the
Sr_(1 − y)Eu_(y)(Fe_(0.88)Co_(0.12))₂As₂ series so as to examine the
effects of well-defined, local magnetic moments on the superconducting
state. We show that superconductivity is gradually suppressed by
paramagnetic Eu²⁺ doping and coexists with antiferromagnetic ordering of
Eu²⁺ as long as T_(c) > T_(N). For y ≥ 0.65, T_(N) crosses T_(c) and the
superconducting ground state (as manifested by zero resistivity)
abruptly disappears with evidence for competition between
superconductivity and local moment antiferromagnetism for y up to 0.72.
It is speculated that the suppression of the antiferromagnetic
fluctuations of the Fe sublattice by coupling to the long-range order of
the Eu²⁺ sublattice destroys bulk superconductivity when T_(N) > T_(c).

## I Introduction

The interplay between superconductivity (SC) and magnetism has been of a
long-standing interest in condensed matter physics. SC and magnetism
were originally considered to be mutually exclusive in conventional
superconductors because magnetism breaks the time-reversal symmetry of
the singlet Cooper pairs. The influence of paramagnetic impurities on SC
was first studied theoretically by Abrikosov and Gor’kov (AG).[1] It was
shown that SC is drastically suppressed by dilute magnetic moments due
to the spin-flip scattering. Early experimental investigations were
limited to superconducting systems without long-range magnetic order.[2,
3, 4] The coexistence of SC and long-range magnetism was realized in
several families of ternary and quaternary rare-earth compounds
discovered later, also referred to as magnetic superconductors, e.g.,
RMo₆S₈, RRh₄B₄, and RNi₂B₂C.[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] In these compounds,
the localized 4f electrons of the rare-earth ions are indirectly coupled
via conduction electrons by the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
interaction and responsible for various magnetic orderings. The
conduction electrons, often primarily from the transition metal, give
rise to SC. The coexistence is more favorable for antiferromagnetism
(AF) since the AF molecular field exerted on SC electrons may be
averaged out on the scale of SC coherence length.

Another type of magnetic superconductor is the one in which the moment
is itinerant. In itinerant electron systems, long-range order may be
carried by the same electrons that become superconducting, leading to
competition (sometimes strong) between the two states. The recently
discovered iron-arsenic-based superconductors appear to be one such
example. The parent compounds (RFeAsO 1111 series, R= La, Ce, Pr, Nd,
Sm, or Gd, and AFe₂As₂ 122 series, alkali earth A= Ca, Sr, and Ba) are
semimetals and show either closely spaced or a simultaneous AF ordering
and tetragonal to orthorhombic (ortho) structural transition. With
electron or hole doping, the magnetic and structural transitions are
suppressed to low temperature, and SC, with T_(c) up to 55 K,[12] is
induced. Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (Ref. [13]) exhibits a maximum T_(c) of
37 K, or by substitution of transition metal for Fe, e.g.,
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂, T_(c) can reach 22 K (Refs. [14, 15, 16]), or
for Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂, T_(c) can reach 18 K.[17] Unlike the 111
series for which the magnetic and structural transition was suggested to
disappear abruptly prior to the emergence of SC, the 122 series show a
gradual suppression of the AF (ortho) transition, which coexists with SC
for a range of dopings.[15, 16] For the Co-doped Ba-122 series, neutron
scattering shows a suppression of the magnetic order parameter on
entering the superconducting state, indicating strong coupling between
AF and SC.[15, 18] In addition, both μ SR (Refs. [19] and [20]) and ⁷⁵As
NMR (Ref. [21]) measurements unambiguously indicate that AF order is
present in all of the sample volumes when the sample is in the
superconducting state, i.e., that the magnetic order and SC coexist
homogeneously at the atomic scale. Whereas Fe-based AF coexists with SC
and Fe-based AF fluctuations may well be vital to FeAs-based
superconductors, a systematic study of effects of well-defined, local
magnetic moments on this SC is lacking. Starting from optimally Co-doped
SrFe₂As₂, we can have Eu²⁺ substituting for Sr²⁺ without introducing
extra electrons and holes and assess the sensitivity of this SC to the
large J = S = 7/2 local moment.

The Eu end compound EuFe₂As₂ exists as an isostructural member of the
122 series. Therefore, a continuous substitution can be expected between
EuFe₂As₂ and AFe₂As₂. EuFe₂As₂, in addition to the AF order of the iron
sublattice at about 189 K, exhibits an A-type AF order of Eu²⁺ ions at
19 K.[22] On suppression of the AF order of iron with pressure or Co
doping,[23, 24] the onset of SC was observed, which was then followed by
a resistive re-entrance attributed to the magnetic order of Eu²⁺. Given
the sensitivity of the 122 compounds to strain and pressure,[25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30] we choose SrFe₂As₂ as host, owing to the similar size of
Sr²⁺(118 pm) and Eu²⁺ (117 pm),[31] so as to minimize the steric effects
of the doping.

To perturb the SC of the Sr 122 phase by isoelectronic substitution of
Eu and establish phase diagrams systematically using the same growth
technique for Co and Eu doping, the phase diagram of
Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ as a function of Co substitution is constructed
first. The optimal Co doping level of x ∼ 0.12 is then kept the same
across the whole range of Eu doping. We present the magnetic
susceptibility, resistivity, and heat capacity measurements on
Sr_(1 − x)Eu_(x)(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂. Superconductivity of the
optimally Co-doped SrFe₂As₂ is suppressed gradually by Eu doping
(0 ≤ y < 0.43), and crosses over a region with coexistence of SC and
Eu-based AF (0.43 ≤ y ≤ 0.60) with T_(N) increasing linearly with y. For
y ≥ 0.65, T_(N) cuts across the T_(c) line and SC suddenly disappears,
leaving just the Eu²⁺ AF-ordered state. An initial study of EuFe₂As₂
doped with both Sr and Co was recently published, but it used samples
with nominal doping values and focused on the Eu-rich side.[32] We will
compare the results of our systematic study with Ref. [32] in the
discussion section.

## II Experiment

Single-crystal samples of both Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ and
Sr_(1 − x)Eu_(x)(Fe_(0.85)Co_(0.12))₂As₂ were grown via a self-flux
method.[16, 33] The FeAs and CoAs precursors were first synthesized by
solid-state reaction. Elemental Sr and Eu were mixed with FeAs and CoAs
in the stoichiometry of 1 : 4 − 4x : 4x and 1 − y : y : 3.44 : 0.56,
respectively, in an alumina crucible and sealed into an amorphous silica
tube. The sealed ampoule was heated to 1180 degC and then cooled slowly
to 1000 degC; finally, the excess liquid flux was decanted.[33] The
as-grown crystals were annealed under a static Ar atmosphere at 500 degC
for 24 hours (as discussed below in Sec. III).[34]

Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD), with Si standard, was performed using a
Rigaku Miniflex x-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418
A). The lattice parameters were refined by hietica software.[35]
Chemical composition was determined by wavelength dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy (WDS) in a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microscope. The actual
composition of the single crystals was taken as the average of 10 spots
measured on the crystal, and the error bar was taken as the standard
deviation of the 10 values.

Magnetic susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design MPMS, SQUID
magnetometer. The in-plane ac resistivity was measured by a standard
four-probe method using an LR-700 resistance bridge with an excitation
of 60 μV on samples of typical size 3 mm × 2 mm × 0.2 mm. Electrical
contacts were made using Dupont 4929N silver paint. Heat capacity data
were collected using a Quantum Design PPMS.

All the samples were found to slowly degrade in air. Over a period of
four months, a ferromagnetic background on the order of 10⁻² emu/mol
develops, although no obvious change in appearance of the crystal and no
impurity phase in powder XRD pattern can be observed. Elemental analysis
indicates significant presence of oxygen in the surface layer of the
aged samples, implying the formation of oxides. In addition, the
superconducting transition of the aged sample broadens and T_(c)
decreases as measured by low-field magnetization. Therefore, all the
measurements reported in this paper were performed shortly after the
samples were prepared. It should be noted that, whereas the Sr-based 122
compounds are known to be susceptible to chemical changes[36] as well as
strain,[27] we observed no sample quality change over time in the
well-studied[15, 16] Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ samples.

## III Results and discussions

### Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂

The results of elemental analysis and lattice parameter determined from
the powder x-ray measurements on Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ are shown in
Fig. 1. The nearly linear dependence in Fig. 1(a), with a slope of 0.94,
indicates good agreement between the actual Co concentration x_(WDS) and
the nominal concentration x_(nominal). The compositional spread over a
wide area on the sample surface for each concentration is less than
0.02. These results demonstrate the relative homogeneity of the Co
doping in the single-crystal samples. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show the
lattice parameters a and c as well as the c/a ratio and unit-cell volume
as a function of x_(WDS). The parameters c and c/a change linearly with
x_(WDS) and the values are in good agreement with the previous
report.[17] By substitution of Co for Fe, the lattice is changed more
along the c axis than in the ab plane. The lattice parameter c decreases
by 0.6

Annealing can have a clear effect on samples and has been shown to
remove extrinsic effects associated with strain-induced defects.[34] As
shown in Fig. 2, the magnetic and structural transition of pure SrFe₂As₂
is increased from 192 K for the as-grown sample to 201 K for the
annealed sample, which is very close to the previous reported values for
polycrystalline (205 K) (Ref. [37]) and Sn flux-grown single crystalline
(198 K) (Ref. [38]) SrFe₂As₂. Based on these observations, our samples
are heat treated under the conditions described in Sec. II.

The magnetic susceptibility for H∥ab of the Sr(Fe_(1 − x) Co_(x))₂As₂
series was measured in a magnetic field of 10 kOe for x≤ 0.07 [Fig.
3(a)]. The parent compound SrFe₂As₂ manifests a sharp drop at 201 K in
magnetic susceptibility, due to the magnetic and structural
transition.[37, 38] With increasing Co doping, this transition is
suppressed to lower temperature and becomes undetectable for x > 0.07.
For 0.07 ≤x≤ 0.17, SC is induced and is manifested in low-field (H = 100
Oe), zero-field-cooled (ZFC), and field-cooled (FC) measurements below
20 K [Fig. 3(b)]. The data are compared to 1/4π to give a rough estimate
of the superconducting volume fraction. Although, as discussed in Ref.
[39], the FC curves are routinely close to zero in these materials, due
to pinning or surface barrier effects, the ZFC curves approaching −1
suggest bulk SC. The superconducting transitions remain very sharp for
x ≥ 0.07, except for x = 0.17, which becomes broad and barely visible,
consistent with a T_(c) reduced to a value close to our base
temperature. The transition temperature increases from 7.4 K for
x = 0.07, maximizes at 14.8 K for x = 0.117, and then diminishes to 5.7
K for x = 0.17.

Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity of Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂, normalized to the
room-temperature values. Similar to the case of the
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ series,[16] the magnetic and structural
transition of Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ manifests itself as a sudden drop
for x = 0, as an increase in resistivity for x = 0.042 − 0.07, and
nearly disappears for x = 0.087. After the magnetic and structural
transition is completely suppressed for x ≥ 0.092, the series shows
featureless, metallic temperature dependence. Figure 4(b) shows an
expanded view for low temperatures. At x = 0.056, a broad and incomplete
superconducting transition is observed; zero resistance is only reached
for x ≥ 0.07

curves are shown in open symbols. T_(c) is inferred from the intersect

and this agrees with the bulk SC observed in magnetic measurements.

To establish the phase diagram for the Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂ As₂ series,
the transition temperatures were inferred in the same manner as used in
Ref. [16]. T_(c) from magnetic susceptibility is determined from the
intersection of the steepest slope and the linear extrapolation of
normal magnetic susceptibility, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Resistive onset
and offset of T_(c) values are inferred from the intersects of the
steepest slope with the normal state and zero resistance, respectively,
shown in Fig. 4(b). T_(M/S) is inferred from the peak of d(M/H)/dT and
$d[\rho/\rho(300\ {\rm K})]/dT$; data for x = 0.056 is shown in Fig. 5
as an example. It is argued by Gillett _et al._[40] that only a single,
first-order-like transition occurs in the heat capacity of
Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with coincidence of magnetic and structural
transitions. Our magnetization and resistance data also do not show a
discernible splitting between T_(M) and T_(S); Fig. 5 further supports
this observation.

Based on our magnetization and electrical resistance measurements, the
phase diagram of Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ is mapped out in Fig. 6. A
superconducting dome is found: SC is first stabilized for x = 0.07 at
about 7.4 K, reaches a maximum T_(c) of ∼14.5 K for x = 0.117, then
decreases to 5.7 K for x = 0.17. Our phase diagram is in good agreement
with earlier ones. The phase diagram for polycrystalline
Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ showed a complete suppression of magnetic and
structural transition and appearance of SC at $x_{\rm nominal}=0.1$ with
the highest T_(c) of 19 K. [17] The difference between maximum T_(c) of
the polycrystalline and our single crystalline samples is probably due
to strain effect. As it has been demonstrated, [25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30]
strain can affect Sr-122 profoundly, especially when there is a high
surface area to volume fraction (as in powders). Results consistent with
our single-crystal Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ work, with highest
T_(c) ∼ 13 K, were reported by Kasinathan _et al._[41] The more recent
one based on Sn grown single crystals, having larger density of data
points, showed more clearly a coexistence of T_(M/S) and SC transition
for x = 0.07 ∼ 0.09 and the superconducting dome with optimal T_(c) of
16 K at x = 0.10. [40] The differences between our phase diagram and the
published ones, in terms of transition temperature and optimal doping
concentration, may be associated with differences in both sample
preparation and uncertainties of concentration. For our self-flux grown
samples, we can choose Co concentration x ∼ 0.12, with the highest T_(c)
and suppressed

### Sr1-yEu_(y)(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂

For our Sr1-yEu_(y)(Fe1-xCo_(x))₂As₂ series, the Co concentration was
kept at x ∼ 0.12 and the series was doped by Eu for 0 ≤ y ≤ 1. Figure
7(a) shows the elemental analysis results for the actual Eu and Co
concentrations as a function of nominal Eu concentration. The actual
concentration of Eu agrees well with the nominal, with a slope of 1.03,
and the Co concentration is essentially constant. The lattice parameters
a, c and unit-cell volume are plotted in Figs. 7(b) and 7(c). Compared
to Sr(Fe0.883Co0.117)₂As₂ [_a_ = 3.9334(2) A, c = 12.2790(2) A], the
smaller Eu2+ ion leads to a decrease in c axis by 2

The in-plane magnetic susceptibility of Sr1-yEu_(y) (Fe0.88Co12)₂As₂ is
shown in Fig. 8. Both ZFC and FC curves are measured in a magnetic field
of 100 Oe. The data clearly indicate that there are three regions of
low-temperature behavior across the series: (i) 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.34, where SC
is gradually suppressed by Eu doping but remains a simply identifiable
transition. (ii) 0.43 ≤ y ≤ 0.60, where, in this intermediate range, the
Curie-Weiss paramagnetic background due to Eu2+ moments gradually
becomes large enough to shift the diamagnetic signal to positive values.
In addition, a second feature appears and, as y increases, it rises in
temperature leading to a double-peak feature, which can be ascribed to
the coexistence of SC and lower temperature AF associated with the Eu2+
sublattice. The upper transition shows a splitting between ZFC and FC
curves consistent with SC. The lower transition of AF origin is present
on both ZFC and FC curves at the same temperature, indicated by arrows.
These transitions are further confirmed by heat capacity measurement as
shown below. (iii) 0.65 ≤ y ≤ 1, where clear AF transitions manifest as
cusps and T_(N) continues to increase with Eu2+ doping up to 17 K for
y = 1. It is worth noting that FC and ZFC curves collapse on each other
for these higher y values, suggesting long-range antiferromagnetic
order, similar to EuFe2As2,[42] instead of other magnetic origins, e.g.,
spin glass or ferrimagnetic order.

Figure 9(a) shows M(T)/H as a function of temperature data measured in
various fields for y = 1. The cusp initially shifts to lower temperature
with higher field and then becomes saturated paramagneticlike for fields
above 4 kOe. Neutron scattering experiments on pure EuFe2As₂ revealed
that the long-range order of Eu2+ is of _A_-type AF, namely, the Eu2+
moments are parallel in the _ab_ plane and antiparallel along the c axis
with an ordering wave vector of k = (0, 0, 1).[45] Therefore, the
metamagnetic transition for y = 1 is most likely due to the spin flip
along the field direction between Eu2+ layers, similar to EuFe2As2.[44]
Our results are in good agreement with the reported magnetic field
dependence of M/H for EuFe1.715Co0.285As₂, where metamagnetic transition
occurs at a lower field of 3.5 kOe than that of pure EuFe2As₂ (8.5
kOe).[44] Because of this metamagnetic transition, the series for
y ≥ 0.43 all show similar field dependence [Fig. 9(b)], i.e., the slope
of magnetization changes around 4 kOe and shows a saturation moment of
∼7μ_(B)/Eu2+ in the high field. For y = 0.43 and 0.50, diamagnetic
contribution of SC can be seen below 500 Oe. Given the metamagnetic
transition, the AF transition temperature T_(N) was inferred from the
cusp of d(χT)/dT measured in H = 100 Oe.[45]

In Fig. 9(c), we examine the high-temperature behavior of the magnetic
susceptibility. Since the Hund’s rule ground state for Eu2+ is the same
as Gd3+ (^(7/2)S), there is no spin-orbital coupling and, thus, the
crystal field effect is absent and well-defined magnetic moments of Eu2+
exhibiting Curie-Weiss law at high temperatures are expected. We are
able to estimate the concentration of Eu2+ from magnetic measurements by
assuming each Eu2+ carries an effective magnetic moment of 7.94 μ_(B).
The magnetic background of Sr(Fe0.883Co0.117)₂As₂ in a magnetic field of
10 kOe is subtracted from all the datasets, and the inverse magnetic
susceptibility normalized to a fitted Eu concentration y_(M) is plotted
in Fig. 9(c) as a function of

symbols denote FC data. Arrows indicate the AF transitions, which are
consistent for both ZFC and FC curves.

temperature. The magnetic susceptibility above 100 K is fitted by the
Curie-Weiss law:

$$\chi(T)=\frac{y_{M}N\mu(Eu^{2+})^{2}}{3k_{\rm B}(T-\theta_{\rm CW})}=\frac{7.94^{2 }y_{M}}{8(T-\theta_{\rm CW})}\ ({\rm emu}/{\rm mol}),$$

where N is the Avogadro constant, $k_{\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant,
and $\theta_{\rm CW}$ is Curie-Weiss temperature. As can be seen in
Table 1, $y_{\rm VDS}$ and y_(M) agree well with each other and follow
the same trend with the nominal concentration. The positive Curie-Weiss
temperature is consistent with an overall predisposition to
ferromagnetic coupling between Eu²⁺ moments, at least in the magnetic
field of 10 kOe.

The low-temperature (T < 20 K) heat capacity divided by temperature
C_(p)/T versus T of Sr_(1 − y)Eu_(y)(Fe_(0.88)Co_(0.12))₂As₂ is
presented in Fig. 10(a). A very pronounced discontinuity can be seen for
0.43 ≤ y ≤ 1. The transition temperature T_(N), defined by this
discontinuity, decreases with decreasing Eu²⁺ concentration and is in
excellent agreement with the cusp of d(χT)/dT of magnetic
susceptibility. These data confirm that AF is the lower transition in
the intermediate range 0.43 ≤ y ≤ 0.60. For the y = 0.34 data, this
discontinuity appears to be at or just below our base temperature of 2.0
K. For y < 0.34, the complete transition can not be detected. It is

$y_{\rm VDS}$.

worth noting that the low-temperature C_(p)/T below 5 K for 0.65 ≤ y ≤ 1
shows a linear dependence on T, i.e., C ∝ T². This temperature
dependence of heat capacity is consistent with the low-temperature AF
magnon excitations of a two-dimensional magnetic lattice.[46]

Figure 10(b) shows that, starting from the low y side, SC can be
identified as a weak jump for 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.19, but becomes hard to detect
for y > 0.34 because of the large background associated with the AF
transition. Figure 10(b) inset shows a representative heat capacity jump
for y = 0. The SC transition temperature T_(c) is inferred by isentropic
construction, i.e., the two shaded areas have the same size. For
y = 0.34, T_(c) is taken as the middle point of the jump.

Figure 11 shows the temperature dependence of the normalized resistivity
of Sr_(1 − y)Eu_(y)(Fe_(0.88)Co₁₂)₂As₂. Given the Co-doping level (near
optimal), it is not surprising that the series remains metallic and
featureless above 20 K. In Fig. 11(b), it can be seen that the
superconducting transition temperature is gradually lowered by Eu²⁺
doping for 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.60. The transition becomes broader for y > 0.19,
e.g., ΔT is 4 K for y = 0 and 6 K for y = 0.5. This wide transition is
similarly observed in Ni-doped SrFe₂As₂.[34] For y = 0.65 and 0.72, a
resistivity re-entrance is observed as a broad peak below a local
minimum in resistivity at 7.8 and 9.8 K, respectively. The minimum
coincides with the AF order temperature measured by magnetic
susceptibility and heat capacity, indicating that the bulk SC transition
is interrupted by AF order. Such incomplete resistive transitions have
been observed in Sr_(0.3)Eu_(0.7)(Fe_(0.86)Co_(0.14))₂As₂ and EuFe₂As₂
under pressure.[32, 23]

The superconducting transition temperature T_(c) is inferred in the same
way as in Fig. 4. For y = 0.65 and 0.72, only T_(c)^(onset) is
extracted. For 0.85 ≤ y ≤ 1 [Fig. 11(c)], the series remains a normal
metal and manifests a very small change in slope at T_(N) (corresponding
to the peak in $d[\rho/\rho(300\ {\rm K})]/dT$), due to the loss of spin
disorder scattering. We must note that the change in resistivity at
T_(N) is very small, even smaller than that of EuFe₂As₂.[42] This
implies very weak coupling between Eu²⁺ moments and conduction
electrons. Recent detailed transport studies of EuFe₂As₂ under high
pressure showed that electron scattering due to Eu²⁺ has minor
contribution to both resistivity and Hall effect, thus consistent with
our conclusion.[47]

### Analysis and discussion

Based on the transport and thermodynamic measurements, a phase diagram
as a function of Eu doping can be constructed and is shown in Fig. 12.
Starting from the Eu-rich side of the phase diagram, we can see that
T_(N) decreases with decreasing Eu content and crosses through the T_(c)
line, near y ∼ 0.60, without any resolvable change in slope (dT_(N)/dy).
This is fairly standard behavior for an intermetallic compound with a
local moment antiferromagnetic phase transition that is being reduced
via site dilution with a nonmagnetic ion (i.e., Sr²⁺ for Eu²⁺).[11, 48]
Starting from the Sr-rich side of the phase diagram, we can see that,
when Eu²⁺ is a paramagnetic

impurity, it suppresses SC monotonically but rather weakly. The weakness
of the paramagnetic Eu²⁺ as a pair breaker is not unexpected, given the
rather weak coupling of the Eu²⁺ moments to the conduction electrons, as
most clearly manifested by the small loss of spin-disorder scattering
seen in Fig. 11(c). The suppression of T_(c) by magnetic impurities in a
nonmagnetic superconductor has been discussed by Abrikosov and Gor’kov
[1]. The fit to AG theory for data 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.34 gives a critical
concentration y_(c) = 1.08, implying SC could survive in
Eu(Fe_(0.88)Co_(0.12))₂As₂ if the Eu²⁺ sublattice were to remain in the
disordered paramagnetic state (_which it does not_). For
0.43 ≤ y ≤ 0.60, both SC and AF states are clearly detected. As long as
T_(c) > T_(N), the advent of AF order does not lead to any re-entrance
or other clear features in the T − y_(WDS) phase diagram. This is in
agreement with early findings that EuFe₂As₂ becomes a bulk
superconductor with T_(c) ∼ 30 K and SC coexists with AFM order with
T_(N) ∼ 20 K [49]. The remarkable feature revealed in Fig. 12 is the
sudden disappearance of bulk SC when the T_(N) line intercepts the T_(c)
line. Superconductivity, as defined by a ρ = 0 state, suddenly
disappears for y ≥ 0.65. This sudden truncation of the superconducting
region is quite remarkable and demands further analysis.

As has been shown in this work and discussed before [27, 34], the
resistivity data associated with pure and doped SrFe₂As₂ samples is
complicated, manifesting superconducting transition temperatures that
appear to be higher than those determined by bulk, thermodynamic
measurements such as magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. On the
other hand, in both Figs. 6 and 12, the superconducting transition
inferred from resistivity roughly tracks those inferred from
magnetization and specific heat (in Fig. 12, even the T_(c) data
inferred from the onset criterion drop by a similar amount as the T_(c)
values inferred from thermodynamic data, just with an offset by a few
degrees). This is consistent with the idea that a small portion of the
sample has an enhanced T_(c) associated with some strain and damage.
Similar differences of T_(c) between that inferred from resistivity and
magnetic susceptibility, as well as transition width ΔT_(c), were
observed in Fig. 6 and in Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Ni_(x))₂As₂[34]. This being said,
the absence of any hint of superconducting drop in the y > 0.72 data
[Fig. 11(c)] is a conclusive evidence that there is not even trace
superconductivity in these samples. For the y = 0.65 and 0.72 samples,
there appears to be an onset of filamentary superconductivity that is
interrupted by the bulk AF.

In comparison to Ref. [32], whereas the above discussion and data show
that AF appears to be very detrimental to the formation of the
superconducting state when T_(N) > T_(c), there is no evidence of the AF
leading to dramatic re-entrance of the normal state when T_(N) < T_(c)
(i.e., for y ≤ 0.60). The resistivity data as well as the susceptibility
data do not show any feature that can be associated with the
re-establishment of the normal state below the T_(N) line as it cuts
under the superconducting state.

These observations have several implications and also suggest several
directions for future research. First, although dilute, paramagnetic,
Eu²⁺ only weakly suppresses SC, and antiferromagnetically ordered Eu²⁺
appears to prevent its formation. As has been the case for other
magnetic superconductors, specifically the RNi₂B₂C materials [11], a
dramatic difference in the effects of local moments on SC can be
observed when comparing disordered, single ions in paramagnetic state
and an antiferromagnetically ordered sublattice. In the case of
(Ho_(1 − x)Dy_(x))Ni₂B₂C [11, 50], as T_(c) crosses from above T_(N) to
below it, the cause of pair breaking changes from spin-flip scattering
off of single impurities to interactions with magnetic excitations of
the order state. In the case of
Sr_(1 − y)Eu_(y)(Fe_(0.88)Co_(0.12))₂As₂, the sudden loss of
superconductivity as T_(N) rises above T_(c) implies that somehow
long-range antiferromagnetic order of the Eu sublattice strongly
suppresses (or removes) necessary ingredients for the establishment of
the superconducting state. If antiferromagnetic fluctuations of the Fe
sublattice [associated with the k = (1, 0, 1) ordering [51]] are
associated with the pairing in the superconducting state, then
long-range order of the large (J = S = 7/2) Eu sublattice with an
ordering wave vector of k = (1, 0, 0) could easily be related to a
dramatic change in the Fe sublattice fluctuation spectrum. Such a
dramatic change in the fluctuations could easily be the suppressed,
missing ingredient for superconductivity invoked above. So, unlike
DyNi₂B₂C, which apparently requires antiferromagnetic ordering of the Dy
sublattice to suppress pair breaking of the individual Dy moments [11],
Sr_(1 − y)Eu_(y)(Fe_(0.88)Co_(0.12))₂As₂ requires the Eu sublattice to
remain in the disordered, paramagnetic state in order to establish the
FeAs-based superconducting state.

Although this hypothesis readily explains the sudden loss of SC when
T_(N) > T_(c), it also would imply that the SC state below T_(N), when
T_(N) < T_(c), should be modified; although Figs. 8, 11, and 12 show
that there is no effect of T_(N) on the low-field magnetization and
zero-field resistivity when T_(N) < T_(c), it is reasonable to
anticipate that there will be changes in other superconducting
parameters such as the superfluid density and penetration depth.

## IV Conclusions

Transport and thermodynamic measurements were performed on
Sr(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ and Sr_(1 − y)Eu_(y)(Fe_(0.88)Co_(0.12))₂As₂
single crystals. A superconducting dome is identified in Sr(Fe_(1 − x)
Co_(x))₂As₂ as a function of Co doping and the optimal Co concentration
is determined to be x ∼ 0.12. The SC of the optimal Co doping is
gradually suppressed by paramagnetic Eu²⁺ following AG theory and found
to coexist with AF of Eu²⁺ for 0.43 ≤ y ≤ 0.60. For higher Eu²⁺ doping,
bulk SC disappears suddenly when T_(N) > T_(c). We speculate that the
long-range order of the Eu²⁺ sublattice is coupled to the AF
fluctuations of the Fe sublattice and the suppression of the Fe
fluctuations required for FeAs-based SC is what gives rise to the abrupt
loss of bulk SC when T_(N) surpasses T_(c).
