###### Abstract

We have investigated the electronic properties of Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} (0.5\,x\,\approx\,0.51,0\,\approx\,y\,\approx\,0.22) single crystals with a special focus on the carrier compensated regions (x=2y). With increasing x and y under the x=2y constraint, the ground state changes from an antiferromagnetic metal to a paramagnetic metal with an intervening superconducting phase. On the basis of the Hall coefficient measurements, we show that this transition occurs in a coherent alloy with a Fermi surface similar to BaFe_{2}As_{2}, and that the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are slightly weakened with increasing degree of alloying. We discuss the role of the randomness introduced by the substitution of Co^{2+} on this transition.

## I Introduction

There is growing evidence that superconductivity and static antiferromagnetic order compete with each other in Fe-based superconductors (SCs). [1, 2] This is in marked contrast with dynamical antiferromagnetic fluctuations which have been theoretically proposed to mediate Cooper pairs with s_{\pm} symmetry. [3, 4] The question of how to destabilize the static antiferromagnetic order while retaining the low-energy antiferromagnetic fluctuations is the key to raise the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}).

Among the families of Fe-based superconductors, the most well-studied family is the so-called 1-2-2 system with the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure. [5] The parent compound BaFe_{2}As_{2} has hole and electron Fermi surfaces with identical areas, which is a characteristic of a compensated metal. [6] This compound undergoes an antiferromagnetic phase transition at \sim\,140 \,K, where the crystal structure changes from high-temperature tetragonal I4/mmm into low-temperature orthorhombic Fmmm. [7] Although the band nesting is considered to be a key driving factor of the transition, there still remains a controversy over the role of electron correlation effect and the orbital degrees of freedom. [6, 8] Superconductivity occurs when the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed and this can be achieved in various ways. One efficient method is by carrier doping, which weakens the nesting condition by enlarging one type of Fermi surface. Hole doping of the Fe sheets through substitution of K^{+} ions for Ba^{2+} ions induces superconductivity with T_{c} as high as 38 \,K. [9] Electron doping achieved by the substitution of Co^{2+} ions for Fe^{2+} ions also gives rise to superconductivity with T_{c}\,\sim\,25 \,K. [10, 11] Here, it should be underlined that Co^{2+} ions not only modify the Fermi surface [12] but also introduce the carrier scatterers into the system.

Three methods of suppressing the antiferromagnetic order while maintaining the compensated metallic state are available. First, application of hydrostatic pressure to BaFe_{2}As_{2} leads to a transition to bulk superconductivity with T_{c} =18 \,K at 11 GPa. [13] This is interpreted as preferential lattice shrinking parallel to the crystal layers, leading to a more three-dimensional Fermi surface with weaker nesting character, thus favoring superconductivity. Second, the partial substitution of As atoms with P atoms in BaFe_{2}As_{2} induces superconductivity at 31 \,K. [14, 15] Since P substitution renders the Fermi surfaces more three dimensional, this can be regarded as the application of chemical pressure. Third, isovalent substitution of the type Ba(Fe_{1-y}Ru_{y})_{2}As_{2} leads to superconductivity with a maximum T_{c} of 20 \,K. [16] The formation of coherent alloys and the reduced Stoner factor in comparison with BaFe_{2}As_{2} due to the extended nature of the Ru 4d orbitals have been shown by first-principles calculations. [17] These features have been confirmed by subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. [18]

Singh proposed the possibility of superconductivity in another compensated metal KFeCoAs_{2}. [19] On the basis of band calculations, he pointed out that the Fermi surfaces of KFeCoAs_{2} resemble those of BaFe_{2}As_{2} but have a weaker tendency toward the magnetic order. The resemblance is considered to be much more striking in comparison with BaFe_{2}As_{2} substituted by P and Ru atoms with a different chemical trend. Hence, it is not a trivial question to ask whether superconductivity instead of antiferromagnetic order is actually realized in KFeCoAs_{2}. Motivated by this theoretical work, we report on the electronic phase diagram of the solid solution Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2}, as summarized in Fig. 1. This system is unique in the sense that the hole doping by the K^{+} substitution and the electron doping by the Co^{2+} substitution are combined. The system thus includes a region where doped holes and electrons are compensated (x=2y); the special case is KFeCoAs_{2} at x=1 and y=1/2. We demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic metallic phase is destabilized and the superconducting phase appears with increasing degree of alloying on the x=2y line. We then discuss which material parameters trigger this transition.

## II Experimental

Single crystals of Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} were synthesized using the flux method. The starting materials Ba, K, FeAs, and CoAs were placed in an alumina crucible. This was then sealed in a double quartz tube under 0.3 atmosphere of Ar. The tube was heated at 1273 K for 2 h, slowly cooled  to 1073 K for 24 h, and then quenched to room temperature. The size of the crystal obtained is typically 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.1 mm^{3}. The chemical composition x and y were determined by an energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer equipped with a scanning electron microscope. The x-ray diffraction pattern for the powdered crystals at room temperature are well described by the space group I4/_mmm_. The lattice parameter a decreases with increasing x and y, and c increases (decreases) with increasing x (_y_); these trends are the same as in Ba1-xK,Fe2As2 and Ba(Fe1-y,Co_y_2)As2.[9, 21] The magnetic properties were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. The electrical resistivity (_r_) and Hall resistivity (_r_H) in the _a-b_ plane were measured by using a physical properties measurement system (Quantum Design). When measuring _r_H, we rotated the sample in the magnetic field of 7 T at a fixed temperature (_T_). Although the sample thickness could be measured accurately, the error bar for the distance between the voltage electrodes was rather large. Therefore, we do not discuss the absolute value of r in this study.

## III Results

Figure 2 shows the T dependence of the in-plane resistivity scaled by the 250 K value _r_/_r_(250 K) for Ba1-xKx(Fe1-yCo_y_2)As2. The composition range covers 0 \leq x\leq 0.51 and 0 \leq y\leq 0.22, and we cannot obtain KFeCoAs2 in a single-crystal form. The data for the hole-rich region (_x_ > 2_y_), the hole-electron compensated region (_x_ ~ 2_y_), and the electron-rich region (_x_ < 2_y_) are separately presented in Figs. 2(a)-2(c), respectively. With decreasing T, the value of r of BaFe2As2 shows a sharp decrease at 136 K, where the magnetic and structural transitions occur simultaneously. Upon substitution, the anomaly in r changes to an upturn with an internal structure corresponding to the separated structural transition temperature (_T_s) and antiferromagnetic transition temperature (_T_N). Following the methodology of earlier reports on Ba(Fe1-y,Co_y_2)As2,[11, 17] these values are estimated to be T_{s} = 131 K and T_{N} = 114 K for (_x_,_y_) = (0.09,0.04), and T_{s} = 107 K and T_{N} = 87 K for (_x_,_y_) = (0.16,0.06). The value of r over a broad composition range

  drops to zero at low T, indicating the onset of superconductivity. This superconductivity is a bulk property, as evidenced by the Messiner signal shown in Fig. 3. The volume fraction exceeds 100%; this originates from experimental errors in measuring the mass of a small single crystal. T_{c} is estimated from the midpoint of the resistivity drop, and the transition width is typically 2 K. At (x,y)=(0.44,0.22), \rho shows a decrease below \sim10 K but does not reach zero. We conclude that the superconductivity is filamentary and the bulk material is in the paramagnetic state. The ground-state properties obtained as above, as well as those reported for Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} are summarized as an electronic phase diagram in Fig. 1.

\rho in the paramagnetic state exhibits characteristic T variations depending on the type of the dominant carrier. For hole dominant compositions [Fig. 2(a)], \rho shows a strong upward-concave T dependence over a wide T range, being reminiscent of the Bloch-Gruneisen formula caused by phonon scattering. At (x,y)=(0.32,0.02), (0.31,\,0.09), and (0.34,\,0.11), the upward-concave behavior is taken over by the downward-concave one below 80-90 K whereas it persists down to T_{c} in (x,y)=(0.49,0.12), and (0.51,\,0.16). On the other hand, \rho in the electron dominant composition range [Fig. 2(c)] shows a downward-concave T dependence over the whole T range measured, as is frequently observed in the correlated electron systems. It should be noted that this feature is also seen in the other electron doped 1-2-2 compounds Ba(Fe_{1-y}_{y})_{2}As_{2} (M=Co, Ni, Rh, Pd, and Pt).[22, 23, 24, 25] This type of particle-hole asymmetric charge dynamics has been discussed in an earlier study of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2}, in which the resistivity of the hole and electron bands (\rho_{h} and \rho_{e}) were shown to display upward- and downward-concave T dependence, respectively.[16] Our results are in harmony with this conclusion: \rho is written as \rho=1/(\sigma_{h}+\sigma_{e}) with \sigma_{h} =1/\rho_{h} and \sigma_{e}=1/\rho_{e} in the two carrier model, and the \sigma_{h}- and \sigma_{e}-term becomes dominant in the hole- and electron-rich composition regions, respectively. However, the microscopic mechanism of the distinct T dependence between \rho_{h} and \rho_{e} is still unclear.

Figure 4 plots \rho(0\

 in excellent agreement with the values of T_{\rm N} estimated from \rho. In the paramagnetic state, R_{\rm H} gradually increases in magnitude with decreasing T except at (x,y) = (0.16, 0.06); this T variation originates from the antiferromagnetic fluctuations.[15, 23] With departure from x = y = 0, the T variation becomes slightly weaker, inferring that the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are weakened even in the similar Fermi surfaces of BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The reason why R_{\rm H} for (x,y) = (0.16, 0.06) shows a nonmonotonic T dependence is probably due to the deviation of the composition from the x = 2y line.

## IV Discussion

We now discuss the mechanism of the antiferromagnetic metal-superconductor transition on the x = 2y line. The reduction in antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the paramagnetic state and subsequent destabilization of antiferromagnetic order upon K^{+} and Co^{2+} substitution is qualitatively consistent with the results of the first-principles calculations for KFeCoAs_{2}.[19] In the theory, the reason for the weaker magnetic instability is attributed to the reduction in the density of states (Stoner factor) due to the shorter a. The lattice parameters for the parent compound (x = y = 0) and the superconducting sample with (x,y) = (0.30, 0.14) are a = 3.952 A and c = 13.01 A, and a = 3.913 A and c = 13.12 A, respectively. It is not clear whether this small in-plane contraction (\sim1.0%) gives rise to the reduction in the density of states which is enough to destabilize the static magnetic order. In this case, we notice that the pressure effect hardly explains the appearance of superconductivity since lattice shrinkage is \sim 1.0%, being much smaller than \sim10% shrinkage of BaFe_{2}As_{2} under a pressure of 11 GPa.[28]

Besides the chemical pressure effect, we need to seriously consider the randomness in the alloys.[17] The antiferromagnetic alignment due to the band nesting is supposed to be destroyed by the disorder effect since it generally smoothens the singular structure of the band dispersion. Moreover, it is clarified that an orbital polarized Fermi surface is formed following the concomitant magnetic and structural transition in BaFe_{2}As_{2};[6] the addition of Co^{2+} ions with one excess electron among the 3d manifold likely destabilizes the spin/orbital ordered state. Hence, it is probable that the site disorder introduced by the Co^{2+} substitution is the key parameter in the antiferromagnetic metal-superconductor transition. It is unclear which of the two mechanisms--the lattice parameter change and the disorder effect--is actually more responsible. Nevertheless, we propose that the introduction of randomness is the effective phase control method for situations when superconductivity and antiferromagnetism are competing in a bicritical manner.[29] In order to establish this conclusion, further experiments are expected to be performed in the future.

We next discuss how the superconducting phase is overtaken by the paramagnetic metallic phase at (x,y) = (0.44, 0.22). At this composition, R_{\rm H} still shows a T variation, indicative of the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2}, where the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are largely smeared out when the superconductivity disappears.[30, 31] This contrasting behavior is likely to be related to the differences in the Fermi surface. In Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2}, most of the hole Fermi surfaces disappear in the vicinity of the superconductor-paramagnetic metal transition[12] whereas there are hole and electron Fermi surfaces with a nesting character in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} with x = 2y. Hence, we speculate that the superconductivity is not destroyed by the weakened antiferromagnetic fluctuations as a glue of Cooper pairs in the present system. A more plausible scenario is a pair-breaking effect due to the Co^{2+} ions,[32] which enter into the conducting Fe sheets. From our results, we estimate the critical Co^{2+} concentration to be y_{c} = 0.17-0.22.[33] This value is much smaller than the percolation threshold of impurities on the nearest-neighbor square lattice model 0.41.[19, 34] The pair breaking effect induced by the disorder is also relevant to the T_{c} decrease. Indeed, as can be seen from Fig. 1, T_{c} has a tendency to decrease with increasing y. Since various factors relevant to T_{c} such as the lattice constant (pnictoen height) and Fermi-surface shape also varies in the x-y plane, quantitative arguments on T_{c} are fairly difficult.

## V Conclusions

We report on the resistivity and Hall coefficient for single crystal Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} (0 \leq x \leq 0.51, 0 \leq y \leq 0.22). We found a transition from the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase via a superconducting phase on the x = 2y line. The static antiferromagnetic order is destabilized by the combined effect of the in-plane lattice contraction and the site disorder introduced by the Co^{2+} substitution. The superconducting phase is replaced by a paramagnetic phase owing to the pair-breaking effect of the substituted Co^{2+} ions.

###### Abstract

We have investigated the electronic properties of Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} (0.5\,x\,\approx\,0.51,0\,\approx\,y\,\approx\,0.22) single crystals with a special focus on the carrier compensated regions (x=2y). With increasing x and y under the x=2y constraint, the ground state changes from an antiferromagnetic metal to a paramagnetic metal with an intervening superconducting phase. On the basis of the Hall coefficient measurements, we show that this transition occurs in a coherent alloy with a Fermi surface similar to BaFe_{2}As_{2}, and that the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are slightly weakened with increasing degree of alloying. We discuss the role of the randomness introduced by the substitution of Co^{2+} on this transition.

## I Introduction

There is growing evidence that superconductivity and static antiferromagnetic order compete with each other in Fe-based superconductors (SCs). [1, 2] This is in marked contrast with dynamical antiferromagnetic fluctuations which have been theoretically proposed to mediate Cooper pairs with s_{\pm} symmetry. [3, 4] The question of how to destabilize the static antiferromagnetic order while retaining the low-energy antiferromagnetic fluctuations is the key to raise the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}).

Among the families of Fe-based superconductors, the most well-studied family is the so-called 1-2-2 system with the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure. [5] The parent compound BaFe_{2}As_{2} has hole and electron Fermi surfaces with identical areas, which is a characteristic of a compensated metal. [6] This compound undergoes an antiferromagnetic phase transition at \sim\,140 \,K, where the crystal structure changes from high-temperature tetragonal I4/mmm into low-temperature orthorhombic Fmmm. [7] Although the band nesting is considered to be a key driving factor of the transition, there still remains a controversy over the role of electron correlation effect and the orbital degrees of freedom. [6, 8] Superconductivity occurs when the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed and this can be achieved in various ways. One efficient method is by carrier doping, which weakens the nesting condition by enlarging one type of Fermi surface. Hole doping of the Fe sheets through substitution of K^{+} ions for Ba^{2+} ions induces superconductivity with T_{c} as high as 38 \,K. [9] Electron doping achieved by the substitution of Co^{2+} ions for Fe^{2+} ions also gives rise to superconductivity with T_{c}\,\sim\,25 \,K. [10, 11] Here, it should be underlined that Co^{2+} ions not only modify the Fermi surface [12] but also introduce the carrier scatterers into the system.

Three methods of suppressing the antiferromagnetic order while maintaining the compensated metallic state are available. First, application of hydrostatic pressure to BaFe_{2}As_{2} leads to a transition to bulk superconductivity with T_{c} =18 \,K at 11 GPa. [13] This is interpreted as preferential lattice shrinking parallel to the crystal layers, leading to a more three-dimensional Fermi surface with weaker nesting character, thus favoring superconductivity. Second, the partial substitution of As atoms with P atoms in BaFe_{2}As_{2} induces superconductivity at 31 \,K. [14, 15] Since P substitution renders the Fermi surfaces more three dimensional, this can be regarded as the application of chemical pressure. Third, isovalent substitution of the type Ba(Fe_{1-y}Ru_{y})_{2}As_{2} leads to superconductivity with a maximum T_{c} of 20 \,K. [16] The formation of coherent alloys and the reduced Stoner factor in comparison with BaFe_{2}As_{2} due to the extended nature of the Ru 4d orbitals have been shown by first-principles calculations. [17] These features have been confirmed by subsequent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. [18]

Singh proposed the possibility of superconductivity in another compensated metal KFeCoAs_{2}. [19] On the basis of band calculations, he pointed out that the Fermi surfaces of KFeCoAs_{2} resemble those of BaFe_{2}As_{2} but have a weaker tendency toward the magnetic order. The resemblance is considered to be much more striking in comparison with BaFe_{2}As_{2} substituted by P and Ru atoms with a different chemical trend. Hence, it is not a trivial question to ask whether superconductivity instead of antiferromagnetic order is actually realized in KFeCoAs_{2}. Motivated by this theoretical work, we report on the electronic phase diagram of the solid solution Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2}, as summarized in Fig. 1. This system is unique in the sense that the hole doping by the K^{+} substitution and the electron doping by the Co^{2+} substitution are combined. The system thus includes a region where doped holes and electrons are compensated (x=2y); the special case is KFeCoAs_{2} at x=1 and y=1/2. We demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic metallic phase is destabilized and the superconducting phase appears with increasing degree of alloying on the x=2y line. We then discuss which material parameters trigger this transition.

## II Experimental

Single crystals of Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} were synthesized using the flux method. The starting materials Ba, K, FeAs, and CoAs were placed in an alumina crucible. This was then sealed in a double quartz tube under 0.3 atmosphere of Ar. The tube was heated at 1273 K for 2 h, slowly cooled  to 1073 K for 24 h, and then quenched to room temperature. The size of the crystal obtained is typically 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.1 mm^{3}. The chemical composition x and y were determined by an energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer equipped with a scanning electron microscope. The x-ray diffraction pattern for the powdered crystals at room temperature are well described by the space group I4/_mmm_. The lattice parameter a decreases with increasing x and y, and c increases (decreases) with increasing x (_y_); these trends are the same as in Ba1-xK,Fe2As2 and Ba(Fe1-y,Co_y_2)As2.[9, 21] The magnetic properties were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. The electrical resistivity (_r_) and Hall resistivity (_r_H) in the _a-b_ plane were measured by using a physical properties measurement system (Quantum Design). When measuring _r_H, we rotated the sample in the magnetic field of 7 T at a fixed temperature (_T_). Although the sample thickness could be measured accurately, the error bar for the distance between the voltage electrodes was rather large. Therefore, we do not discuss the absolute value of r in this study.

## III Results

Figure 2 shows the T dependence of the in-plane resistivity scaled by the 250 K value _r_/_r_(250 K) for Ba1-xKx(Fe1-yCo_y_2)As2. The composition range covers 0 \leq x\leq 0.51 and 0 \leq y\leq 0.22, and we cannot obtain KFeCoAs2 in a single-crystal form. The data for the hole-rich region (_x_ > 2_y_), the hole-electron compensated region (_x_ ~ 2_y_), and the electron-rich region (_x_ < 2_y_) are separately presented in Figs. 2(a)-2(c), respectively. With decreasing T, the value of r of BaFe2As2 shows a sharp decrease at 136 K, where the magnetic and structural transitions occur simultaneously. Upon substitution, the anomaly in r changes to an upturn with an internal structure corresponding to the separated structural transition temperature (_T_s) and antiferromagnetic transition temperature (_T_N). Following the methodology of earlier reports on Ba(Fe1-y,Co_y_2)As2,[11, 17] these values are estimated to be T_{s} = 131 K and T_{N} = 114 K for (_x_,_y_) = (0.09,0.04), and T_{s} = 107 K and T_{N} = 87 K for (_x_,_y_) = (0.16,0.06). The value of r over a broad composition range

  drops to zero at low T, indicating the onset of superconductivity. This superconductivity is a bulk property, as evidenced by the Messiner signal shown in Fig. 3. The volume fraction exceeds 100%; this originates from experimental errors in measuring the mass of a small single crystal. T_{c} is estimated from the midpoint of the resistivity drop, and the transition width is typically 2 K. At (x,y)=(0.44,0.22), \rho shows a decrease below \sim10 K but does not reach zero. We conclude that the superconductivity is filamentary and the bulk material is in the paramagnetic state. The ground-state properties obtained as above, as well as those reported for Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} are summarized as an electronic phase diagram in Fig. 1.

\rho in the paramagnetic state exhibits characteristic T variations depending on the type of the dominant carrier. For hole dominant compositions [Fig. 2(a)], \rho shows a strong upward-concave T dependence over a wide T range, being reminiscent of the Bloch-Gruneisen formula caused by phonon scattering. At (x,y)=(0.32,0.02), (0.31,\,0.09), and (0.34,\,0.11), the upward-concave behavior is taken over by the downward-concave one below 80-90 K whereas it persists down to T_{c} in (x,y)=(0.49,0.12), and (0.51,\,0.16). On the other hand, \rho in the electron dominant composition range [Fig. 2(c)] shows a downward-concave T dependence over the whole T range measured, as is frequently observed in the correlated electron systems. It should be noted that this feature is also seen in the other electron doped 1-2-2 compounds Ba(Fe_{1-y}_{y})_{2}As_{2} (M=Co, Ni, Rh, Pd, and Pt).[22, 23, 24, 25] This type of particle-hole asymmetric charge dynamics has been discussed in an earlier study of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2}, in which the resistivity of the hole and electron bands (\rho_{h} and \rho_{e}) were shown to display upward- and downward-concave T dependence, respectively.[16] Our results are in harmony with this conclusion: \rho is written as \rho=1/(\sigma_{h}+\sigma_{e}) with \sigma_{h} =1/\rho_{h} and \sigma_{e}=1/\rho_{e} in the two carrier model, and the \sigma_{h}- and \sigma_{e}-term becomes dominant in the hole- and electron-rich composition regions, respectively. However, the microscopic mechanism of the distinct T dependence between \rho_{h} and \rho_{e} is still unclear.

 in excellent agreement with the values of T_{\rm N} estimated from \rho. In the paramagnetic state, R_{\rm H} gradually increases in magnitude with decreasing T except at (x,y) = (0.16, 0.06); this T variation originates from the antiferromagnetic fluctuations.[15, 23] With departure from x = y = 0, the T variation becomes slightly weaker, inferring that the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are weakened even in the similar Fermi surfaces of BaFe_{2}As_{2}. The reason why R_{\rm H} for (x,y) = (0.16, 0.06) shows a nonmonotonic T dependence is probably due to the deviation of the composition from the x = 2y line.

## IV Discussion

We now discuss the mechanism of the antiferromagnetic metal-superconductor transition on the x = 2y line. The reduction in antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the paramagnetic state and subsequent destabilization of antiferromagnetic order upon K^{+} and Co^{2+} substitution is qualitatively consistent with the results of the first-principles calculations for KFeCoAs_{2}.[19] In the theory, the reason for the weaker magnetic instability is attributed to the reduction in the density of states (Stoner factor) due to the shorter a. The lattice parameters for the parent compound (x = y = 0) and the superconducting sample with (x,y) = (0.30, 0.14) are a = 3.952 A and c = 13.01 A, and a = 3.913 A and c = 13.12 A, respectively. It is not clear whether this small in-plane contraction (\sim1.0%) gives rise to the reduction in the density of states which is enough to destabilize the static magnetic order. In this case, we notice that the pressure effect hardly explains the appearance of superconductivity since lattice shrinkage is \sim 1.0%, being much smaller than \sim10% shrinkage of BaFe_{2}As_{2} under a pressure of 11 GPa.[28]

Besides the chemical pressure effect, we need to seriously consider the randomness in the alloys.[17] The antiferromagnetic alignment due to the band nesting is supposed to be destroyed by the disorder effect since it generally smoothens the singular structure of the band dispersion. Moreover, it is clarified that an orbital polarized Fermi surface is formed following the concomitant magnetic and structural transition in BaFe_{2}As_{2};[6] the addition of Co^{2+} ions with one excess electron among the 3d manifold likely destabilizes the spin/orbital ordered state. Hence, it is probable that the site disorder introduced by the Co^{2+} substitution is the key parameter in the antiferromagnetic metal-superconductor transition. It is unclear which of the two mechanisms--the lattice parameter change and the disorder effect--is actually more responsible. Nevertheless, we propose that the introduction of randomness is the effective phase control method for situations when superconductivity and antiferromagnetism are competing in a bicritical manner.[29] In order to establish this conclusion, further experiments are expected to be performed in the future.

We next discuss how the superconducting phase is overtaken by the paramagnetic metallic phase at (x,y) = (0.44, 0.22). At this composition, R_{\rm H} still shows a T variation, indicative of the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations. This is in stark contrast to Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2}, where the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are largely smeared out when the superconductivity disappears.[30, 31] This contrasting behavior is likely to be related to the differences in the Fermi surface. In Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2}, most of the hole Fermi surfaces disappear in the vicinity of the superconductor-paramagnetic metal transition[12] whereas there are hole and electron Fermi surfaces with a nesting character in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} with x = 2y. Hence, we speculate that the superconductivity is not destroyed by the weakened antiferromagnetic fluctuations as a glue of Cooper pairs in the present system. A more plausible scenario is a pair-breaking effect due to the Co^{2+} ions,[32] which enter into the conducting Fe sheets. From our results, we estimate the critical Co^{2+} concentration to be y_{c} = 0.17-0.22.[33] This value is much smaller than the percolation threshold of impurities on the nearest-neighbor square lattice model 0.41.[19, 34] The pair breaking effect induced by the disorder is also relevant to the T_{c} decrease. Indeed, as can be seen from Fig. 1, T_{c} has a tendency to decrease with increasing y. Since various factors relevant to T_{c} such as the lattice constant (pnictoen height) and Fermi-surface shape also varies in the x-y plane, quantitative arguments on T_{c} are fairly difficult.

## V Conclusions

We report on the resistivity and Hall coefficient for single crystal Ba_{1-x}K_{x}(Fe_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}As_{2} (0 \leq x \leq 0.51, 0 \leq y \leq 0.22). We found a transition from the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase via a superconducting phase on the x = 2y line. The static antiferromagnetic order is destabilized by the combined effect of the in-plane lattice contraction and the site disorder introduced by the Co^{2+} substitution. The superconducting phase is replaced by a paramagnetic phase owing to the pair-breaking effect of the substituted Co^{2+} ions.
