###### Abstract

Structural, magnetic, calorimetric, and transport studies have been made on a synthesized Tl(1212) system of Tl(Ba_{1-x}Sr_{x})_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b}(0 \leq x\leq1). Based on x-ray Rietveld refinement data, the bond length between Pr and oxygen in the adjacent CuO_{2} layers increases with increasing x, even though the tetragonal lattice parameters decrease with progressive Sr substitution. This may result in a lower degree of hybridization between extended Pr 4f and O 2_p_p_ orbitals and a corresponding reduction of superexchange magnetic coupling strength among Pr moments. Indeed, the anomalously high Neel temperature T_{N}(Pr) decreases from 8.0-8.2 K for x=0 to 3.6-4.2 K for x=1. The magnetic entropy associated with this antiferromagnetic Pr ordering is estimated from specific-heat data, in which a heavy-fermion-like contribution also prevails.

## I Introduction

PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is the only nonsuperconducting member of the orthorhombic _R_Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} system with R = Y and most rare-earth elements.[1]^{-}[4] The dramatic suppression of superconducting transition temperature from above 90 K and the anomalously high antiferromagnetic Pr ordering temperature T_{N}(Pr) of 17 K remain to be among the most intriguing topics in high-T_{c} research.[1]^{-}[6] The strong hybridization between the Pr 4f and the eight O 2_p_p_ orbitals in the adjacent CuO_{2} layers is believed responsible for both the suppression of superconductivity and the anomalous Pr ordering. The proposed T_{c} suppression mechanisms of either hole filling by Pr^{4+} ions or hole localization by Pr^{3+} ions is presumably associated with the hybridization.[4]^{-}[7] For the entire oxygen-deficient orthorhombic-tetragonal semiconducting system PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (0.0 \leq y\leq 1.0), Cu^{2+} moments become ordered antiferromagnetically above room temperature.[8] Meanwhile, T_{N}(Pr) decreases from 17 K for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (y\approx 0.0) to 10 K for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} (y\approx 1.0).[9] In comparison, the next highest T_{N}(_R_) for the _R_Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system is 2.2 K for GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}.[10; 11] Since Pr is one of the lighter elements of rare-earth series, its 4f wave functions should be more extended. The anomalously high T_{N}(Pr) indicates the importance of quasi-two-dimensional Pr-O-Pr superexchange mechanism through the strong hybridization between the Pr 4f and the eight O 2_p_p_ orbitals in the adjacent CuO_{2} layers.[12] The degree of hybridization is expected to follow the bond length _d_[Pr-O]. Crystallographic data indicate that this bond length increases with decreasing T_{N}(Pr) value, from approximate-by 2.451 A for orthorhombic PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with T_{N}(Pr) = 17 K to 2.472 A for tetragonal PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} with T_{N}(Pr) = 10 K.[9; 13]

A similar Pr anomaly occurs in other two-CuO_{2}-layered systems.[14; 15] A recent report on the new Tl(1212) compound of TlBa_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b} has revealed a broad Pr ordering near 8-10 K from magnetic-susceptibility and specific-heat measurements.[14] This is corroborated by the magnetic \langle\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\rangle,[12] Bragg line in neutron diffraction, which also yields magnetic lattice parameters of a_{m}=2a and c_{m}=2c. The extrapolated Pr-sublattice saturation moment along the c axis is 1.1\mu_{B} /Pr. It is smaller than the calculated Pr^{3+} (4_f_^{2},^{3}H_{4}) value of _gJ_ = 3.2\mu_{B}. The discrepancy may be originated from the complex crystal-field effect on the more extended Pr 4f wave functions, which are not completely shielded by the 5_s_^{2}5_p_^{6} outer shells, in addition to a strong quasi-two-dimensional quantum spin fluctuation.[16] The tetragonal TlBa_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{7-b}-type structure (space group P4/_mmm_) of TlBa_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b} is very similar to the orthorhombic-tetragonal lattice (space group _P_/_mmm_ or P4/_mmm_) of the PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system. In fact, by rewriting the formula of TlBa_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7} to PrBa_{2}(TlCu_{2})O_{7}, its only difference from PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is the replacement of the Cu-O chains by the Tl-O planes.[14; 17] Cu^{2+} moments also become ordered antiferromagnetically around T_{N}(Cu) \approx 370 K.[16] Again, in comparison, the next two highest T_{N}(_R_) values for the TlBa_{2}RCu_{2}O_{7-b} system are 2.2 K for TlBa_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7-b}, 1.5 K for TlBa_{2}NdCu_{2}O_{7-b} and 0.94 K for TlBa_{2}DyCu_{2}O_{7-b}.[18; 20] Preliminary Cu NMR study yields additional support to the strong hybridization between CuO_{2} layers and Pr orbitals.[20] The anomalous unit-cell volume variation as compared with other R 3^{+} rare-earth compounds TlBa_{2}R Cu_{2}O_{7-b} also supports this argument.[21] To further explore this mechanism, the Tl-1212 study has been extended to the newly found TlSr_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b} compound and the Tl(Ba_{1-x}Sr_{x})_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b}, solid solution system. The smaller Sr^{2+} radius (1.12 A) as compared to that of Ba^{2+} (1.34 A) should lead to a modification of such hybridiza  

## II Experiments

Seven Tl(Ba1-aSr_x)2PrCu2O7-d samples (_x_ = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) were prepared by solid-state-reaction techniques. Synthesis of the x = 0 sample followed the same procedures as given in Ref. 14. For each Sr-substituted sample, high-purity SrCO3, BaCO3, Pr6O11, and CuO powders in a stoichiometric ratio were thoroughly mixed, ground, and calcined at 900 degC for 12 h. After an appropriate amount of Tl2O3 was added, the powders were pressed into pellets, wrapped in gold foils, and individually placed in a gold-foil-covered alumina crucible. The pellets were reacted and fully oxygenated by annealing in flowing oxygen at 880-980 degC for 5-10 h, followed by furnace cool (_x_ < 1.0) or liquid nitrogen quench (_x_ = 1).

Structural analysis was obtained from a Rigaku Rotaflex rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation. Rietveld refinement method provided detailed crystallographic data.

Magnetic-susceptibility data were obtained using a Quantum Design MPMS superconducting-quantum-interference-device magnetometer down to 2 K in an applied magnetic field of 1 T. Specific-heat data between 2 and 15 K were generated using an adiabatic calorimeter with pulsed joule heating, the heat capacity of which was separately determined for addenda correction. ac electrical-resistivity data were obtained using the standard four-probe method with a 1 mA current of 16 Hz down to 10 K in a closed-cycle refrigerator.

## III Results and Discussion

TISr2PrCu2O7-d is successfully synthesized for the first time. Powder x-ray-diffraction patterns in Fig. 1 indicate that this tetragonal compound with lattice parameters a = 3.854(2) A, c = 12.108(4) A, and unit-cell volume V of 179.8(1) A3 is isostructural to TlBa2PrCu2O7-d [_a_ = 3.918(2) A, c = 12.550(4) A, and V = 192.7(1) A3]. An homogeneous single-phase solid solution appears in the substitutional compounds Tl(Ba1-aSr_x)2PrCu2O7-d with x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. The compositional variations of a, c, and V are shown in Fig. 2. The lattice parameters decrease steadily with increasing x. This is expected, considering the relative size of Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions. However, volume reduction of 12.88 A3 due to full Sr substitution is much larger than the estimated 8.38 A3 from simple ionic volume calculation. Further in-depth analysis on four samples (_x_ = 0, 0.5, 0.6, 1) from detailed x-ray Rietveld refinement [22, 23] becomes relevant. Typical crystallographic parameter refinement data for the parent compound TlBa2PrCu2O7-d (_b_ = 0.07) with refinement factors _R_P = 5.09% and _R_WP = 6.89% are listed in Table 1. The small Tl deficiency (6%) arises from the high Tl volatility during the sample preparation process. The Pr-O(3) bond lengths

\[d\left[ {\text{Pr-O}(3)} \right] = \{(a/2)^2 + [(0.5-z)c]^2 \}^{0.5}\;,\]

where O(3) refers to oxygen ions in the CuO2 layers, and z is a crystallographic parameter as listed in Table 1. Of particular importance is the fact that, in spite of the steady decrease of lattice parameters a and c, the bond length _d_[Pr-O(3)] increases slightly from 2.478(5) A for x = 0 to 2.514(2) A for x = 1 due to a decrease in z value (from 0.379 to 0.368).

 verse molar magnetic susceptibility \chi_{m}^{-1} in an applied magnetic field of 1 T for three typical samples with x =0, 0.5, and 1. Their Cu2+ moments are already ordered antiferromagnetically above room temperature.16,24 Because of the extended 4f wave functions of light rare-earth Pr, the crystal-field effect is comparable to the exchange interaction. Therefore, no simple Curie-Weiss behavior is observed even in the relatively high applied field. However, the data can be roughly fitted by the relation \chi(T) = \chi_{0} + C/(T + \theta_{P}), with a negative paramagnetic intercept of |_th_|  7 K for x =0, 7.5 K for x =0.5, and 10 K for x = 1. The effect moment m_{f} derived from the fitted Curie constant is 2.70_m__b_ for x =0, 2.77_m__b_ for x =0.5, and 2.73_m__b_ for x = 1. For reference, the calculated crystal-field configuration in the orthorhomic PrBa2Cu3O7 compound gives a quasitriplet ground state from the inelastic-neutron-scattering data.7,25,26 Also to be noted is that a preliminary neutron-diffraction study on Tl(Ba1-_x_Sr_x_)2PrCu2O7-_d_ with x =0.5 indicates a complicated Cu spin reoriented structure below room temperature.24

Low-temperature derivatives of molar magnetic susceptibility d\chi_{m}/dT for the same three samples (_x_ =0, 0.5, 1) are presented in Fig. 4. The minimum in d\chi_{m}/dT corresponds to the inflection point in \chi_{m}(T), which is generally taken as the antiferromagnetic Pr ordering temperature T_{N}(Pr). The broad transitions vary monotonically from approximately 8.0 K for x =0, 5.0 K for x =0.5, to 3.6 K for x = 1. Compositional variations of T_{N}(Pr) and bond length _d_[Pr-O(3)] are summarized in Fig. 5 and listed in Table 2. The correlation between x dependence of T_{N}(Pr) and _d_[Pr-O(3)] is evident, and is consistent with a similar observation for the PrBa2Cu3O7-_y_ system. For the latter, the Pr-O bond length increases from 2.451 A for orthorhombic PrBa2Cu3O7 with T_{N}(Pr) = 17 K to 2.479 A for tetragonal PrBa2Cu3O6 with T_{N}(Pr) = 10 K.9,13

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of molar specific heat C for x =0, 0.5, and 1. Also included are data for a nonmagnetic reference compound TlBa2YCu2O7-_g_.14 The latter has only a lattice contribution C_{1} = \beta T^{3} equivalent to a Debye temperature \Theta_{D} = 250 K. The specific-heat anomaly in each sample is certainly a corroboration to the magnetic data as an indication of the antiferromagnetic Pr ordering around 8.2 K for x = 1, 5.4 K for x = 0.5, and 4.2 K for x = 1, even though the broad peak makes it difficult to unambiguously identify T_{N}(Pr). It is of interest to point out that, for x =0 and 0.5, T_{N}(Pr) values of 8 K and 6 K, respectively, have been confirmed by neutron diffraction.16,23 The enhanced transition widths may result from the quasi-two-dimensional short-range magnetic correlation above T_{N}(Pr) and the strong hybridization of Pr 4f and adjacent oxygen states.25,26

Above 10 K, the specific-heat data for all samples can be fitted to the sum of a T3-dependent lattice contribution C_{1} = \beta T^{3} and a linear term _gT_. The Debye temperature \Theta_{D} as derived from b varies from 280 K for x = 0, 290 K for x = 0.5, to 350 K for x = 1. Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of \Delta C/T = (C - C_{1})/T. The g values thus derived above T_{N} are included in Table 2. These exceptionally large, heavy-Fermion-like linear terms seem to prevail in many other Pr-containing high-_T__c_ systems.6,27,28 Their origin, however, remains to be

The area integral below each set of data equals the entropy change \Delta S = \int [(C - \beta T^{3})/T]dT with the lattice contribution excluded. A question remains as to what fraction of \Delta C is associated with the ordering process. Basically, the yet-to-be-understood \gamma T term extends to above T_{N}, and its presence at lower temperatures should be excluded from the integration toward estimating the magnetic ordering-related entropy \Delta S_{m}. Nevertheless, the \gamma value may not remain constant below T_{N}, because of possible change in magnetic correlations. Without such information at present, the horizontal dashed line simply represents the constant \gamma T extrapolation from higher temperatures. Accordingly, the \Delta S_{m} values between 2 and 10 K are derived from \int (C_{m}/T)dT with C_{m} = C - \beta T^{3} - \gamma\,T. The estimated magnetic entropy values are only fractions of R ln2 or R ln3 corresponding to a doublet ground state of Pr^{4 +} or a quasitriplet ground state of Pr^{3 +}. 7 The extra contribution below 2 K as well as the uncertainty in \gamma\,(T < T_{N}) could enhance the \Delta S_{m} estimates.

Electrical-resistivity data show a temperature dependence characteristic of a semiconducting variable-range hopping behavior for all samples. There is, however, very dramatic variation of room-temperature resistivity, which decreases sharply from 9600 \Omega cm for x = 0 to 157 \Omega cm for x = 0.5 and 0.189 \Omega cm for x = 1.

It seems that these anomalous magnetic and electrical properties can be understood through the strong hybridization between the Pr 4f orbital and the adjacent eight O 2p \pi orbitals in the CuO_{2} layers. As mentioned earlier, this strong hybridization is originated from the extended 4f wave function of the light rare earth Pr. The degree of hybridization can be reflected in the bond length _d_[Pr-O(3)]. Progressive replacement of larger Ba^{2 +} ions by smaller Sr^{2 +} ions decreases the bucking angle between Cu and O(3) ions in the CuO_{2} layers, which in turn may lengthen the net bond length between Pr and O(3). As a consequence, the superexchange coupling strength through Pr-O-Pr and, therefore, the Pr ordering temperature T_{N}(Pr) decrease with increasing Sr substitution. Meanwhile, an effective coupling occurs between Cu and Pr moments through oxygen 2p \sigma/2p \pi as revealed by preliminary neutron and NMR studies. 20, 24 This competition should be taken into account before a final conclusion can be reached.

## IV Conclusion

The structural, magnetic, calorimetric, and transport studies have been made on the newly synthesized Tl(1212) system of Tl(Ba_{1-x}Sr_{x})_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-\delta} (0 \leq x\leq 1). X-ray Rietveld refinement data indicate an increasing Pr-O(3) bond length between Pr and eight oxygen ions in the adjacent CuO_{2} layers, even though the tetragonal lattice parameters decrease with progressive Sr substitution. Consequently, the degree of hybridization between the extended 4f orbital of light rare-earth Pr and O 2p \pi orbitals is reduced. This may result in a corresponding reduction of superexchange magnetic coupling strength among Pr moments. Indeed, an anomalously high antiferromagnetic Pr ordering temperature T_{N}(Pr) decreases from 8 K at x=0 to 4 K at x=1. The magnetic entropy associated with this transition is estimated from specific-heat data, in which a heavy-Fermion-like contribution also prevails. More diverse and detailed studies are in progress.

###### Abstract

Structural, magnetic, calorimetric, and transport studies have been made on a synthesized Tl(1212) system of Tl(Ba_{1-x}Sr_{x})_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b}(0 \leq x\leq1). Based on x-ray Rietveld refinement data, the bond length between Pr and oxygen in the adjacent CuO_{2} layers increases with increasing x, even though the tetragonal lattice parameters decrease with progressive Sr substitution. This may result in a lower degree of hybridization between extended Pr 4f and O 2_p_p_ orbitals and a corresponding reduction of superexchange magnetic coupling strength among Pr moments. Indeed, the anomalously high Neel temperature T_{N}(Pr) decreases from 8.0-8.2 K for x=0 to 3.6-4.2 K for x=1. The magnetic entropy associated with this antiferromagnetic Pr ordering is estimated from specific-heat data, in which a heavy-fermion-like contribution also prevails.

## I Introduction

PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is the only nonsuperconducting member of the orthorhombic _R_Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} system with R = Y and most rare-earth elements.[1]^{-}[4] The dramatic suppression of superconducting transition temperature from above 90 K and the anomalously high antiferromagnetic Pr ordering temperature T_{N}(Pr) of 17 K remain to be among the most intriguing topics in high-T_{c} research.[1]^{-}[6] The strong hybridization between the Pr 4f and the eight O 2_p_p_ orbitals in the adjacent CuO_{2} layers is believed responsible for both the suppression of superconductivity and the anomalous Pr ordering. The proposed T_{c} suppression mechanisms of either hole filling by Pr^{4+} ions or hole localization by Pr^{3+} ions is presumably associated with the hybridization.[4]^{-}[7] For the entire oxygen-deficient orthorhombic-tetragonal semiconducting system PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (0.0 \leq y\leq 1.0), Cu^{2+} moments become ordered antiferromagnetically above room temperature.[8] Meanwhile, T_{N}(Pr) decreases from 17 K for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (y\approx 0.0) to 10 K for PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} (y\approx 1.0).[9] In comparison, the next highest T_{N}(_R_) for the _R_Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system is 2.2 K for GdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}.[10; 11] Since Pr is one of the lighter elements of rare-earth series, its 4f wave functions should be more extended. The anomalously high T_{N}(Pr) indicates the importance of quasi-two-dimensional Pr-O-Pr superexchange mechanism through the strong hybridization between the Pr 4f and the eight O 2_p_p_ orbitals in the adjacent CuO_{2} layers.[12] The degree of hybridization is expected to follow the bond length _d_[Pr-O]. Crystallographic data indicate that this bond length increases with decreasing T_{N}(Pr) value, from approximate-by 2.451 A for orthorhombic PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with T_{N}(Pr) = 17 K to 2.472 A for tetragonal PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6} with T_{N}(Pr) = 10 K.[9; 13]

A similar Pr anomaly occurs in other two-CuO_{2}-layered systems.[14; 15] A recent report on the new Tl(1212) compound of TlBa_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b} has revealed a broad Pr ordering near 8-10 K from magnetic-susceptibility and specific-heat measurements.[14] This is corroborated by the magnetic \langle\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\rangle,[12] Bragg line in neutron diffraction, which also yields magnetic lattice parameters of a_{m}=2a and c_{m}=2c. The extrapolated Pr-sublattice saturation moment along the c axis is 1.1\mu_{B} /Pr. It is smaller than the calculated Pr^{3+} (4_f_^{2},^{3}H_{4}) value of _gJ_ = 3.2\mu_{B}. The discrepancy may be originated from the complex crystal-field effect on the more extended Pr 4f wave functions, which are not completely shielded by the 5_s_^{2}5_p_^{6} outer shells, in addition to a strong quasi-two-dimensional quantum spin fluctuation.[16] The tetragonal TlBa_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{7-b}-type structure (space group P4/_mmm_) of TlBa_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b} is very similar to the orthorhombic-tetragonal lattice (space group _P_/_mmm_ or P4/_mmm_) of the PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system. In fact, by rewriting the formula of TlBa_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7} to PrBa_{2}(TlCu_{2})O_{7}, its only difference from PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is the replacement of the Cu-O chains by the Tl-O planes.[14; 17] Cu^{2+} moments also become ordered antiferromagnetically around T_{N}(Cu) \approx 370 K.[16] Again, in comparison, the next two highest T_{N}(_R_) values for the TlBa_{2}RCu_{2}O_{7-b} system are 2.2 K for TlBa_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7-b}, 1.5 K for TlBa_{2}NdCu_{2}O_{7-b} and 0.94 K for TlBa_{2}DyCu_{2}O_{7-b}.[18; 20] Preliminary Cu NMR study yields additional support to the strong hybridization between CuO_{2} layers and Pr orbitals.[20] The anomalous unit-cell volume variation as compared with other R 3^{+} rare-earth compounds TlBa_{2}R Cu_{2}O_{7-b} also supports this argument.[21] To further explore this mechanism, the Tl-1212 study has been extended to the newly found TlSr_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b} compound and the Tl(Ba_{1-x}Sr_{x})_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-b}, solid solution system. The smaller Sr^{2+} radius (1.12 A) as compared to that of Ba^{2+} (1.34 A) should lead to a modification of such hybridiza  

## II Experiments

Seven Tl(Ba1-aSr_x)2PrCu2O7-d samples (_x_ = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) were prepared by solid-state-reaction techniques. Synthesis of the x = 0 sample followed the same procedures as given in Ref. 14. For each Sr-substituted sample, high-purity SrCO3, BaCO3, Pr6O11, and CuO powders in a stoichiometric ratio were thoroughly mixed, ground, and calcined at 900 degC for 12 h. After an appropriate amount of Tl2O3 was added, the powders were pressed into pellets, wrapped in gold foils, and individually placed in a gold-foil-covered alumina crucible. The pellets were reacted and fully oxygenated by annealing in flowing oxygen at 880-980 degC for 5-10 h, followed by furnace cool (_x_ < 1.0) or liquid nitrogen quench (_x_ = 1).

Structural analysis was obtained from a Rigaku Rotaflex rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation. Rietveld refinement method provided detailed crystallographic data.

Magnetic-susceptibility data were obtained using a Quantum Design MPMS superconducting-quantum-interference-device magnetometer down to 2 K in an applied magnetic field of 1 T. Specific-heat data between 2 and 15 K were generated using an adiabatic calorimeter with pulsed joule heating, the heat capacity of which was separately determined for addenda correction. ac electrical-resistivity data were obtained using the standard four-probe method with a 1 mA current of 16 Hz down to 10 K in a closed-cycle refrigerator.

## III Results and Discussion

TISr2PrCu2O7-d is successfully synthesized for the first time. Powder x-ray-diffraction patterns in Fig. 1 indicate that this tetragonal compound with lattice parameters a = 3.854(2) A, c = 12.108(4) A, and unit-cell volume V of 179.8(1) A3 is isostructural to TlBa2PrCu2O7-d [_a_ = 3.918(2) A, c = 12.550(4) A, and V = 192.7(1) A3]. An homogeneous single-phase solid solution appears in the substitutional compounds Tl(Ba1-aSr_x)2PrCu2O7-d with x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8. The compositional variations of a, c, and V are shown in Fig. 2. The lattice parameters decrease steadily with increasing x. This is expected, considering the relative size of Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions. However, volume reduction of 12.88 A3 due to full Sr substitution is much larger than the estimated 8.38 A3 from simple ionic volume calculation. Further in-depth analysis on four samples (_x_ = 0, 0.5, 0.6, 1) from detailed x-ray Rietveld refinement [22, 23] becomes relevant. Typical crystallographic parameter refinement data for the parent compound TlBa2PrCu2O7-d (_b_ = 0.07) with refinement factors _R_P = 5.09% and _R_WP = 6.89% are listed in Table 1. The small Tl deficiency (6%) arises from the high Tl volatility during the sample preparation process. The Pr-O(3) bond lengths

\[d\left[ {\text{Pr-O}(3)} \right] = \{(a/2)^2 + [(0.5-z)c]^2 \}^{0.5}\;,\]

where O(3) refers to oxygen ions in the CuO2 layers, and z is a crystallographic parameter as listed in Table 1. Of particular importance is the fact that, in spite of the steady decrease of lattice parameters a and c, the bond length _d_[Pr-O(3)] increases slightly from 2.478(5) A for x = 0 to 2.514(2) A for x = 1 due to a decrease in z value (from 0.379 to 0.368).

Figure 3 presents the temperature dependence of in

 verse molar magnetic susceptibility \chi_{m}^{-1} in an applied magnetic field of 1 T for three typical samples with x =0, 0.5, and 1. Their Cu2+ moments are already ordered antiferromagnetically above room temperature.16,24 Because of the extended 4f wave functions of light rare-earth Pr, the crystal-field effect is comparable to the exchange interaction. Therefore, no simple Curie-Weiss behavior is observed even in the relatively high applied field. However, the data can be roughly fitted by the relation \chi(T) = \chi_{0} + C/(T + \theta_{P}), with a negative paramagnetic intercept of |_th_|  7 K for x =0, 7.5 K for x =0.5, and 10 K for x = 1. The effect moment m_{f} derived from the fitted Curie constant is 2.70_m__b_ for x =0, 2.77_m__b_ for x =0.5, and 2.73_m__b_ for x = 1. For reference, the calculated crystal-field configuration in the orthorhomic PrBa2Cu3O7 compound gives a quasitriplet ground state from the inelastic-neutron-scattering data.7,25,26 Also to be noted is that a preliminary neutron-diffraction study on Tl(Ba1-_x_Sr_x_)2PrCu2O7-_d_ with x =0.5 indicates a complicated Cu spin reoriented structure below room temperature.24

Low-temperature derivatives of molar magnetic susceptibility d\chi_{m}/dT for the same three samples (_x_ =0, 0.5, 1) are presented in Fig. 4. The minimum in d\chi_{m}/dT corresponds to the inflection point in \chi_{m}(T), which is generally taken as the antiferromagnetic Pr ordering temperature T_{N}(Pr). The broad transitions vary monotonically from approximately 8.0 K for x =0, 5.0 K for x =0.5, to 3.6 K for x = 1. Compositional variations of T_{N}(Pr) and bond length _d_[Pr-O(3)] are summarized in Fig. 5 and listed in Table 2. The correlation between x dependence of T_{N}(Pr) and _d_[Pr-O(3)] is evident, and is consistent with a similar observation for the PrBa2Cu3O7-_y_ system. For the latter, the Pr-O bond length increases from 2.451 A for orthorhombic PrBa2Cu3O7 with T_{N}(Pr) = 17 K to 2.479 A for tetragonal PrBa2Cu3O6 with T_{N}(Pr) = 10 K.9,13

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of molar specific heat C for x =0, 0.5, and 1. Also included are data for a nonmagnetic reference compound TlBa2YCu2O7-_g_.14 The latter has only a lattice contribution C_{1} = \beta T^{3} equivalent to a Debye temperature \Theta_{D} = 250 K. The specific-heat anomaly in each sample is certainly a corroboration to the magnetic data as an indication of the antiferromagnetic Pr ordering around 8.2 K for x = 1, 5.4 K for x = 0.5, and 4.2 K for x = 1, even though the broad peak makes it difficult to unambiguously identify T_{N}(Pr). It is of interest to point out that, for x =0 and 0.5, T_{N}(Pr) values of 8 K and 6 K, respectively, have been confirmed by neutron diffraction.16,23 The enhanced transition widths may result from the quasi-two-dimensional short-range magnetic correlation above T_{N}(Pr) and the strong hybridization of Pr 4f and adjacent oxygen states.25,26

Above 10 K, the specific-heat data for all samples can be fitted to the sum of a T3-dependent lattice contribution C_{1} = \beta T^{3} and a linear term _gT_. The Debye temperature \Theta_{D} as derived from b varies from 280 K for x = 0, 290 K for x = 0.5, to 350 K for x = 1. Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of \Delta C/T = (C - C_{1})/T. The g values thus derived above T_{N} are included in Table 2. These exceptionally large, heavy-Fermion-like linear terms seem to prevail in many other Pr-containing high-_T__c_ systems.6,27,28 Their origin, however, remains to be

R_{P} = 5.09%, specific heat _γ_, effective magnetic moment _μ_eff and Pr-O(3) bond length _d_[Pr-O(3)] for the Tl(Ba1−_x_Sr_x_)2PrCu2O7−8 system  identified. The area integral below each set of data equals the entropy change \Delta S = \int [(C - \beta T^{3})/T]dT with the lattice contribution excluded. A question remains as to what fraction of \Delta C is associated with the ordering process. Basically, the yet-to-be-understood \gamma T term extends to above T_{N}, and its presence at lower temperatures should be excluded from the integration toward estimating the magnetic ordering-related entropy \Delta S_{m}. Nevertheless, the \gamma value may not remain constant below T_{N}, because of possible change in magnetic correlations. Without such information at present, the horizontal dashed line simply represents the constant \gamma T extrapolation from higher temperatures. Accordingly, the \Delta S_{m} values between 2 and 10 K are derived from \int (C_{m}/T)dT with C_{m} = C - \beta T^{3} - \gamma\,T. The estimated magnetic entropy values are only fractions of R ln2 or R ln3 corresponding to a doublet ground state of Pr^{4 +} or a quasitriplet ground state of Pr^{3 +}. 7 The extra contribution below 2 K as well as the uncertainty in \gamma\,(T < T_{N}) could enhance the \Delta S_{m} estimates.

Electrical-resistivity data show a temperature dependence characteristic of a semiconducting variable-range hopping behavior for all samples. There is, however, very dramatic variation of room-temperature resistivity, which decreases sharply from 9600 \Omega cm for x = 0 to 157 \Omega cm for x = 0.5 and 0.189 \Omega cm for x = 1.

It seems that these anomalous magnetic and electrical properties can be understood through the strong hybridization between the Pr 4f orbital and the adjacent eight O 2p \pi orbitals in the CuO_{2} layers. As mentioned earlier, this strong hybridization is originated from the extended 4f wave function of the light rare earth Pr. The degree of hybridization can be reflected in the bond length _d_[Pr-O(3)]. Progressive replacement of larger Ba^{2 +} ions by smaller Sr^{2 +} ions decreases the bucking angle between Cu and O(3) ions in the CuO_{2} layers, which in turn may lengthen the net bond length between Pr and O(3). As a consequence, the superexchange coupling strength through Pr-O-Pr and, therefore, the Pr ordering temperature T_{N}(Pr) decrease with increasing Sr substitution. Meanwhile, an effective coupling occurs between Cu and Pr moments through oxygen 2p \sigma/2p \pi as revealed by preliminary neutron and NMR studies. 20, 24 This competition should be taken into account before a final conclusion can be reached.

## IV Conclusion

The structural, magnetic, calorimetric, and transport studies have been made on the newly synthesized Tl(1212) system of Tl(Ba_{1-x}Sr_{x})_{2}PrCu_{2}O_{7-\delta} (0 \leq x\leq 1). X-ray Rietveld refinement data indicate an increasing Pr-O(3) bond length between Pr and eight oxygen ions in the adjacent CuO_{2} layers, even though the tetragonal lattice parameters decrease with progressive Sr substitution. Consequently, the degree of hybridization between the extended 4f orbital of light rare-earth Pr and O 2p \pi orbitals is reduced. This may result in a corresponding reduction of superexchange magnetic coupling strength among Pr moments. Indeed, an anomalously high antiferromagnetic Pr ordering temperature T_{N}(Pr) decreases from 8 K at x=0 to 4 K at x=1. The magnetic entropy associated with this transition is estimated from specific-heat data, in which a heavy-Fermion-like contribution also prevails. More diverse and detailed studies are in progress.
