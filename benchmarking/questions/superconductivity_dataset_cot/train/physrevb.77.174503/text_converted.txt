###### Abstract

The crystal structure and numerous normal and superconducting state
properties of layered tetragonal (P4/nmm) LaFeAsO, with F doping of ∼11

## I Introduction

Recently, an oxide family of layered tetragonal superconductors
containing the transition metal elements Fe and Ni has been reported:
LaFePO (T_(c)=4 K, increasing to T_(c)∼ 7 K with F doping),[1, 2] LaNiPO
(T_(c)=3 K),[3] and LaFeAsO (T_(c)=26 K at 5

The focus of this study is the LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) system with nominal
composition of x= 0.11.[9, 10, 4] The large reported T_(c) of
approximately 26 K in this compound is very exciting because of the
similarities between this layered transition metal compound and the high
T_(c) cuprates. Its discovery may lead to related superconducting
compounds with potentially higher T_(c)’s, but may also provide insight
into superconductivity in layered transition metal oxides. The
experimental details below are followed by a discussion of the
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) crystal structure. The thermodynamic and
transport properties of this material will then be presented and
discussed. The measurements include temperature-dependent Hall effect,
field- and temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, electrical
resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline samples with LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) nominal composition
were prepared by a standard solid-state synthesis method similar to that
reported by Kamihara _et al.[4]_ First, LaAs was prepared by placing
mixtures of La (purity 99.9

The phase purity and structural identification were made via powder
x-ray diffraction by using a Scintag XDS 2000 θ-θ diffractometer (Cu Kα
radiation). Data for Rietveld[11] refinement were collected over a 2 θ
range of 15^(∘)-120^(∘) with a step size of 0.02^(∘) and a counting time
of 10 s/step. The data were refined with main phase of
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) (Ref. [4]) and small impurity phase of
La_(4.67)(SiO₄)₃O.[12] Refined parameters include zero point offset, ten
background polynomial coefficients, two asymmetry parameters, scale
factors, preferred orientation, shape and half-width parameters, lattice
constants, the two variable atomic positions in LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11)
(z coordinates for La and As), and overall isotropic displacement
parameters. As expected, the fit was relatively insensitive to the O:F
ratio, which was fixed at the nominal value for the final refinement
cycles. Atomic positions of the lanthanum silicate oxide phase were not
refined but fixed at the literature values.

Electron probe microanalysis of a polished surface of the
polycrystalline pellet was performed on a JEOL JSM-840 scanning electron
microscope (SEM) by using an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and a current
of 20 nA with an energy-dispersive x-ray analysis brand
energy-dispersive spectroscopy device attached to the SEM. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) data were collected on a Hitachi HF-3300
TEM/scanning TEM at 300 kV.

dc magnetization was measured as a function of temperature using a
Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System. For a temperature
sweep experiment, the sample was zero-field cooled (ZFC) to 1.8 K and
data were collected by warming from 2 to 300 K in an applied field.

The sample was then field cooled (FC) in the applied field, and the
measurement repeated from 1.8 K. The magnetic susceptibility results may
be presented per mole of LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) f.u. (cm³/mol).

Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and
Seebeck coefficient measurements were obtained by using a Quantum Design
Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). For dc resistance
measurements, electrical contacts were placed on samples in standard
four-probe geometry by using Pt wires and silver epoxy (EPOTEK H20E).
The Hall component was found from the Hall resistivity (ρ_(xy)) under
magnetic field reversal at a given

## III Results and discussion

### Powder x-ray diffraction and microanalysis

Results of Rietveld refinement of the diffraction data are shown in Fig.
1(b). The overall agreement factors are R_(p) = 1.36 and $R_{\rm up}$ =
1.86. The quality of the refinement is satisfactory, as indicated by the
value of χ²=2.20. $R_{\rm Bragg}$ for the target phase is low (8.32),
which indicates a good fit. For the secondary phase of La_(4.67)(SiO₄)O,
the refinement was impeded by its small presence, complexity of the
structure, and the overlap between strong peaks of the two phases giving
$R_{\rm Bragg}$=24.1. However, excluding this phase reduces the quality
of the overall refinement (χ²=3.30). Quantitative phase analysis was
precluded by the poor refinement of the secondary phase. Inspection of a
polished surface under optical microscope and SEM (described below)
suggests ≈5

The refined lattice constants of LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) are a =4.0277(2)
A and c = 8.7125(4) A, as shown in Fig. 1(b). These values compare well
with that reported for 5

Electron probe microanalysis and SEM are used to complement powder x-ray
diffraction data for further investigation of sample purity.
Standardless, semiquantitative analysis of energy-dispersive x-ray
spectra confirm the presence of La, Fe, As, O, and F with La:Fe:As =
1:1:1. Reliable estimates of the F content are precluded by the near
exact overlap of the F K and Fe L lines in the microprobe data; however,
the presence of F is suggested by the excess intensity of the line near
Fe L and independently confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
measurements. There is no fluorine-containing secondary phase observed
in electron probe microanalysis, but there is the presence of small
amounts of Fe₂As and the lanthanum silicate oxide impurity phases. No
indication of Fe₂As is observed in the powder diffraction data, limiting
the concentration of this impurity to less than a few percent. It is
likely that the lanthanum silicate is formed by reaction with SiO vapor
present in the silica tubes at the high temperatures of 1250 ^(∘)C, at
which the sample is formed. TEM images and fast Fourier transform (FFT)
calculated diffraction patterns for two crystallographic orientations of
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) are shown in Fig. 1(c). The view along the c axis
and that perpendicular to it are shown on top and bottom, respectively.
The lengths of the a and c axes are labeled. The layered nature of the
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) structure is clearly visible.

### Physical properties

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility
χ measured under ZFC and FC conditions at 20 Oe. The susceptibility
becomes negative below 27.5 K. The shielding fraction is given by the
ZFC data and the Meissner fraction by the FC curve. Assuming theoretical
density of 6.68 g/cm³, a shielding fraction of 74

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity (ρ) in zero field. At room temperature, $\rho_{300\;\rm K}$
= 2.7 mΩ cm, which is comparable to the reported val

Figure 4(a) illustrates that the resistive transition for
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) shifts to lower temperatures by applying a
magnetic field. The transition width becomes wider with increasing H,
which is a characteristic of type-II superconductivity. Here, we define
a transition temperature T_(c)(H) that satisfies the condition that
ρ(T_(c),H) equals a fixed percentage of the normal-state value (ρ_(N))
for each field H. The T_(c)(H) values for ρ=10

formula is $\xi_{\rm GL}$=(Φ₀/2 / 2 πH_(c2))^(1/2), where Φ₀=2.07 × 10⁻⁷
Oe cm². This yields zero temperature coherence length $\xi_{\rm GL}$(0)
≈ 48 A for H_(c2)(10

The temperature-dependent specific heat for LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) has
no observable anomaly near T_(c). Although the large value of the
lattice specific heat near T_(c) would make the superconducting
contribution at T_(c) fairly small (of order 1-3

Figure 5 shows the results of temperature-dependent Hall data. The Hall
coefficient (Fig. 5, inset) is negative and gradually decreases with
decreasing temperature down to ∼ 130 K below which it is approximately
constant. If a single band is assumed, the inferred carrier
concentration is ≈ 1.7× 10²¹ electrons/cm³ at room temperature and ≈ 1 ×
10²¹ electrons/cm³ just above T_(c). Our Hall data are similar to those
recently reported.[9] The electronic structure calculations[8] also
predict a similar carrier concentration, as well as the presence of both
high velocity electron bands and heavy hole bands near the Fermi energy,
with the electron bands dominating in-plane transport. Because of the
possibility of some electrical conduction by holes, the low-temperature
carrier concentration of 1× 10²¹ electrons/cm³ should be regarded as an
upper bound for the electron carrier concentration just above T_(c).

The Seebeck coefficient of LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11), S, is shown in Fig.
6. S is negative and large, varying from −42 μV/K at 300 K to a maximum
negative value of ∼−95 μV/K at ∼ 130 K, then decreasing toward 0. The
maximum in the Seebeck coefficient and the slight temperature dependence
of the Hall data are probably due to the competition between dominant
electronlike bands and the expected proximity of holelike bands near the
Fermi energy.

The low-temperature Hall data and Seebeck coefficient (Figs. 5 and 6)
can be used to obtain a qualitative estimate of the effective mass of
the carriers m* and the Sommerfeld coefficient γ. If we assume that the
electron carrier concentration below ∼130 K is close to the value
inferred from the Hall data (1× 10²¹ electrons/cm³), the free electron
model predicts a Fermi energy (temperature) of 0.4 eV (4800 K).[19] The
Seebeck coefficient at 40 K is −60 μV/K and in the temperature regime,
roughly extrapolates linearly to 0 at T =0 (Fig. 6). In many normal low
carrier concentration metals,[18] the Seebeck coefficient is given by
the diffusion contribution of the Mott expression or S=
π²k_(B)T(2eT_(F))⁻¹, where T_(F) is the Fermi temperature. If we use a
value for of 4800 K for T_(F) in the expression for S, this results in a
Seebeck value of ≈−3.5 μV/K at 40 K, which is much smaller than the
measured value of −60 μV/K. These results imply a value for m*≈ 17 and a
corresponding value of γ = 11 mJ/K² mol,[19] which is about twice the
calculated density of states at E_(f) (γ₀=6.5 mJ/K² mol).[8] Although
this is clearly a crude estimate, it suggests that electronic
correlations are important in LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11), as were suggested
from ρ(T²) analyses above. We also note that the value of γ=4.1(1) mJ/K²
mol extracted from the specific heat data may reflect that a portion of
the LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) phase remains in the normal state.

For LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11), the temperature-dependent thermal
conductivity is displayed in Fig. 7. An anomaly at ≈28 K is clearly
evident. Because of the low carrier concentration and high resistivity,
most of the heat in this compound is carried

## IV Conclusions

The crystal structure, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat,
resistivity, Hall effect, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity
of the layered LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) superconductor were investigated
in this paper. The magnetic susceptibility clearly indicates bulk
superconductivity with Meissner fraction of ≈30
