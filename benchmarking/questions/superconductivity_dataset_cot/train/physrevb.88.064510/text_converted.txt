###### Abstract

We report the results of low-temperature heat capacity measurements of
the pnictide oxide superconductor BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO doped with sodium. The
temperature- and field-dependent heat capacity data are well described
by a single-gap BCS theory. The estimated values for the normal-state
Sommerfeld constant, the heat capacity jump at T_(c), and the
electron-phonon coupling constant are in favor of a conventional weak
coupling superconductivity mediated by electron-phonon interaction. The
results are discussed with regard to and compared with recent
first-principles calculations.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity in layered transition-metal compounds has been in the
focus of interest for several decades. The discovery of high-temperature
superconductivity in copper oxide perovskites as well as, more recently,
in iron pnictides and chalcogenides has initiated an immense activity in
superconductivity research. Questions about the role of the layered
structure, magnetic fluctuations, the proximity to magnetic order or a
possible quantum critical point, the symmetry of the superconducting
order parameter, etc. have been discussed extensively. There are
numerous examples showing that the superconducting state, usually
induced by carrier doping into a parent compound, is in close proximity
to spin or charge orders, for example antiferromagnetic order in copper
oxide and heavy-fermion superconductors, spin-density-wave (SDW) order
in iron pnictides, or charge-density-wave (CDW) order in layered
chalcogenides.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] The mutual interactions of different
fundamental orders open new perspectives to study novel physical
phenomena observable only in those strongly correlated superconducting
systems.

The search for similar layered transition-metal compounds has recently
led to the study of titanium-based pnictide oxide compounds of the
general chemical formulas A‚ÇÇTi‚ÇÇPn‚ÇÇO and AeTi‚ÇÇPn‚ÇÇO (Pn = As,Sb;A = Na; Ae
= Ba). This system was first synthesized and characterized more than two
decades ago[6] and it belongs to a larger family of pnictide oxides
including other transition metals.[7, 8, 9] The layered structure of
Na‚ÇÇTi‚ÇÇPn‚ÇÇO is characterized by Ti‚ÇÇPn‚ÇÇO blocks separated by a double
layer of A (Na) ions or single slabs of Ae (Ba). The titanium and oxygen
ions form square planar Ti‚ÇÇO sheets, which is inverse (anti) to the CuO‚ÇÇ
planes which form the active layer in superconducting copper oxides, in
that the positions of Ti and O in this square lattice are switched with
respect to the O and Cu sites in the cuprates. This raised the question
of whether or not a superconducting state can be induced through doping
of carriers into the Ti‚ÇÇO layer.[8]

The structure and chemical synthesis of Na‚ÇÇTi‚ÇÇPn‚ÇÇO have been studied in
detail for Pn = As and Sb.[6, 10, 11] The physical properties studied
via electrical transport and magnetic measurements reveal the existence
of an instability near T_(DW) = 115 K in Na‚ÇÇTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO where the magnetic
susceptibility shows a sharp drop to lower values and the resistivity
experiences a sudden increase.[12, 13, 11] However, it is not clear if
this instability originates from the formation of a charge-density wave
or a spin-density wave. First-principles calculations have found a
nesting feature of the Fermi surface which could explain the occurrence
of a SDW or CDW instability.[14] Powder neutron scattering experiments
have shown that this transition is also associated with a small
structural anomaly.[10] Recent optical studies have found the opening of
a gap and a change of the free-carrier spectral weight as well as a
reduction of the carrier scattering rate across the SDW-CDW
transition.[15] It is worth noting that the arsenic-based compound,
Na‚ÇÇTi‚ÇÇAs‚ÇÇO exhibits a similar density-wave transition at significantly
higher temperature, T_(DW) = 320 K.[13]

Replacing the Na‚ÇÇ double layer with a single layer of Ba ions forms
another stable pnictide oxide, BaTi‚ÇÇAs‚ÇÇO, with the c axis of the
tetragonal structure shortened by 50

Replacing As by Sb and forming BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO was achieved only very
recently.[17, 18] Superconductivity was observed below 1.2 K,[18] and
the critical temperature could be raised to above 5 K through Na doping
at the Ba site in Ba_(1‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖx)Na_(x)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO.[17] The undoped parent
compound shows a density-wave transition at much lower temperature,
T_(DW) = 54 K, and it was shown that Na doping decreased the critical
temperature even further (while raising the superconducting T_(c)).[17]
The questions about the nature of the superconducting state and whether
or not the density-wave state competes or supports superconductivity are
yet to be explored.

Electronic structure calculations by Singh[19] have shown the existence
of several sheets at the Fermi surface and a nesting property which
induces a magnetic instability (SDW). Related to this instability, a
sign-changing s-wave state was predicted to originate from an
unconventional spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. The coupling
of charges to the magnetic order is observed in a strong
magnetoresistance effect below T_(DW) in BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO,[17] as well as in
BaTi‚ÇÇAs‚ÇÇO.[16] On the other hand, Subedi [20] suggested the
electron-phonon mechanism for superconductivity and a CDW instability in
BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO based on first-principles calculations of the phonon
dispersions and electron-phonon interactions, predicting a multiband
superconducting state, similar to some iron pnictide superconductors.

To distinguish between different proposals about the microscopic origin
of superconductivity in Ba_(1‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖx)Na_(x)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO experimental probes on
the superconducting gap structure need to be employed. The temperature
dependence of the electronic heat capacity ùíû_(el)(T) measured to low
temperatures is a sensitive probe which can reveal unconventional
superconductivity, the existence of nodes in the superconducting gap
function, and the possible presence of multiple gaps (multiband
superconductivity). We have therefore studied the heat capacity of
Ba_(1‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖx)Na_(x)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO in applied magnetic fields and at temperatures
as low as 0.4 K. Our results are consistent with a single-gap weak
coupling BCS-like superconducting state.

## III. Results and Discussion

The superconducting transition for BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO and
Ba_(0.85)Na_(0.15)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO is clearly indicated in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b).
The Ba_(0.85)Na_(0.15)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO superconducting transition is seen in Fig.
1(a), by the diamagnetic signal with onset below 5 K. This transition is
also confirmed through resistivity data, as seen in Fig. 1(b), with the
midpoint of the transition occurring at 5 K. Figure 1(b) also shows
resistivity data for BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO. The superconducting transition is very
sharp and the midpoint of the transition is at 1.2 K. The sharpness of
the transition is an indication of the high purity of the sample, which
is further revealed by a high residual resistance ratio of about 40,
significantly higher than in previous reports.[18, 21]

The heat capacity data of Ba_(0.85)Na_(0.15)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO are shown in Fig. 2.
The superconducting state is completely suppressed in a magnetic field
of 30 kOe.

From the high-field data the

normal-state Sommerfeld constant is obtained as Œ≥_(n)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ13 mJ/(mol K¬≤).
However, it should be noted that this value for Œ≥_(n) is enhanced by the
electron-phonon coupling constant, as discussed below, and the bare
electronic value relating to the density of states is lower.

The electronic heat capacity C_(el)(T) was derived from the data shown
in Fig. 2 by subtracting the lattice contribution determined from the
high-field data. The resulting data for the normalized C_(el)/(Œ≥_(n)T)
are very well described by a weak coupling BCS function, shown as the
dashed line in Fig. 3. The excellent agreement of the data with the BCS
theory is evidence for conventional superconductivity in the pnictide
oxide family of compounds. In addition, we do not find any signature of
a possible multiband superconducting state which would leave the typical
imprint on the low-temperature part of the heat capacity as, for
example, observed in MgB‚ÇÇ[22, 23]. The superconducting gap value is
estimated as 2Œî‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1.3 meV.

The magnetic field dependence of C_(el)(T) is shown in Fig. 4. The upper
critical field H_(c2)(T) is extracted from the shift of T_(c) in
magnetic fields, with T_(c) defined as the midpoint of the sharp
increase of C_(el)(T). H_(c2)(T) is shown in the inset of Fig. 4 and
compared with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory[24] (line).
The zero-temperature limit of the critical field is extrapolated as
H_(c2)(0)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ17 kOe, which results in a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length
of Œæ(0)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ14 nm.

The superconducting transition in the undoped BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO happens at
significantly lower temperature. However, the very broad transition
reported originally[18] provides a challenge for a detailed analysis of
the low-temperature heat capacity. Our samples of BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO were
prepared with special care to reduce any impurity or defect content to a
minimum.[17] As a result, a very sharp resistive transition at
T_(c)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ1.2 K (transition width <0.2 K) and also at T_(DW) was observed
as well as a much sharper heat capacity change at T_(c). The zero-field
normalized electronic heat capacity C_(el)/(Œ≥_(n)T) of BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO is
shown in Fig. 5 as a function of the normalized temperature T/T_(c). In
contrast to the Na-doped compound discussed above, the BCS theory
(dashed line in Fig. 5) does not fit the data well. By varying the
superconducting gap size while maintaining the BCS-like temperature
dependence of the gap (the so-called Œ± model[25]) a much better fit is
obtained with Œ±‚ÄÑ‚âà‚ÄÑ1.4 (solid line in Fig. 5). These data still support a
single-gap s-wave superconductivity with a gap value of 2Œî‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0.3 meV,
consistent with conclusions from recent NMR measurements.[26]
Interestingly, the heat capacity jump at T_(c) is only 0.9 of the
normal-state value, much smaller than 1.43 (BCS theory) or 1.36 (Yajima
_et al.[18]_). This low value may suggest strong correlations, possibly
related to the ordered density-wave phase below T_(DW). The Sommerfeld
coefficient Œ≥_(n)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ10.9 mJ/(mol K¬≤) is about 20

theory.

normal state heat capacity C_(el)/T vs. T¬≤ (30 kOe) data). The
Sommerfeld constant is determined as Œ≥_(n)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ13 mJ/(mol K¬≤).

The heat capacity peak in magnetic fields shows the expected shift to
lower temperatures; however, the upper critical field is very low.
Figure 6 shows heat capacity data for BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO in external fields up to
500 Oe. The upper critical field H_(c2)(T) is shown in the inset of Fig.
6. The extrapolation to zero temperature, using the WHH theory, results
in a very low value of H_(c2)(0)‚ÄÑ‚âà‚ÄÑ800 Oe and a coherence length of
Œæ(0)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ64 nm.

Assuming that the origin of the single-gap superconducting state lies in
the electron-phonon coupling mechanism, as suggested by Subedi,[20] the
coupling constant Œª_(ep) and the bare electronic Sommerfeld constant Œ≥‚ÇÄ
can be estimated from the McMillan formula for Œª_(ep) (Ref. [27]) and
the relation Œ≥_(n)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑŒ≥‚ÇÄ(1‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖŒª_(ep)). With an assumed value of
Œº^(*)‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0.13, the results for x‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0 and x‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0.15 are summarized in Table
1.

The Na doping results in a moderate increase of the density of states
(as derived from the increase of Œ≥‚ÇÄ by about 5

## IV Conclusion

The heat capacity data for BaTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO and Ba_(1‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖx)Na_(x)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO are
best described by a single-gap BCS function in the weak coupling limit.
This provides evidence that the superconductivity in this compound is
most likely of s-wave character, as was also implied from nuclear
magnetic and quadrupole resonance measurements of the undoped
compound.[26] The question of whether the pairing is mediated by phonons
or spin fluctuations is yet unresolved. The key seems to be the
understanding of the nature of the density-wave order below T_(DW).

All theoretical studies so far agree about the nesting feature of the
Fermi surface of Na‚ÇÇTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO (Refs. [14] and [28] and
Ba_(1‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖx)Na_(x)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO (Ref. [19]) which is most likely the origin of
the density-wave order. This order coexists with superconductivity in
Ba_(1‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖx)Na_(x)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO (0‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑx‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ0.33).[17, 18, 26] While this
density-wave order has been observed earlier in different pnictide
oxides like Na‚ÇÇTi‚ÇÇAs‚ÇÇO (T_(DW) = 320 K),[13] Na‚ÇÇTi‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO (T_(DW) = 114
K),[12] and BaTi‚ÇÇAs‚ÇÇO (T_(DW) = 200 K),[16] no superconductivity was
found in these systems and attempts at doping or intercalation have not
been successful.[16] The superconductivity in Ba_(1‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖx)Na_(x)Ti‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇO
appears in the compound with the lowest T_(DW)‚ÄÑ‚â§‚ÄÑ54 K, suggesting that
density-wave and superconducting states are competing with one another.
The decrease of T_(DW) and simultaneous increase of the superconducting
T_(c) upon Na doping[17] support the latter conclusion. Furthermore, the
recently reported superconductivity in the system
BaTi‚ÇÇ(Sb_(1‚ÄÖ‚àí‚ÄÖx)Bi_(x))‚ÇÇO also shows that the substitution of Bi for Sb
results in a suppression of the density-wave phase and an increase of
T_(c).[21, 29] Therefore, it is most likely that the superconducting
state and the density-wave order compete, and superconductivity is
possible only in pnictide oxide compounds with a lower energy scale of
the DW phase. While our results suggest that the superconducting state
is a conventional s-wave state, the nature of the pairing mechanism is
unclear at this time and may be either induced by the electron-phonon
coupling[20] or spin-fluctuation derived.[19] While no conclusion can be
drawn on the pairing mechanism, we also have not found any evidence for
a multiband character of the superconducting state in our heat capacity
data.
