###### Abstract

The Nernst effect was measured in the electron-doped cuprate
superconductor Pr2-x Ce2CuO4 (PCCO) at four concentrations, from
underdoped (x = 0.13) to overdoped (x = 0.17), for a wide range of
temperatures above the critical temperature T_(c). A magnetic field H up
to 15 T was used to reliably access the normal-state quasiparticle
contribution to the Nernst signal $N_{\rm qp}$, which is subtracted from
the total signal N, to obtain the superconducting contribution
$N_{\rm sc}$. As a function of H, $N_{\rm sc}$ peaks at a field H^(⋆)
whose temperature dependence obeys H_(c2)^(⋆)ln (T/T_(c)), as it does in
a conventional superconductor such as Nb2Si2... The doping dependence of
the characteristic field scale H_(c2)^(⋆), shown to be closely related
to the upper critical field H_(c2), tracks the domelike dependence of
T_(c), showing that superconductivity is weakened below the quantum
critical point where the Fermi surface is reconstructed, presumably by
the onset of antiferromagnetic order. Our data at all dopings are
quantitatively consistent with the theory of Gaussian superconducting
fluctuations, eliminating the need to invoke unusual vortexlike
excitations above T_(c), and ruling out phase fluctuations as the
mechanism for the fall of T_(c) with underdoping. We compare the
properties of PCCO with those of hole-doped cuprates and conclude that
the domes of T_(c) and H_(c2) versus doping in the latter materials are
also controlled predominantly by phase competition rather than phase
fluctuations.

## I Introduction

Cuprate superconductors have attracted enormous attention because they
hold the record for the highest critical temperature T_(c), which can be
as high as 164 K, halfway to room temperature [1]. As a function of
doping, T_(c) displays a dome-like dependence, reaching a maximal value
at some optimal doping. A fundamental question is as follows: Why does
T_(c) not continue to rise with underdoping? A long-held scenario is
that the pairing strength (and superconducting gap magnitude) does
continue to rise, but the critical temperature T_(c) for long-range
coherence falls because of increasingly strong fluctuations in the phase
of the superconducting order parameter [2]. So, the underlying strength
of superconductivity would become greater than suggested by the maximal
(optimal) value of T_(c), and finding ways to increase phase rigidity
could further increase the maximal T_(c).

The main experimental support for this phase fluctuation scenario came
from the observation of a sizable Nernst signal above T_(c) in
underdoped cuprates such as La2-x Sr2CuO4 (LSCO) [3, 4]. The Nernst
effect, the transverse thermoelectric response to a magnetic field, is
large in the vortex-liquid state of type-II superconductors, due to the
motion of vortices [5]. Consequently, the observation of a large Nernst
signal well above T_(c) in hole-doped cuprates was attributed to
short-lived vortex excitations above T_(c)[3]. In this picture, Cooper
pairs with a finite gap in their excitation spectrum survive to
temperatures as high as T ≃ 3T_(c). Defining the upper critical field
H_(c2) needed to suppress superconductivity as the field where the
Nernst signal vanishes, H_(c2) was found to increase with underdoping,
and this was taken as evidence of a rising gap [6]. A paradigm was born:
While the superconducting gap and the upper critical field increase with
underdoping, T_(c) decreases due to phase fluctuations.

In recent years, it was shown that the three basic assumptions
underlying this interpretation of the Nernst response in cuprates are
invalid. The first assumption was that the quasiparticle contribution to
the measured Nernst signal $N_{\rm qp}$ is negligible, so that all of
the signal can be attributed to superconducting fluctuations. It has
since become clear that $N_{\rm qp}$ can in fact be large in a variety
of strongly correlated metals [7], including cuprates [8]. For example,
Nernst measurements in YBa2Cu3O4 (YBCO) and HgBa2CuO4+3 (Hg1201) reveal
a large negative $N_{\rm qp}$, easily disentangled from $N_{\rm sc}$
because its sign is opposite to that of the superconducting signal [9,
10, 11, 12, 13]. In these materials, $N_{\rm qp}$ starts to grow below
the pseudogap temperature T^(⋆), and it becomes comparable in magnitude
to $N_{\rm sc}$ at T_(c). In the electron-doped material PCCO, the two
contributions are again readily resolved, even though both are positive
in this case, because $N_{\rm qp}$ exhibits a peak at high temperature
while $N_{\rm sc}$ peaks at T_(c), which is relatively low in this
material [14, 15]. A similar two-peak structure is observed in the
hole-doped material La2-x-y Eu3Sr2CuO4 (Eu-LSCO) [8]. In LSCO, the
material on which the early studies were based, $N_{\rm qp}(T)$ is very
similar to that of Eu-LSCO, but, because T_(c) is higher in LSCO, its
peak now merges with the peak in $N_{\rm sc}(T)$, and hence the two
contributions are more difficult to disentangle [8].

The second assumption is that $N_{\rm sc}(H)$ vanishes above H_(c2).
Nernst measurements on the conventional superconductor Nb2Si2... have
revealed that a superconducting signal can persist to fields as high as
H ≃ 4H_(c2) (and to temperatures as high as T ≃ 30T_(c)) [16, 17]. This
countered the notion that superconducting fluctuations do not exist
above H_(c2). The third assumption was that fluctuations which persist
up to 2-3 T_(c) cannot be the usual Gaussian fluctuations of the
superconducting order parameter, and hence these were attributed to
unusual vortexlike excitations. In 2009, two groups arrived at a
complete theory of Gaussian fluctuations in a dirty two-dimensional (2D)
superconductor, extending earlier work [18] to arbitrary temperatures
and fields [19, 20]. This theory was able to explain in detail and
quantitatively the Nb_(x)Si_(1 − x) data, proving that standard
fluctuations can indeed persist up to T ≫ T_(c) and H ≫ H_(c2).

The failure of these three assumptions and the advent of the new
theoretical framework imposed a complete re-examination of the Nernst
effect in cuprate superconductors. This started with a study of the
hole-doped cuprate Eu-LSCO, in which $N_{\rm sc}(T,H)$ was shown to
behave in the same way as it does in Nb_(x)Si_(1 − x) and to agree with
Gaussian theory [21]. The characteristic field $H_{\rm c2}^{\star}$
extracted directly from the data, which we show here to be approximately
equal to H_(c2), was found to be very low in the underdoped regime. The
authors also reanalyzed the published Nernst data on other hole-doped
cuprates to show that $H_{\rm c2}^{\star}$ in fact decreases with
underdoping [21], in contrast to the prior report of an increasing
H_(c2)[6]. However, because the Eu-LSCO study was limited to dopings on
the underdoped side of the T_(c) dome, it did not allow for the ultimate
test: to compare the nature of superconducting fluctuations on the two
sides of the dome, and see whether there is a fundamental difference, or
not.

In this paper, we report a study of superconducting fluctuations in the
electron-doped cuprate PCCO that extends across the phase diagram,
allowing us to compare both sides of the dome. This cuprate offers a
major advantage in that its critical magnetic field at all dopings is
low enough that fluctuations can be fully suppressed by applying only 15
T, thereby allowing a careful extraction of the underlying quasiparticle
contribution $N_{\rm qp}$. This is essential for a detailed analysis of
$N_{\rm sc}$. We find that $N_{\rm sc}$ obeys Gaussian fluctuation
theory quantitatively, compelling evidence that fluctuations in this
cuprate are not unusual, on either side of the dome.

We extract $H_{\rm c2}^{\star}$ directly from the $N_{\rm sc}$ data and
find that it tracks T_(c) as a function of doping, with
$H_{\rm c2}^{\star}$ and T_(c) both showing a dome that peaks at the
same critical doping. This doping is where the Fermi surface of PCCO is
known to undergo a reconstruction [22], due to the onset of a competing
phase that breaks translational symmetry, presumably antiferromagnetic
order [23]. We conclude that superconductivity in electron-doped
cuprates weakens below optimal doping not because of superconducting
phase fluctuations, but because of phase competition. Comparing with the
properties of hole-doped cuprates, we argue that the same conclusion
applies for hole-doped materials.

## II Previous Work

The Nernst effect in PCCO has been measured previously, on thin films
with 0.13 ≤ x ≤ 0.19[14, 15, 24]. A sizable $N_{\rm sc}$ was detected
above T_(c) in underdoped samples, but _not_ in overdoped samples. As a
result, Gaussian theory was tentatively ruled out and the signal was
attributed to phase fluctuations which go away with overdoping. In our
study, an improved signal-to-noise ratio and a higher magnetic field
allow us to clearly detect $N_{\rm sc}$ in the overdoped regime. We find
that there is in fact no qualitative difference between overdoped and
underdoped behavior. For x ≤ 0.15, our data are consistent with previous
data.

## III Methods

We measured four Pr_(2 − x)Ce_(x)CuO_(4 − x) thin films to cover
underdoped (x = 0.13, 0.14), optimally doped (x = 0.15), and overdoped
(x = 0.17) compositions. The epitaxial thin films with [001] orientation
were grown by pulsed laser deposition on LSAT
[(LaAlO₃)_(0.3)(Sr₂AlTaO₆)_(0.7)] substrates using Cu-rich targets to
eliminate parasitic phases [25]. Typical sample dimensions are 3 × 2 mm,
with a thickness of 3000 A. The Nernst effect was measured using one
heater, one differential thermocouple, and one absolute thermocouple
[26]. We used nonmagnetic type-E thermocouples made of chromel and
constantan wires. Resistivity measurements were performed in a Quantum
Design PPMS. The electrical and thermal currents were applied along the
basal plane of the tetragonal crystal structure, and the magnetic field
was always applied perpendicular to the basal plane, i.e., along the c
axis. The critical temperature T_(c) is defined as the temperature where
the resistivity goes to zero; the values are listed in Table 1.

## IV Results

### Resistivity, T_(c), and $T_{\rm min}$

Figure 1 displays the resistivity data ρ versus T for our four samples
at H = 0 to show the superconducting transition and at H = 15 T to show
the normal-state behavior. The T_(c) values are plotted in Fig. 2. As in
all cuprate superconductors, T_(c) has a characteristic domelike
dependence on doping. Except at x = 0.17, all normal-state resistivity
curves ρ(T) show a minimum, at a temperature $T_{\rm min}$ which
increases with decreasing x. Figure 2 shows the doping evolution of
$T_{\rm min}$, seen to extrapolate to zero at x = 0.16. This is also the
critical doping where the normal-state Fermi surface of PCCO at T → 0 is
known to undergo a reconstruction, detected as a sudden change in the
Hall coefficient R_(H), going from small and positive at x > 0.16 to
large and negative at x ≤ 0.16[22, 27]. This Fermi-surface
reconstruction (FSR) is attributed to a quantum critical point (QCP)
below which some ordered phase sets in, at x_(c) = 0.16 (in the absence
of superconductivity). Measurements of the Hall coefficient R_(H) at
H = 15 T in our own thin films find that in the low temperature limit,
R_(H) > 0 in our sample with x = 0.17 and R_(H) < 0 in our sample with
x = 0.15, confirming that the normal-state QCP at which FSR occurs in
our samples is x_(c) = 0.16 ± 0.01, in excellent agreement with prior
data
