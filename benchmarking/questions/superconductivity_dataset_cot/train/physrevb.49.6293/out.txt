###### Abstract

The electron-doped L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} (L=lanthanide) superconductors have intergrowth structures in which CuO_{2} sheets alternate with L,Ce_{2}O_{2} fluorite layers along the c axis. Stabilization of such intergrowth structures requires bond-length matching between Cu-O and (L,Ce)-O bonds. Any bond-length mismatch will result in the buildup of compressive or tensile stresses in the Cu-O and (L,Ce)-O bonds. The consequences of such internal stresses in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} are investigated by a systematic variation through L^{3+} size of the lattice parameter a. A decrease in the degree of bond-length mismatch or internal stresses with decreasing L^{3+} size causes a systematic decrease in the Ce solubility limit and in the case with which oxygen vacancies can be created. The concentration of oxygen vacancies decreases--or the oxygen content increases--with decreasing L^{3+} size for a given N_{2}-annealing temperature and Ce content; it also decreases with increasing Ce content for a given L^{3+} ion. The decreasing oxygen-vacancy concentration with decreasing size of L^{3+} causes an apparent increase in the critical Ce concentration x_{e} required to induce the antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor transition as the size of L^{3+} decreases, although the transition seems to occur at a fixed critical electron concentration n_{e}=0.175\pm 0.005 irrespective of the L^{3+} size.

## I Introduction

Extensive investigation of the copper oxide superconductors during the past few years has led to a recognition of several important crystal-chemical features in these materials. Excepting the infinite-layer compound Sr_{1-x}L_{x}CuO_{2} (L=lanthanide),[1, 2] they all have intergrowth structures in which the superconductivity active CuO_{2} sheets alternate with other, inactive layers along the c axis. For example, a single CuO_{2} sheet alternates with double LaO-LaO rocksalt layers along the c axis in the T structure of La_{2}CuO_{4}. The stabilization of such an intergrowth structure requires bond-length matching across the intergrowth interface.[3, 4] The degree of bond-length matching between the intergrowth layers is expressed generally in terms of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor,

\[t=(r_{\text{La}^{3+}}+r_{\text{O}^{2-}})/\sqrt{2}(r_{\text{Cu}^{2+}}+r_{\text {O}^{2-}})\ ,\] (1)

where r_{\text{La}^{3+}}, r_{\text{Cu}^{2+}} and r_{\text{O}^{2-}} refer to room-temperature ionic radii.[5] A deviation from unity of the value of t produces a bond-length mismatch between the intergrowth layers and results in a buildup of internal stresses in the layers.

A room-temperature tolerance factor t=0.87 in La_{2}CuO_{4} results in a compressive stress in the Cu-O bonds and a tensile stress in the La-O bonds. On the other hand, direct electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged O^{2-} ions of the fluorite L-O_{2}-L layers in the T^{\prime} structure of L_{2}CuO_{4} increases the a lattice parameter, which results in a tensile stress in the Cu-O bonds and a compressive stress in the L-O bonds. The presence of compressive vs tensile stresses in the Cu-O bonds of the T and T^{\prime} structure determines the p- vs n-type doping.[3, 4]

We had shown[6, 7] by investigating the La_{2-x}Nd_{x}CuO_{4} system that the T^{\prime} structure can be stabilized up to a maximum room-temperature tolerance factor t\approx 0.858 (a\approx 3.97 A and Cu-O bond length \approx 1.985 A) at x\approx 1.2, if the samples are synthesized at 1050degC. Lowering of the synthesis temperature to about 500degC extends the stability of the T^{\prime} phase to a higher room-temperature tolerance factor t\approx 0.867 at x\approx 0.4. The shift in the T^{\prime} phase field to higher x values as the synthesis temperature increases is a consequence of the temperature dependence of the tolerance factor. The tolerance factor t increases as the synthesis temperature increases because of a larger thermal expansion of the (La,Nd)-O bonds compared to that of the Cu-O bonds. An increasing t favors the rocksalt arrangement--i.e., the T structure of La_{2}CuO_{4}--as the synthesis temperature increases. For example, for a given value of x=0.5, the T^{\prime} structure is found for a lower synthesis temperature T\leq 600degC while the T structure is encountered for a higher synthesis temperature T\approx 800degC.

Extension of the T^{\prime} phase field to large L =Nd_{1-y}La_{y} allowed us to synthesize electron-doped LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} superconductors.[8] We found, in agreement with Tao _et al._,[9] that the transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor occurs at a smaller x\approx 0.10 in the LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} system compared to that at x\approx 0.14 in Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} as observed by several groups[9, 10, 11] and by us. We attributed this difference at that time to an increasing Madelung energy caused by a decreasing Cu-O bond length as the L^{3+} size decreases. In order to further identify the origin of such an observed difference, we have now systematically investigated several La_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} systems with varying Cu-O bond lengths. We find that the variation with L^{3+} size of internal stresses introduced by bond-length mismatch plays a critical role in determining the Ce solubility, oxygen content, and superconductive properties. We present in this paper the role of bond-length mismatch in the properties of L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}.

## II Experiment

The L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} samples were prepared by a coprecipitation technique [6] in order to ensure homogeneity and a uniform distribution of Ce. Required quantities of predicted L_{2}O_{3}, ceric ammonium nitrate, and Cu metal were dissolved in dilute nitric acid. A solution of potassium carbonate was then added until the pH was raised to 7 to coprecipitate L^{3+}, Ce^{4+}, and Cu^{2+} as carbonates. The coprecipitate was washed with water, dried at 100 degC, and fired in air at 500 degC for 6 h. The resulting black powder was ground, pelletized, and fired at 1000 degC for 24 h. The pellets were ground, repelletized, and refined at 1000 degC for another 24 h. The L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} samples were also synthesized by standard solid-state procedures. Required quantities of L_{2}O_{3}, CeO_{2}, and CuO were fired first at 900 degC for 20 h and then at 1050 degC for 48 h with intermittent grindings. Samples prepared by both techniques gave similar results. In either case the samples after the firing schedule were allowed to cool in the furnace by turning off the power. These samples are designed "as-prepared samples." The as-prepared samples were then annealed at different temperatures in a N_{2} atmosphere; these samples are designated "N_{2}-annealed samples." The N_{2} gas from commercial cylinders was passed through a heated copper column to reduce the amount of residual oxygen.

The products were all characterized by x-ray powder diffraction. Lattice parameters were refined using KCl as an internal standard. The oxygen content was determined by iodometric titration. [12] Superconducting transition temperatures were determined with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with a field of 10 Oe.

## III Results and Discussion

### Cerium solubility

The solubility limits x_{\rm lim} of Ce in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} were determined by x-ray powder diffraction. The value of x at which impurity phases start appearing in the x-ray-diffraction patterns was taken as the solubility limit of Ce. The variation of the Ce solubility limit with the size of L^{3+} ions is shown in Fig. 1. The Ce solubility decreases monotonically with decreasing size of L^{3+}.

The solubility limits x_{\rm lim} = 0.20 and 0.15 found, respectively, for L = Nd and Gd in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} agree well with those already reported in the literature. [13] We have been able to increase the Ce solubility limit to x_{\rm lim} = 0.25 in La_{1.3}Nd_{0.45}Ce_{0.25}CuO_{4} or (La_{0.74}Nd_{0.26})_{1.75}Ce_{0.25}CuO_{4}. This is the maximum Ce solubility that one can achieve in the T^{\prime} structure. The compound La_{1.3}Nd_{0.45}Ce_{0.25}CuO_{4} has the largest a parameter (3.993 A) of all the known T^{\prime} phases, and the corresponding Cu-O bond length of 1.997 A represents the upper limit for the T^{\prime} structure. Any attempt to increase the Ce solubility limit beyond x_{\rm lim} = 0.25 with La content in La_{p}Nd_{2-y-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} results in the formation of impurity phases having the T structure. Also, near these upper limits of T^{\prime} phase field, lowering of Ce content below the solubility limit x_{\rm lim} results in the formation of T phases as impurity. For example, La_{1.3}Nd_{0.45-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} is formed only for a narrow range of 0.20 \leq x \leq 0.25 and LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} for 0.09 \leq x \leq 0.24. Formation of T phases as impurities near the upper T^{\prime} phase field is also apparent in a study [14] of Nd_{1.85-x}La_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4}, in which T-phase impurities are formed for x > 1.2.

We also find that the Ce solubility limit decreases to x_{\rm lim} = 0.10 in GdDy_{0.9}Ce_{0.1}CuO_{4}, or (Gd_{0.53}Dy_{0.47})_{1.9}Ce_{0.10}CuO_{4}. This phase is close to the lower end of the T^{\prime} phase field. The compound Gd_{1.4}Dy_{0.6}CuO_{4}--(Gd_{0.7}Dy_{0.3})_{2}CuO_{4}--has the smallest a parameter (3.888 A) of all the known T^{\prime} phases, and the corresponding Cu-O bond length of 1.944 A represents the lower limit for the T^{\prime} structure. Attempts to increase the Dy content further, or to substitute Ce for (Gd_{1.4}Dy_{0.6}CuO_{4}, result in the formation of L_{2}Cu_{2}O_{5} impurity phases. However, the T^{\prime} phase field can be lowered to smaller L = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Y, if high hydrostatic pressure (6 GPa) is used in the synthesis. [13]

The decreasing solubility limit of Ce with decreasing size of L^{3+} can be explained on the basis of a bond-length matching criterion. As the size of the L^{3+} ion in the T^{\prime}L_{2}CuO_{4} increases, the degree of bond-length mismatch and internal stresses increase. The greater the degree of bond-length mismatch, the larger are the number of antibonding electrons that can be introduced into the CuO_{2} sheets and/or the larger would be the amount of Ce^{4+} that can be substituted for L^{3+}. Therefore, the Ce solubility increases with increasing size of the L^{3+} ion. Gd_{2}CuO_{4} with a smaller a parameter has a relatively lower degree of internal stresses and a Ce doping level of x = 0.15 suffices to relieve the internal stresses. On the other hand, LaNdCuO_{4} with a greater degree of internal stresses requires a Ce doping of x = 0.24 to relieve the internal stresses. Complete relief of internal stresses at

Figure 1: Variation of Ce solubility limit with the size of the L^{3+} ion in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}.

  x = x_{\rm lim} prohibits further doping by Ce beyond the observed solubility limit. It is now clear that the driving force for _n_-type doping in L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4 as well as the extent of doping are primarily determined by the degree of internal stresses introduced by bond-length mismatch.

The narrow range of Ce incorporation in La1,Nd0.45-_x_Ce_xCuO4 (0.20 <= x <= 0.25) and LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4 (0.09 <= x <= 0.24) needs further comment. These phases are near the upper limit of the _T_' phase field. Any increase in _L_-O bond length would increase the tolerance factor t and favor the stabilization of T phases. Lowering of Ce content to x < 0.20 in La1,Nd0.45-_x_Ce_xCuO4 or x < 0.09 in LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4 increases the average (_L_,Ce)-O bond length in the (_L_,Ce)2O2 layer and renders the _T_' structure unstable.

### Oxygen content

The as-prepared samples of L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4+-8 all have d = 0.02 excess oxygen. The excess d oxygen occupy the empty octahedral positions of the L2-_x_Ce_xO2 fluorite layer--i.e, the (0.5,0.5,0.3523) sites in the I4/_mmm_ space group of the _T_' structure--and create randomly five-coordinated Cu. A nonuniform oxygen coordination perturbs the periodic potential of the CuO2 sheets and causes a trapping of the carriers within the mobility edge, which gives rise to semiconducting behavior.[16] Therefore, annealing of L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4+-8 in N2 atmosphere at higher temperatures is essential to remove the excess interstitial oxygen atoms and to induce superconductivity. However, there appears to be an equilibrium between the oxygen atoms occupying the normal tetrahedral sites and the interstitial octahedral sites, which necessitates creation of a small, but sufficient, number of oxygen vacancies in the tetrahedral sites before all the interstitial oxygen atoms can be removed.[17] We find from careful iodometric titration on a number of samples that an oxygen-vacancy concentration d >= 0.01 in L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 is necessary to remove all the interstitial oxygen atoms and induce superconductivity with a strong Meissner signal. We ascertain, as has been broadly suggested in the literature,[18,19] that creation of oxygen vacancies in L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 is an essential factor to achieve superconductivity.

We find that the oxygen content generally decreases with increasing N2-annealing temperature as one would expect. For a constant N2-annealing temperature, the total oxygen content increases with increasing cerium content (Fig. 2). The results shown in Fig. 2 for the system LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 are obtained after annealing at a constant temperature of 950 degC in N2. An oxygen-vacancy concentration d = 0.03 is found for x = 0.09 whereas d = 0.00 is found for x = 0.22. It becomes increasingly difficult to create oxygen vacancies as the cerium content increases; no oxygen vacancies are found near the Ce solubility limit. This finding has important consequences, as we show in the next section; to our knowledge, this effect has not been established in the literature. We believe that the lack of such information is due to the decreasing solubility of L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 in a mixture of KI and HCl during the iodometric analysis as the L3+ size decreases. The decreasing basicity of smaller L 3+ ions appears to decrease the dissolution; similar results are found in several other systems.[20] The difficulties in sample dissolution as well as the limited Ce solubility for smaller L = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu might have hindered the observation of a small, but systematic, variation of oxygen content with cerium content. With the larger L = (La,Nd) in LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8, we could precisely determine the oxygen content and notice clearly the variation of oxygen content with Ce content.

The monotonic increase in oxygen content, or decrease in oxygen vacancies, with increasing Ce content can be explained on the basis of the degree of internal stresses introduced by bond-length mismatch. Creation of oxygen vacancies in L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 introduces antibonding electrons into the CuO2 sheets, which can relieve the tensile stress in the Cu-O bonds. Also, oxygen vacancies in the (_L_,Ce)2O2-8 fluorite layer can reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the O2- ions and the compressive stress in the (_L_, Ce)-O bonds. The decreasing degree of internal stresses with increasing Ce content results in a decreasing driving force for the acceptance of antibonding electrons and oxygen-vacancy concentration. Close to the solubility limit x = 0.24 in LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4, the internal stresses have nearly been relieved and it becomes difficult to create any oxygen vacancies. Also, the increasing concentration of Cu+ with Ce content makes it increasingly difficult to create additional Cu+ via the creation of oxygen vacancies, because Cu+ generally prefers linear or tetrahedral oxygen coordination; thus it is somewhat difficult to keep large concentrations of Cu+ in square-coplanar oxygen coordination.

The synthesis of Nd2-_y_-_x_La_y_Ce_xCuO4 for 0 <= y <= 1.0 has also enabled us to monitor the variation of oxygen content with the size of L3+ for a fixed Ce content and a given N2-annealing temperature. The variation of oxygen content with L3+ size or with the a parameter is shown in Fig. 3 for Nd2-_y_ - 0.12 La3 Ce0.12CuO4 (0 <= y <= 1.0). These samples with a fixed Ce content x = 0.12 were all annealed in N2 at 950 degC and were analyzed for oxygen content. We find a small, but steady, increase in the total oxygen content, or a decrease in the oxygen vacancies, as

Figure 2: Variation of oxygen content in LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4 with x for a constant annealing temperature of 950 °C in N2 atmosphere.

  the average size of L^{\,3+} decreases. To our knowledge this systematic variation has not been described in the literature; we show in the next section the consequences of such a variation.

The decreasing oxygen-vacancy concentration with decreasing size of L^{\,3+} for a fixed Ce concentration is again due to the decreasing degree of bond-length mismatch. Similar arguments have also been made[21] to account for the decreasing degree of self-doping with decreasing L^{\,3+} size in the undoped L_{2}CuO_{4-\delta} oxides. In addition, the less basic, smaller L^{\,3+} ions become more strongly bound to the oxygen atoms, with an increase in covalent character. A stronger bonding between the smaller L^{\,3+} and O^{2-} ions can make the removal of oxygen atoms from the tetrahedral sites of the L_{2}O_{2} fluorite layers difficult.

### Carrier concentration and superconductivity

The variation of T_{c} with Ce content x is shown in Fig. 4 for LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} and Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}. Samples with compositions in the shaded regions exhibited a much reduced Meissner signal and consist of two-phase regions of the antiferromagnetic semiconductor and superconducting phases. The value of x at which superconductivity begins with a maximum Meissner signal is designated as the critical value x_{c} of Ce concentration required for a transition from the antiferromagnetic semiconductor to the superconductor; for x\geq x_{c}, the Meissner signal remains nearly constant for all the superconductive compositions. We notice from Fig. 4 that the value of x_{c} increases from 0.10 in LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} to 0.13 in Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}. This difference is significant and could be attributed[8] to an increasing Madelung energy caused by a decreasing a parameter on going from LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} to Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}. The decreasing a parameter reduces the Cu-O bond length and can increase the Madelung energy, which is inversely proportional to the Cu-O distance. An increasing Madelung energy can raise the Cu 3d energies and increase the charge-transfer gap \Delta between the Cu 3d and O 2p bands.[22] In fact, from optical measurements the charge-transfer gap \Delta has been shown[23] experimentally to increase monotonically on passing from L= Pr to L= Gd. An increasing \Delta will reduce the covalent mixing parameter

\[\lambda=b^{\,\rm ca}/\Delta\ ,\] (2)

where b^{\,\rm ca} is the cation-anion resonance integral; this can necessitate a higher level of doping for superconductivity to occur. We proposed this interpretation previously,[8] based on the assumption that the oxygen content for a given N_{2}-annealing temperature remains constant for all concentrations x of cerium, irrespective of the size of the L^{\,3+} ions. Our present assertion is that the oxygen con

The shaded area represents a two-phase region between the antiferromagnetic semiconductor and the superconductor regions. For the sake of comparison, the abscissa has been maintained from x=0.0 to x=0.25 in both the systems, but the phases are formed only for 0.09\leq x\leq 0.24 in LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} and 0\leq x\leq 0.20 in Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}.

  tent is variable, depending on the size of L^{3+} and the Ce content; this made us reexamine our position.

We prepared several samples in the L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} system for L\!=\!Nd_{1-y}La_{y}, Nd, Sm, and Gd. The critical value x_{c} is plotted against the experimentally observed a parameter and the L^{3+} size in Fig. 5. The value of x_{c} increases with decreasing size of the L^{3+} ion as one would expect, based on our previous results[8] with LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-8} and Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-8}. However, the critical electron concentration n_{c} in the CuO_{2} sheets required to induce a transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor seems to remain nearly constant at n_{c}\!=\!0.175\!\pm\!0.005 for all L^{3+} ion sizes or a parameters (Fig. 6). The n_{c} values were calculated from the experimentally observed oxygen content, assuming L^{3+}, Ce^{4+}, and O^{2-} valences in the solid L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-8} samples. The experimental error in the determination of oxygen is \pm 0.005 and the corresponding experimental error in n_{c} is \pm 0.01. The observed n_{c} values in Fig. 6 remain constant within this experimental error bar. The n_{c} value for smaller L=Sm is not included in Fig. 6 because of the possible error in the oxygen content, which arises from the decreasing solubility during iodometric titration, and formation of impurity phases during N_{2}-annealing. A decreasing degree of tensile stress in the Cu-O bonds with decreasing size of L^{3+} ions makes it increasingly difficult to create and sustain oxygen vacancies; thus, the samples with smaller L^{3+} ions tend to decompose during N_{2} annealing. This problem becomes severe with the still smaller L=Gd, and the Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} samples decompose rapidly to give Cu_{2}O, as indicated by a color change from black to brown.

It is clear from our present data that the transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} occurs at a nearly fixed electron concentration n_{c}\!=\!0.175\!\pm\!0.005, irrespective of the size of L^{3+} ions or the a parameter. The apparent increase in the value of x_{c} with decreasing L^{3+} ion size is due to the decreasing number of oxygen vacancies with the decreasing size of the L^{3+} ion. We conclude that the influence of Madelung energy or charge-transfer gap \Delta is less significant in determining the critical amount of doping necessary to induce a transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor.

The present data also can explain why one does not observe superconductivity in Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} at x\!=\!0.15. The smaller Gd^{3+} ion limits the Ce solubility to x_{\rm lim}\!=\!0.15 (Fig. 1). The electron concentration n\!=\!0.15 at x_{\rm lim}\!=\!0.15, assuming an oxygen content of 4.00, is much less than the n_{c} value of 0.175\pm0.005 required to induce superconductivity. Although n can further be increased in other systems with larger L^{3+} ions via the creation of oxygen vacancies, such a mechanism does not seem to work with the smaller L=Gd. A stronger bonding between smaller Gd^{3+} and O^{2-} ions, and a nearly complete relief of the internal stresses near the Ce solubil

## IV Conclusion

The internal stresses introduced by a bond-length mismatch between the (L,Ce)-O and Cu-O bonds have important influences on the crystal chemistry, chemical composition, and properties of L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}. The consequences of the internal stresses have been investigated systematically by varying the size of the L^{\,3+} ions. The results are summarized below.

(1) The Ce solubility limit decreases with decreasing size of L^{\,3+} ions.

(2) The oxygen content increases, or the oxygen-vacancy concentration decreases, with decreasing size of L^{\,3+} ion for a given N_{2}-annealing temperature and Ce content. For a given L^{\,3+} ion and N_{2}-annealing temperature, the oxygen content increases with increasing Ce content.

(3) The transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} seems to occur at a nearly fixed critical electron concentration n_{c}=0.175\pm 0.005. However, a decreasing concentration of oxygen vacancies with decreasing size of L^{\,3+} causes an increase in the critical Ce concentration x_{c} required to induce the transition.

The electron-doped L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} (L=lanthanide) superconductors have intergrowth structures in which CuO_{2} sheets alternate with L,Ce_{2}O_{2} fluorite layers along the c axis. Stabilization of such intergrowth structures requires bond-length matching between Cu-O and (L,Ce)-O bonds. Any bond-length mismatch will result in the buildup of compressive or tensile stresses in the Cu-O and (L,Ce)-O bonds. The consequences of such internal stresses in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} are investigated by a systematic variation through L^{3+} size of the lattice parameter a. A decrease in the degree of bond-length mismatch or internal stresses with decreasing L^{3+} size causes a systematic decrease in the Ce solubility limit and in the case with which oxygen vacancies can be created. The concentration of oxygen vacancies decreases--or the oxygen content increases--with decreasing L^{3+} size for a given N_{2}-annealing temperature and Ce content; it also decreases with increasing Ce content for a given L^{3+} ion. The decreasing oxygen-vacancy concentration with decreasing size of L^{3+} causes an apparent increase in the critical Ce concentration x_{e} required to induce the antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor transition as the size of L^{3+} decreases, although the transition seems to occur at a fixed critical electron concentration n_{e}=0.175\pm 0.005 irrespective of the L^{3+} size.

## I Introduction

Extensive investigation of the copper oxide superconductors during the past few years has led to a recognition of several important crystal-chemical features in these materials. Excepting the infinite-layer compound Sr_{1-x}L_{x}CuO_{2} (L=lanthanide),[1, 2] they all have intergrowth structures in which the superconductivity active CuO_{2} sheets alternate with other, inactive layers along the c axis. For example, a single CuO_{2} sheet alternates with double LaO-LaO rocksalt layers along the c axis in the T structure of La_{2}CuO_{4}. The stabilization of such an intergrowth structure requires bond-length matching across the intergrowth interface.[3, 4] The degree of bond-length matching between the intergrowth layers is expressed generally in terms of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor,

\[t=(r_{\text{La}^{3+}}+r_{\text{O}^{2-}})/\sqrt{2}(r_{\text{Cu}^{2+}}+r_{\text {O}^{2-}})\ ,\] (1)

where r_{\text{La}^{3+}}, r_{\text{Cu}^{2+}} and r_{\text{O}^{2-}} refer to room-temperature ionic radii.[5] A deviation from unity of the value of t produces a bond-length mismatch between the intergrowth layers and results in a buildup of internal stresses in the layers.

A room-temperature tolerance factor t=0.87 in La_{2}CuO_{4} results in a compressive stress in the Cu-O bonds and a tensile stress in the La-O bonds. On the other hand, direct electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged O^{2-} ions of the fluorite L-O_{2}-L layers in the T^{\prime} structure of L_{2}CuO_{4} increases the a lattice parameter, which results in a tensile stress in the Cu-O bonds and a compressive stress in the L-O bonds. The presence of compressive vs tensile stresses in the Cu-O bonds of the T and T^{\prime} structure determines the p- vs n-type doping.[3, 4]

We had shown[6, 7] by investigating the La_{2-x}Nd_{x}CuO_{4} system that the T^{\prime} structure can be stabilized up to a maximum room-temperature tolerance factor t\approx 0.858 (a\approx 3.97 A and Cu-O bond length \approx 1.985 A) at x\approx 1.2, if the samples are synthesized at 1050degC. Lowering of the synthesis temperature to about 500degC extends the stability of the T^{\prime} phase to a higher room-temperature tolerance factor t\approx 0.867 at x\approx 0.4. The shift in the T^{\prime} phase field to higher x values as the synthesis temperature increases is a consequence of the temperature dependence of the tolerance factor. The tolerance factor t increases as the synthesis temperature increases because of a larger thermal expansion of the (La,Nd)-O bonds compared to that of the Cu-O bonds. An increasing t favors the rocksalt arrangement--i.e., the T structure of La_{2}CuO_{4}--as the synthesis temperature increases. For example, for a given value of x=0.5, the T^{\prime} structure is found for a lower synthesis temperature T\leq 600degC while the T structure is encountered for a higher synthesis temperature T\approx 800degC.

Extension of the T^{\prime} phase field to large L =Nd_{1-y}La_{y} allowed us to synthesize electron-doped LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} superconductors.[8] We found, in agreement with Tao _et al._,[9] that the transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor occurs at a smaller x\approx 0.10 in the LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} system compared to that at x\approx 0.14 in Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} as observed by several groups[9, 10, 11] and by us. We attributed this difference at that time to an increasing Madelung energy caused by a decreasing Cu-O bond length as the L^{3+} size decreases. In order to further identify the origin of such an observed difference, we have now systematically investigated several La_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} systems with varying Cu-O bond lengths. We find that the variation with L^{3+} size of internal stresses introduced by bond-length mismatch plays a critical role in determining the Ce solubility, oxygen content, and superconductive properties. We present in this paper the role of bond-length mismatch in the properties of L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}.

## II Experiment

The L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} samples were prepared by a coprecipitation technique [6] in order to ensure homogeneity and a uniform distribution of Ce. Required quantities of predicted L_{2}O_{3}, ceric ammonium nitrate, and Cu metal were dissolved in dilute nitric acid. A solution of potassium carbonate was then added until the pH was raised to 7 to coprecipitate L^{3+}, Ce^{4+}, and Cu^{2+} as carbonates. The coprecipitate was washed with water, dried at 100 degC, and fired in air at 500 degC for 6 h. The resulting black powder was ground, pelletized, and fired at 1000 degC for 24 h. The pellets were ground, repelletized, and refined at 1000 degC for another 24 h. The L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} samples were also synthesized by standard solid-state procedures. Required quantities of L_{2}O_{3}, CeO_{2}, and CuO were fired first at 900 degC for 20 h and then at 1050 degC for 48 h with intermittent grindings. Samples prepared by both techniques gave similar results. In either case the samples after the firing schedule were allowed to cool in the furnace by turning off the power. These samples are designed "as-prepared samples." The as-prepared samples were then annealed at different temperatures in a N_{2} atmosphere; these samples are designated "N_{2}-annealed samples." The N_{2} gas from commercial cylinders was passed through a heated copper column to reduce the amount of residual oxygen.

The products were all characterized by x-ray powder diffraction. Lattice parameters were refined using KCl as an internal standard. The oxygen content was determined by iodometric titration. [12] Superconducting transition temperatures were determined with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with a field of 10 Oe.

## III Results and Discussion

### Cerium solubility

The solubility limits x_{\rm lim} of Ce in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} were determined by x-ray powder diffraction. The value of x at which impurity phases start appearing in the x-ray-diffraction patterns was taken as the solubility limit of Ce. The variation of the Ce solubility limit with the size of L^{3+} ions is shown in Fig. 1. The Ce solubility decreases monotonically with decreasing size of L^{3+}.

The solubility limits x_{\rm lim} = 0.20 and 0.15 found, respectively, for L = Nd and Gd in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} agree well with those already reported in the literature. [13] We have been able to increase the Ce solubility limit to x_{\rm lim} = 0.25 in La_{1.3}Nd_{0.45}Ce_{0.25}CuO_{4} or (La_{0.74}Nd_{0.26})_{1.75}Ce_{0.25}CuO_{4}. This is the maximum Ce solubility that one can achieve in the T^{\prime} structure. The compound La_{1.3}Nd_{0.45}Ce_{0.25}CuO_{4} has the largest a parameter (3.993 A) of all the known T^{\prime} phases, and the corresponding Cu-O bond length of 1.997 A represents the upper limit for the T^{\prime} structure. Any attempt to increase the Ce solubility limit beyond x_{\rm lim} = 0.25 with La content in La_{p}Nd_{2-y-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} results in the formation of impurity phases having the T structure. Also, near these upper limits of T^{\prime} phase field, lowering of Ce content below the solubility limit x_{\rm lim} results in the formation of T phases as impurity. For example, La_{1.3}Nd_{0.45-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} is formed only for a narrow range of 0.20 \leq x \leq 0.25 and LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} for 0.09 \leq x \leq 0.24. Formation of T phases as impurities near the upper T^{\prime} phase field is also apparent in a study [14] of Nd_{1.85-x}La_{x}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4}, in which T-phase impurities are formed for x > 1.2.

We also find that the Ce solubility limit decreases to x_{\rm lim} = 0.10 in GdDy_{0.9}Ce_{0.1}CuO_{4}, or (Gd_{0.53}Dy_{0.47})_{1.9}Ce_{0.10}CuO_{4}. This phase is close to the lower end of the T^{\prime} phase field. The compound Gd_{1.4}Dy_{0.6}CuO_{4}--(Gd_{0.7}Dy_{0.3})_{2}CuO_{4}--has the smallest a parameter (3.888 A) of all the known T^{\prime} phases, and the corresponding Cu-O bond length of 1.944 A represents the lower limit for the T^{\prime} structure. Attempts to increase the Dy content further, or to substitute Ce for (Gd_{1.4}Dy_{0.6}CuO_{4}, result in the formation of L_{2}Cu_{2}O_{5} impurity phases. However, the T^{\prime} phase field can be lowered to smaller L = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Y, if high hydrostatic pressure (6 GPa) is used in the synthesis. [13]

The decreasing solubility limit of Ce with decreasing size of L^{3+} can be explained on the basis of a bond-length matching criterion. As the size of the L^{3+} ion in the T^{\prime}L_{2}CuO_{4} increases, the degree of bond-length mismatch and internal stresses increase. The greater the degree of bond-length mismatch, the larger are the number of antibonding electrons that can be introduced into the CuO_{2} sheets and/or the larger would be the amount of Ce^{4+} that can be substituted for L^{3+}. Therefore, the Ce solubility increases with increasing size of the L^{3+} ion. Gd_{2}CuO_{4} with a smaller a parameter has a relatively lower degree of internal stresses and a Ce doping level of x = 0.15 suffices to relieve the internal stresses. On the other hand, LaNdCuO_{4} with a greater degree of internal stresses requires a Ce doping of x = 0.24 to relieve the internal stresses. Complete relief of internal stresses at

Figure 1: Variation of Ce solubility limit with the size of the L^{3+} ion in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}.

  x = x_{\rm lim} prohibits further doping by Ce beyond the observed solubility limit. It is now clear that the driving force for _n_-type doping in L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4 as well as the extent of doping are primarily determined by the degree of internal stresses introduced by bond-length mismatch.

The narrow range of Ce incorporation in La1,Nd0.45-_x_Ce_xCuO4 (0.20 <= x <= 0.25) and LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4 (0.09 <= x <= 0.24) needs further comment. These phases are near the upper limit of the _T_' phase field. Any increase in _L_-O bond length would increase the tolerance factor t and favor the stabilization of T phases. Lowering of Ce content to x < 0.20 in La1,Nd0.45-_x_Ce_xCuO4 or x < 0.09 in LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4 increases the average (_L_,Ce)-O bond length in the (_L_,Ce)2O2 layer and renders the _T_' structure unstable.

### Oxygen content

The as-prepared samples of L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4+-8 all have d = 0.02 excess oxygen. The excess d oxygen occupy the empty octahedral positions of the L2-_x_Ce_xO2 fluorite layer--i.e, the (0.5,0.5,0.3523) sites in the I4/_mmm_ space group of the _T_' structure--and create randomly five-coordinated Cu. A nonuniform oxygen coordination perturbs the periodic potential of the CuO2 sheets and causes a trapping of the carriers within the mobility edge, which gives rise to semiconducting behavior.[16] Therefore, annealing of L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4+-8 in N2 atmosphere at higher temperatures is essential to remove the excess interstitial oxygen atoms and to induce superconductivity. However, there appears to be an equilibrium between the oxygen atoms occupying the normal tetrahedral sites and the interstitial octahedral sites, which necessitates creation of a small, but sufficient, number of oxygen vacancies in the tetrahedral sites before all the interstitial oxygen atoms can be removed.[17] We find from careful iodometric titration on a number of samples that an oxygen-vacancy concentration d >= 0.01 in L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 is necessary to remove all the interstitial oxygen atoms and induce superconductivity with a strong Meissner signal. We ascertain, as has been broadly suggested in the literature,[18,19] that creation of oxygen vacancies in L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 is an essential factor to achieve superconductivity.

We find that the oxygen content generally decreases with increasing N2-annealing temperature as one would expect. For a constant N2-annealing temperature, the total oxygen content increases with increasing cerium content (Fig. 2). The results shown in Fig. 2 for the system LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 are obtained after annealing at a constant temperature of 950 degC in N2. An oxygen-vacancy concentration d = 0.03 is found for x = 0.09 whereas d = 0.00 is found for x = 0.22. It becomes increasingly difficult to create oxygen vacancies as the cerium content increases; no oxygen vacancies are found near the Ce solubility limit. This finding has important consequences, as we show in the next section; to our knowledge, this effect has not been established in the literature. We believe that the lack of such information is due to the decreasing solubility of L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 in a mixture of KI and HCl during the iodometric analysis as the L3+ size decreases. The decreasing basicity of smaller L 3+ ions appears to decrease the dissolution; similar results are found in several other systems.[20] The difficulties in sample dissolution as well as the limited Ce solubility for smaller L = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu might have hindered the observation of a small, but systematic, variation of oxygen content with cerium content. With the larger L = (La,Nd) in LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8, we could precisely determine the oxygen content and notice clearly the variation of oxygen content with Ce content.

The monotonic increase in oxygen content, or decrease in oxygen vacancies, with increasing Ce content can be explained on the basis of the degree of internal stresses introduced by bond-length mismatch. Creation of oxygen vacancies in L2-_x_Ce_xCuO4-8 introduces antibonding electrons into the CuO2 sheets, which can relieve the tensile stress in the Cu-O bonds. Also, oxygen vacancies in the (_L_,Ce)2O2-8 fluorite layer can reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the O2- ions and the compressive stress in the (_L_, Ce)-O bonds. The decreasing degree of internal stresses with increasing Ce content results in a decreasing driving force for the acceptance of antibonding electrons and oxygen-vacancy concentration. Close to the solubility limit x = 0.24 in LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4, the internal stresses have nearly been relieved and it becomes difficult to create any oxygen vacancies. Also, the increasing concentration of Cu+ with Ce content makes it increasingly difficult to create additional Cu+ via the creation of oxygen vacancies, because Cu+ generally prefers linear or tetrahedral oxygen coordination; thus it is somewhat difficult to keep large concentrations of Cu+ in square-coplanar oxygen coordination.

The synthesis of Nd2-_y_-_x_La_y_Ce_xCuO4 for 0 <= y <= 1.0 has also enabled us to monitor the variation of oxygen content with the size of L3+ for a fixed Ce content and a given N2-annealing temperature. The variation of oxygen content with L3+ size or with the a parameter is shown in Fig. 3 for Nd2-_y_ - 0.12 La3 Ce0.12CuO4 (0 <= y <= 1.0). These samples with a fixed Ce content x = 0.12 were all annealed in N2 at 950 degC and were analyzed for oxygen content. We find a small, but steady, increase in the total oxygen content, or a decrease in the oxygen vacancies, as

Figure 2: Variation of oxygen content in LaNd1-_x_Ce_xCuO4 with x for a constant annealing temperature of 950 °C in N2 atmosphere.

  the average size of L^{\,3+} decreases. To our knowledge this systematic variation has not been described in the literature; we show in the next section the consequences of such a variation.

The decreasing oxygen-vacancy concentration with decreasing size of L^{\,3+} for a fixed Ce concentration is again due to the decreasing degree of bond-length mismatch. Similar arguments have also been made[21] to account for the decreasing degree of self-doping with decreasing L^{\,3+} size in the undoped L_{2}CuO_{4-\delta} oxides. In addition, the less basic, smaller L^{\,3+} ions become more strongly bound to the oxygen atoms, with an increase in covalent character. A stronger bonding between the smaller L^{\,3+} and O^{2-} ions can make the removal of oxygen atoms from the tetrahedral sites of the L_{2}O_{2} fluorite layers difficult.

### Carrier concentration and superconductivity

The variation of T_{c} with Ce content x is shown in Fig. 4 for LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} and Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}. Samples with compositions in the shaded regions exhibited a much reduced Meissner signal and consist of two-phase regions of the antiferromagnetic semiconductor and superconducting phases. The value of x at which superconductivity begins with a maximum Meissner signal is designated as the critical value x_{c} of Ce concentration required for a transition from the antiferromagnetic semiconductor to the superconductor; for x\geq x_{c}, the Meissner signal remains nearly constant for all the superconductive compositions. We notice from Fig. 4 that the value of x_{c} increases from 0.10 in LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} to 0.13 in Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}. This difference is significant and could be attributed[8] to an increasing Madelung energy caused by a decreasing a parameter on going from LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta} to Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}. The decreasing a parameter reduces the Cu-O bond length and can increase the Madelung energy, which is inversely proportional to the Cu-O distance. An increasing Madelung energy can raise the Cu 3d energies and increase the charge-transfer gap \Delta between the Cu 3d and O 2p bands.[22] In fact, from optical measurements the charge-transfer gap \Delta has been shown[23] experimentally to increase monotonically on passing from L= Pr to L= Gd. An increasing \Delta will reduce the covalent mixing parameter

\[\lambda=b^{\,\rm ca}/\Delta\ ,\] (2)

where b^{\,\rm ca} is the cation-anion resonance integral; this can necessitate a higher level of doping for superconductivity to occur. We proposed this interpretation previously,[8] based on the assumption that the oxygen content for a given N_{2}-annealing temperature remains constant for all concentrations x of cerium, irrespective of the size of the L^{\,3+} ions. Our present assertion is that the oxygen con

The shaded area represents a two-phase region between the antiferromagnetic semiconductor and the superconductor regions. For the sake of comparison, the abscissa has been maintained from x=0.0 to x=0.25 in both the systems, but the phases are formed only for 0.09\leq x\leq 0.24 in LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} and 0\leq x\leq 0.20 in Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}.

  tent is variable, depending on the size of L^{3+} and the Ce content; this made us reexamine our position.

We prepared several samples in the L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} system for L\!=\!Nd_{1-y}La_{y}, Nd, Sm, and Gd. The critical value x_{c} is plotted against the experimentally observed a parameter and the L^{3+} size in Fig. 5. The value of x_{c} increases with decreasing size of the L^{3+} ion as one would expect, based on our previous results[8] with LaNd_{1-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-8} and Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-8}. However, the critical electron concentration n_{c} in the CuO_{2} sheets required to induce a transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor seems to remain nearly constant at n_{c}\!=\!0.175\!\pm\!0.005 for all L^{3+} ion sizes or a parameters (Fig. 6). The n_{c} values were calculated from the experimentally observed oxygen content, assuming L^{3+}, Ce^{4+}, and O^{2-} valences in the solid L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-8} samples. The experimental error in the determination of oxygen is \pm 0.005 and the corresponding experimental error in n_{c} is \pm 0.01. The observed n_{c} values in Fig. 6 remain constant within this experimental error bar. The n_{c} value for smaller L=Sm is not included in Fig. 6 because of the possible error in the oxygen content, which arises from the decreasing solubility during iodometric titration, and formation of impurity phases during N_{2}-annealing. A decreasing degree of tensile stress in the Cu-O bonds with decreasing size of L^{3+} ions makes it increasingly difficult to create and sustain oxygen vacancies; thus, the samples with smaller L^{3+} ions tend to decompose during N_{2} annealing. This problem becomes severe with the still smaller L=Gd, and the Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} samples decompose rapidly to give Cu_{2}O, as indicated by a color change from black to brown.

It is clear from our present data that the transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} occurs at a nearly fixed electron concentration n_{c}\!=\!0.175\!\pm\!0.005, irrespective of the size of L^{3+} ions or the a parameter. The apparent increase in the value of x_{c} with decreasing L^{3+} ion size is due to the decreasing number of oxygen vacancies with the decreasing size of the L^{3+} ion. We conclude that the influence of Madelung energy or charge-transfer gap \Delta is less significant in determining the critical amount of doping necessary to induce a transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor.

The present data also can explain why one does not observe superconductivity in Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} at x\!=\!0.15. The smaller Gd^{3+} ion limits the Ce solubility to x_{\rm lim}\!=\!0.15 (Fig. 1). The electron concentration n\!=\!0.15 at x_{\rm lim}\!=\!0.15, assuming an oxygen content of 4.00, is much less than the n_{c} value of 0.175\pm0.005 required to induce superconductivity. Although n can further be increased in other systems with larger L^{3+} ions via the creation of oxygen vacancies, such a mechanism does not seem to work with the smaller L=Gd. A stronger bonding between smaller Gd^{3+} and O^{2-} ions, and a nearly complete relief of the internal stresses near the Ce solubil

## IV Conclusion

The internal stresses introduced by a bond-length mismatch between the (L,Ce)-O and Cu-O bonds have important influences on the crystal chemistry, chemical composition, and properties of L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}. The consequences of the internal stresses have been investigated systematically by varying the size of the L^{\,3+} ions. The results are summarized below.

(1) The Ce solubility limit decreases with decreasing size of L^{\,3+} ions.

(2) The oxygen content increases, or the oxygen-vacancy concentration decreases, with decreasing size of L^{\,3+} ion for a given N_{2}-annealing temperature and Ce content. For a given L^{\,3+} ion and N_{2}-annealing temperature, the oxygen content increases with increasing Ce content.

(3) The transition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to superconductor in L_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} seems to occur at a nearly fixed critical electron concentration n_{c}=0.175\pm 0.005. However, a decreasing concentration of oxygen vacancies with decreasing size of L^{\,3+} causes an increase in the critical Ce concentration x_{c} required to induce the transition.
