###### Abstract

Superconducting EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂ single crystals are
investigated by broad-band infrared spectroscopy. Below T_(c) = 28 K, a
superconducting gap forms at Δ₀ = 9.5 meV = 3.7δ_(B)T_(c), causing the
reflectivity to sharply rise to unity at low frequency. In the range of
the gap, the optical conductivity can be perfectly described by BCS
theory with an s-wave gap and no nodes. From our analysis of the
temperature-dependent conductivity and spectral weight at T > T_(c), we
deduce an increased _interband_ coupling between hole and electron
sheets on the Fermi surface when T approaches T_(c).

From the intense study of iron pnictides over the last years, two main
facts became clear. (1) Optimum superconductivity is reached when
long-range magnetic order and structural transition are completely
suppressed by doping or pressure; magnetic excitations are superior
constituents to superconductivity, (2) Multiband models are needed to
describe the low-energy electronic excitations in pnictides and to
account for the complexity and interplay of magnetic and superconducting
orders; both intraband and interband interactions play important
roles.[1, 2] To clarify the possible mechanisms, it is important to
investigate the electrodynamics of charge carriers in compounds with
altered Fermi-surface environment.

The isovalent-substituted MFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ system (M = Ba, Eu, Sr)
is an ideal candidate for this purpose because the
chemical-pressure-induced superconductivity has a transition temperature
as high as obtained by carrier doping.[3, 4] Band structure calculations
show that P substitution significantly changes the shape of the hole
sheets at Γ point and, finally, one of the three hole sheets is absent
in BaFe₂P₂.[5, 6] Carrier doping (for example, hole-doped
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂), on the other hand, mainly affects the size of
the sheets, although it influences the Fermi-surface (FS) reconstruction
as well.[7, 8, 9] The isovalent substitution of As by P keeps the
balance between the electron and hole numbers and avoids possible
scattering effects by charged impurities within the Fe-As planes, which
is still ambiguous in carrier-doped systems.

Here we present an optical study on EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂ in wide
temperature and energy ranges. When crossing T_(c), clear evidence of a
superconducting gap is observed at 74 cm⁻¹. The normalized conductivity
resembles the BCS behavior with a complete gap 2Δ₀ = 3.7δ_(B)T_(c)
without nodes. In the normal state, upon cooling, the spectral weight of
the Drude component partially moves to a mid-infrared incoherent
contribution, which is referred to as effect of spin-fluctuation-induced
interband interaction.

Single crystalline samples of EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂were grown as
described in Ref. [10]. Specific heat and magnetic susceptibility
measurements indicate a bulk superconducting transition at 28 K,
followed by the magnetic ordering of Eu²⁺ moments at 18 K.[11] The
temperature-dependent reflectivity spectra were measured in a wide
frequency range from 20 to 37 000 cm⁻¹ using two Fourier-transform
infrared spectrometers (30-15 000 cm⁻¹) and a variable-angle
spectroscopic ellipsometer extending up to the ultraviolet (6000-37 000
cm⁻¹, restricted to room temperature). Setups with two different 1.6 K
bolometers (10-60 and 20-100 cm⁻¹) have been employed to check and
independently confirm the low-frequency reflectivity around the
superconducting gap (below 100 cm⁻¹).

In Fig. 1(b), we show the in-plane reflectivity R(ω) of
EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂ at selected temperatures; panel 1(a) is a
blowup of the low-frequency part. The reflectivity has a metallic
behavior both in frequency and temperature. Below T_(c), an upturn with
a change of curvature appears in R(ω) at around 100 cm⁻¹; at the lowest
temperature, the reflectivity reaches unity at 74 cm⁻¹. This is strong
evidence for the superconducting gap formation. The real part of the
optical conductivity σ₁(ω, T) calculated through Kramers-Kronig
procedure is shown in panels 1(c) and 1(e) for different spectral
ranges. Up to 4000 cm⁻¹, σ₁(ω, T T T_(c)) can be well described by a
narrow Drude contribution σ_(N) (τ_(30K)⁻¹≈ 30 cm⁻¹, ω_(p) = 5730 cm⁻¹)
plus a flat plateau, which previously has been defined as a "broad
Drude" σ_(B) (τ_(30K)⁻¹≈ 440 cm⁻¹, ω_(p) = 6800 cm⁻¹), in addition to a
Lorentzian component center at ω₀ = 970 cm⁻¹.[12, 13, 14, 15] For
T < T_(c), σ₁(ω) drops rapidly to zero with decreasing frequency,
indicating a nodeless s-wave superconducting gap. σ₁(ω) at higher
energies can be modeled by several Lorentzian-type contributions, as
demonstrated in Fig. 1(d).

Multiple superconducting gaps have been reported in the literature for
the 122-family of pnictides,[16] which is not surprising for multiband
materials.[2] With this in mind, we also performed a BCS-based gap
analysis for the optical properties of EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂ to see
whether we gain information on the number of gaps and their magnitude.
As mentioned above, two superimposed Drude components σ_(N) and σ_(B)
are needed to describe the normal state conductivity of
EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂. Correspondingly, we tried to decompose the
conductivity in the superconducting state σ^((i)) as
σ_(N)^((i)) + σ_(B)^((i)) assuming no interplay between them. In the
simplest case, each of these independent components is described by the
BCS theory[17] in the form given in Ref. [18]. Surprisingly, the best
description of σ^((i))/σ^((i)) is reached using the same gap parameter:
2Δ_(N) = 2Δ_(B) = 74 cm⁻¹, as shown in Fig. 1(f). This implies a single
s-wave gap 2Δ₀ = 3.7k_(B)T_(c) in EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂. Note that,
with 2Δ_(N) > τ₁^(−N), the narrow Drude falls into the clean limit,
where a gap is difficult be observed in σ₁. Nevertheless, our
calculations of σ₁(ω) evidence that assuming a second larger gap
2Δ_(N) = 150 cm⁻¹ (∼7.7k_(B)T_(c), a typical value for large gap in
thetides) would cause a clear drop of σ₁ of about 600 (Ω cm⁻¹) at 150
cm⁻¹–a similar effect can be also seen from σ₁⁽¹⁾(ω)/σ₁^((ω))(ω), as
shown in Fig. 1(f). Since we do not observe any of this kind of decrease
in our measured data from 75-400 cm⁻¹, we conclude the absence of a
second larger gap in EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18)). Furthermore, it is not
necessary to introduce nodes in the gap, as recently suggested [19, 20]
from experiments on BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂. Although there is a
low-energy limit of our optical data, at that point the reflectance is
flat and close to unity, leaving no space for nodes below the
measurement frequencies. This issue can be due to magnetic scattering
induced by Eu²⁺ ions that may lift the nodes. Further investigation is
needed to support this suggestion.

From the optical conductivity, we extract the superconducting
penetration depth λ(T) of EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂. According to the
Ferrell-Gloyer-Tinkham sum rule,[17] the missing spectral weight
A = ∫₀₊^(∞)[σ₁⁽¹⁾(ω) − σ₁^((s))(ω)]dω is connected to the superfluid
density ρ_(s) = 8A/c² and to the penetration depth as A = c²/8λ².
Alternatively, one can also estimate λ(T) from the imaginary part of the
complex conductivity in the low-frequency limit:
$\sigma_{2}(\omega)=\frac{\pi N\epsilon^{2}}{m\omega}=\frac{c^{2}}{4g^{2}\lambda ^{2}\omega}$.
We consistently obtain λ(T → 0) ≈ 300 nm, which is very close to the
value found for the other 122 non pnictides, such as
Ba(Fe_(0.92)Co_(0.08))₂As₂ and Ba(Fe_(0.95)Ni_(0.05))₂As₂.[14] The
temperature dependence of the penetration depth is plotted in Fig. 1(g)
in the form of λ(0)²/λ(T)² versus T/T_(c). The data fall nicely onto the
curve 1 − (T/T_(c))⁴ as predicted by the two-fluid model and commonly
used to describe a simple s-wave gap at moderate T. These findings are
consistent with our gap analysis and confirm the s-wave superconducting
gap formation in EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂.

Above, we concluded that a large superconducting gap
(2Δ₀ ≫ 3.5k_(B)T_(c)) is absent in this P-substituted MFe₂As₂ material,
albeit in the carrier-doped iron pnictides multiple gaps with large
values are commonly found.[16, 21, 22, 23, 24] To understand this
difference, we have to consider the band structure, as depicted in Fig.
2. The undoped MFe₂As₂ contains three sheets of Fermi surface with hole
character (h-FS) at the Γ point and two electron sheets (e-FS) at the M
point of the Brillouin zone.[6, 25] While the inner two h-FSs and the
two e-FSs are basically two dimensional, the third h-FS is more three
dimensional, as it has a stronger dispersion along k_(z).[26] The
antiferromagnetic (spin-density-wave) ordering happens along the nesting
vector Q_(n) indicated by the arrow. With hole doping, the h-FSs and
e-FSs expand and shrink, respectively, along the k_(x)k_(y) plane [Fig.
2(b)], causing a considerable

weakening of the nesting; spin fluctuations increase. Angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies on optimally doped
Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂ show that the dispersion of the FSs remains
similar to the undoped compounds; a large portion of the inner h-FSs is
still connected (quasticised) to the e-FSs by the same Q_(x), and this
enhances the scattering from the e-FSs to the h-FSs and yields a very
large pairing strength (2Δ₀ = 7.5k_(B)T_(c)) for these FSs.[7]

In P-substituted MFe₂As₂, on the contrary, the isovalent substitution
does not introduce carriers, hence no expansion or shrinkage of FSs is
expected. However, according to band structure calculations,[66, 27] the
P substitution can enhance the dimensionality of h-FSs since it is very
sensitive to the pnictogen position. As observed in recent ARPES
investigations on P-substituted EuFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x)), the k_(z)
dispersion increases and varies along the Γ-Z line while it remains
small and is slightly modified along the K-X line, namely, the h-FSs
start to warp but e-FSs keep almost unchanged upon P substitution.[28]
Such warpings of hole-FSs break the nesting condition and eventually
enable superconductivity. At the same time, the three warped h-FSs rule
out the possibility for their large magnetic overlapping with two e-FSs,
which would cause a large pairing strength as discussed above for
carrier-doped pnictides. This peculiarity of the P-substituted systems
can explain the absence of a _large_ superconducting gap in
EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18)). Interestingly, although the "quasines" between
the FSs in the P-substituted case is not as good as the one with carrier
doping, the pairing constant we observed here is not getting much lower
either (2Δ₀ = 3.7k_(B)T_(c)); it is still comparable with the smaller
gap found in, for example, Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂ where
2Δ₀ = 3.8k_(B)T_(c). Considering this issue together with the very
similar critical temperatures of EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂and
Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂, one could suspect that the three-dimensional
character of the h-FS(s) is one of the obstacles to raise a higher T_(c)
in pnictide.

More insight into the _interband_ interaction between hole and electron
bands is obtained from our spectral weight analysis, in particular, when
we consider a spectral weight redistribution from low to high energies
upon cooling. In Fig. 3(a), the spectral weight SW(ω_(c)) =
8∫₀^(ω_(c))σ₁(ω) dω is plotted as a function of cutoff frequency ω_(c).
Up to 10 000 cm⁻¹, the SW(ω_(c), T) is still not conserved. An upturn
around 3000-5000 cm⁻¹ is observed, indicating that a spectral weight
redistribution starts within this frequency range. To elucidate this
point, we normalize SW(T < 300 K) to SW(300 K) and plot it in Fig. 3(b).
We find that the spectral weight is reduced up to 5

Fermi surfaces, and two at the M point are electronlike Fermi surfaces.

2Δ₀ = 7.5k_(B)T_(c) opens at the inner two hole-FSs (red sheets) and two
electron-FSs (green sheets), while the small gap 2Δ₀ = 3.7k_(B)T_(c)
opens at the outer hole-FS (blue sheet). (c) P substitution in

a very different redistribution of the spectral weight in the density of
states (DOS) from the one in the rigid band shift.[30] As described by
Benfatto and Cappelluti, the peculiar long tail in the DOS can be
considered as a characteristic signature of the interband nature of
interaction. More important in the context of optical properties, it
causes an enhanced incoherent contribution aside from the reduction of
coherent Drude part. Since this is consistent with our present findings,
we consider the observed spectral weight transfer from the Drude to
incoherent contributions in optics as experimental evidence for the
spin-fluctuation-induced _interband_ interaction. The continuous
transfer of spectral weight upon cooling, namely, a stronger
interband-interaction-induced FS shrinkage with decreasing temperature,
should then imply stronger spin fluctuations as T_(c) is approached.

Our infrared study on isovalent P-substituted EuFe₂(As_(0.82)P_(0.18))₂
gives clear evidence for the formation of a single nodeless s-wave
superconducting gap. From the comparison with the multigap scenario of
carrier-doped iron pnictides, we found that the similarity in geometry
and dimension between hole and electron Fermi-surface sheets has a
strong influence not only on the nesting for the spin-density-wave state
but also on the pairing conditions for the superconducting state. This
is considered as another indication that the pairing between the Fermi
surface sheets very much relies on spin excitations along the nesting
vector; in other words, superconductivity in iron pnictide has magnetic
origin. The continuous spectral weight transfer upon cooling from the
coherent (Drude) to the incoherent contributions indicates an enhanced
spin-fluctuation-induced interband interaction as the superconducting
transition is approached.
