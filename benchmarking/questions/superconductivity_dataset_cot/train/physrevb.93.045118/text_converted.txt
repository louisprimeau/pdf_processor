###### Abstract

The temperature (_T_) as a function of pressure (_P_) phase diagram is
reported for the cubic Laves phase compound Au2Pb, which was recently
proposed to support linearly dispersing topological bands, together with
conventional quadratic bands. At ambient pressure, Au2Pb exhibits
several structural phase transitions at T1 = 97 K, T2 = 51 K, and T3 =
40 K with superconductivity below _T_c = 1.2 K. Applied pressure results
in a rich phase diagram where T1, T2, and T3 evolve strongly with P and
a possible new phase is stabilized for P > 0.64 GPa that also supports
superconductivity below 1.1 K. These observations suggest that Au2Pb is
an ideal system in which to investigate the relationship between
structural degrees of freedom, band topology, and resulting anomalous
behaviors.

## I Introduction

The cubic Laves phase compounds M2_X_ can be considered as being
relatives of the pyrochlore structure, where the tetrahedrally arranged
M atoms are distributed inside a face-centered-cubic arrangement of X
atoms [1]. Prior work has shown that this structure accommodates a
multitude of binary chemical combinations [2], making it a deep
reservoir for electronic and magnetic states including superconductivity
[3, 4, 5], electronic valence changes [6, 7], itinerant electron
magnetism [8], geometrically frustrated magnetism [9], and other
effects. Recent work addressing Au2Pb indicates that this family of
materials is now expanded to include topologically protected electronic
states. The calculated electronic band structure for Au2Pb includes a
crystallographically protected Dirac point at room temperature, in
addition to other conventional bands at the Fermi energy (_E_F) [10].
With decreasing temperature, Au2Pb undergoes several structural phase
transitions at T1 = 97 K, T2 = 51 K, and T3 = 40 K. Below T3, Au2Pb
enters a primitive orthorhombic structure, where electronic structure
calculations predict that the Dirac point is gapped but retains
topological protection. Other band crossings at _E_F are also present at
low T, providing conduction electrons that produce metallic behavior and
conventional BCS superconductivity (_T_c 1.2 K).

While the presence of conventional bands at _E_F makes Au2Pb distinct
from simple three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (at high _T_) [11] or
topological insulators (at low _T_) [12], it is of interest because it
offers the opportunity to study the relationship between conventional
electrons and quasiparticles associated with linearly dispersing bands.
This includes the question of how conventional BCS superconductivity
might interact with gapped topological bands. It is also possible that
the simultaneous presence of linearly dispersing and quadratic bands
could result in unusual transport and thermodynamic properties. The
complex structural evolution additionally allows for a study of how a
Dirac point is influenced by changes in the crystal symmetry.

Hydrostatic pressure is a useful tool to systematically probe lattice
structures and concomitant electronic states. For this reason, we
undertook to study electrical transport under applied pressure P < 1.8
GPa in single crystals of Au2Pb. Our measurements reveal an unusually
rich _T_-_P_ phase diagram that includes several structural phases and
superconducting regions. In particular, we find that while T1 increases
monotonically for pressures up to 1.83 GPa, T2 and T3 are initially
suppressed and meet near P1 0.64 GPa. For P P1 0.64 GPa, another likely
phase boundary that may be structural in nature is seen at T4, which
increases with P. Superconductivity is seen at low temperatures
throughout the entire measured P range. This multitude of structural
phases and the persistence of superconductivity will be useful for
uncovering anomalous electronic behavior and disentangling topological
behaviors from those that are due to material specific details. We
additionally compare to the Laves phase analog, Au2Bi, which is a
conventional metal that does not exhibit any structural phase
transitions but does support superconductivity.

## II Experimental Methods

Single crystals of Au2Pb were grown using a molten Pb flux as described
previously [10]. Elemental Au and Pb were mixed in the ratio 2:3 and
sealed under vacuum in a quartz tube. The mixture was heated at a rate
of 50 degC/h to 600 degC, held at this temperature for 24 h, and slowly
cooled at a rate of 3 degC/h to 300 degC. The crystals were separated
from the flux by centrifuging at this temperature. Single crystals of
Au2Bi were made using a similar approach, where the molar ratio was 3:7.

Single crystals of Au2Pb and Au2Bi were structurally characterized at
room temperature by single crystal x-ray diffraction using an
Oxford-Diffraction Xcalibur 2 CCD system with graphite monochromated Mo
_K_a_ radiation. Data was collected using o scans with 1deg frame widths
to a resolution of 0.5 A, equivalent to 2_th_ = 90deg. The data
collection, indexation, and absorption correction were performed using
the Agilent CrysAlisPro software [13]. Subsequent structure refinement
was performed by using crystals[14]. A crystallographic information file
for Au2Pb has been deposited with ICSD (CSD No. 430187) [15]. For
subsequent measurements, single crystals were selected and aligned using
a four-axis Enraf Nouius CAD-4 single crystal x-ray diffractometer. The
obtained orientation matrix allowed for an unambiguous determination of
the crystalline axes to within a degree.

Specimens were prepared for electrical resistivity ρ measurements by
attaching Pt wires using a homebuilt microspot welder. Samples of Au2Pb
were loaded into a piston-cylinder pressure cell. The pressure P was
determined by measuring the superconducting transition of 6N
polycrystalline Pb. Daphne 7474 oil was used as the
pressure-transmitting medium [16,17]. The electrical resistivity ρ was
measured with currents applied along the [100] direction (at room
temperature) for temperatures 1.8 K  < T< 300 K and P≤ 1.8 GPa using a
Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System and an SR830 lock-in
amplifier with a Keithley 6221 as the current source. Additional
resistivity measurements under applied pressure were performed at the
National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Tallahassee, for temperatures
between 500 mK  < T< 2 K using a standard He-3 cryostat. Electrical
resistivity and heat capacity measurements were performed at ambient
pressure on an aligned single crystal of Au2Bi using the He-3 option in
a Quantum Design physical properties measurement system for temperatures
400 mK  < T< 20 K.

## III Results

Our measurements verify that Au2Pb and Au2Bi crystallize in the space
group $Fd\bar{3}m$ (No. 227) where Au2Pb has unit cell parameter
a = 7.9141(2) A [Fig. 1(a)]; the structural parameters resulting from
the x-ray refinement for Au2Pb are summarized in Table 1. Au2Pb and
Au2Bi are cubic Laves phases with a pyrochlore lattice [1], where the
gold is in the 16c position at (0, 0, 0) and lead/bismuth are in the 8b
position at (3/8, 3/8, 3/8) (Table 2). The single crystal x-ray
diffraction for Au2Pb displayed a site vacancy defect on the Pb site,
yielding a formal stoichiometry of Au2Pb0.95. For simplicity, the
compound will be referred to as Au2Pb throughout the rest of the paper.

The gold atoms form a network of corner-shared tetrahedra connected
along the ⟨111⟩ directions, with a Au-Au distance of 2.798 A. The gold
network in turn forms voids in which the lead atoms reside as trigonal
chains along ⟨110⟩, with a Pb-Pb distance of 3.427 A. Au is 12-fold
coordinated, surrounded by six Au atoms and six Pb atoms [Fig. 1(b)],
forming a icosahadron. Pb is 16-fold coordinated with 12 Au atoms and
four Pb atoms surrounding it [Fig. 1(c)], forming a 16-vertex
Frank-Kasper polyhedron [1].

The ambient pressure electrical resistivities for Au2Pb and Au2Bi are
shown in Fig. 2. The residual resistivity ratios RRR = ρ₃₀₀ k/ρ₀ for
Au2Pb and Au2Bi are 9 and 20, respectively. For Au2Pb, the structural
transitions at T₂ = 51 K and T₃ = 40 K are easily observed and
superconductivity appears below $T_{\rm c}=1.2$ K [Fig. 2(b)], as
previously reported [10]. In comparison, Au2Bi shows typical metallic
behavior with no evidence for structural phase transitions, suggesting
that it is useful as a conventional metallic Laves phase analog to
Au2Pb. We additionally find that Au2Bi exhibits superconductivity near
1.7 K [Fig. 2(b)], as previously reported [18]. Heat capacity
measurements [Fig. 2(c)] show that the Au2Bi superconductivity occurs in
the bulk, where the ratio $\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}$ = 1.9, is
comparable to what is seen for Au2Pb [10]. This value is larger than
what is expected for a BCS superconductor
($\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}=1.43$), but is smaller than that of
elemental lead [19]. A fit to the data using the expression
C/T = γ + βT² gives an electronic coefficient γ = 2.3 mJ/mol K² and a
Debye temperature $\Theta_{\rm D}$ = 153 K (β = 1.6 mJ/mol K⁴). For
Au2Pb, we find γ = 1.9 mJ/mol K² and $\Theta_{\rm D}$ = 133 K, as
previously reported [10].

The electrical resistivity as a function of temperature under several
values of hydrostatic pressure is shown in Fig. 3.

Metallic behavior is seen for all pressures with a room temperature
resistivity of 35.9 μΩ cm for P = 0, which decreases to 33.0 μΩ cm for
P = 1.83 GPa. We find residual resistivity ratios RRR =
$\rho_{295\,\rm K}/\rho_{0}$ in the range 8.1-9.2, slightly increasing
with increasing P. The previously reported transition at T₁ appears as a
weak reduction in ρ, which becomes more pronounced and increases with
increasing P at a rate of 19 K/GPa [Fig. 3(b)], indicating that this
phase transition would occur at room temperature near P ≈ 9 GPa. T₂ and
T₃ appear as sharp reductions in the resistivity, consistent with an
earlier report of structural phase transitions at these temperatures
under ambient pressure [Figs. 3(a), 3(d), 3(e)] [10]. The features at T₂
and T₃ decrease linearly at rates of 21.5 K/GPa and 1.8 K/GPa,
respectively, and finally intersect near P₁ ≈ 0.64 GPa (determined by
extrapolation). For pressures larger than 0.64 GPa, another phase
transition appears as a sharp reduction in the resistivity at T₄, which
produces a more pronounced decrease in resistivity than T₂ and T₃
combined. Unlike T₂ and T₃, T₄ increases linearly at a rate of 12.6
K/GPa, reaching 52 K at P = 1.83 GPa [Fig. 3(d)]. All of the observed
phase transitions show hysteresis under P (summarized in Fig. 5). At low
temperature and zero pressure, bulk superconductivity is observed below
$T_{\rm c}=1.2$ K. Superconductivity persists at 1 GPa, with a slightly
reduced transition temperature T_(c) = 1.1 K [Fig. 3(e)].

Plots of the resistivity at constant temperature under varying pressure
ρ(P) are shown in Fig. 4. For T > 51 K, ρ(P) is nearly constant for
P < 1.8 GPa. For T ≤ 51 K, there is a large reduction of ρ which first
appears at large P and T and moves to lower P with decreasing T. For 38
K  < T < 51 K,

temperature T at pressures 0 GPa  ≤ P ≤ 1.83 GPa for Au₂Pb. Note that
the sharp kink for P = 0 near T = 100 K is an artifact due to a change
in the T sweep rate in this data set only. Smaller kinks are also seen
in panel (d) near 50 K for the same reason. (b) Zoom of ρ(T) at several

there is a second transition at lower pressures that evolves with
temperature. For T < 38 K, there is a single transition pressure that
remains nearly constant at P₁ ≈ 0.64 GPa with decreasing T. We infer
that these features are associated with the proposed low temperature
structural phase transitions seen in ρ(T).

These results are collected in Fig. 5 to build the T-P phase diagram.
The solid circles are the ρ(T) cool down curves (Fig. 3), the hollow
circles are from the ρ(T) of warm up curves and the triangles are from
ρ(P) (Fig. 4). While the precise location of the phase boundaries in the
phase diagram need additional measurements to establish the extent of
the phase fields (particularly where T₂ and T₃ intersect), there appear
to be five distinct regions including the previously described Dirac
semimetal phase which extends from room temperature to T = 97 K for
P = 0 and several other low T phases labeled 1-4. Region 1 spans the
entire pressure range. Region 2 is a small wedge separating 1 and 3.
Regions 3 and 4 are the low T/low P and low T/high P phases which are
separated by the nearly vertical phase boundary at P₁ ≈ 0.64 GPa. We
further find that superconductivity is present in both regions 3 and 4,
where the transition temperature is slightly suppressed by  ≈ 0.1 K in
region 4.

## IV Discussion

The past several years have witnessed intense interest in materials that
support novel electronic states arising from unusual band structures.
Examples include materials with topologically protected linearly
dispersing bands such as Dirac semimetals (Na₃Bi [20] and Cd₃As₂[21]),
Weyl semimetals (Nb,Ta)(P,As) [22], and topological insulators
[Bi₂(Se,Te)₃] [12], as well as other unusual metallic phenomena such as
the axial anomaly (PdCoO₂[23]). While these materials exhibit remarkable
behavior, they are often limited in terms of opportunities to test
microscopic models by transforming their thermodynamic ground state:
e.g., using probes such as applied pressure. As demonstrated in this
study, Au₂Pb and potentially the alloy Au₂Pb_(1 − x)Bi_(x) provide the
unusual examples where the evolution of topological behavior under the
influence of intrinsic structural phase transitions can be
systematically explored. In order to do this, it will first be important
to determine the structures and electronic characteristics of regions 1,
2, and 4 and to carry out accompanying band structure calculations.

The presence of superconductivity in both the low and high pressure
regions for Au₂Pb presents additional opportunities. Prior work suggests
that the ambient pressure superconductivity in Au₂Pb occurs in the bulk
and can be described as being due to weak coupling electron-phonon
interactions in the BCS framework. It is appealing to attribute this
superconductivity to the quadratically dispersing bands that are
predicted to cross $E_{\rm F}$ along the Γ-K line: i.e., the
"conventional bands." [10]. If this is the right picture, then Au₂Pb is
a model system in which to investigate what happens in a material that
hosts both conventional superconductivity and gapped linearly dispersing
bands. Prior work suggests that such a material might support Majorana
fermions [24], although this has yet to be substantiated. Comparison to
Au₂Bi will help to independently determine whether behavior seen in
Au₂Pb is uniquely associated with topological bands.

Our pressure study further amplifies the novelty of this situation by
showing that there likely is a distinct high pressure phase which also
supports superconductivity. It will be of interest to determine whether
the high pressure phase includes topological bands and whether they are
significantly different

structural transitions appear as sharp kinks in ρ(P) as described in the
text. The black arrows indicate T₂, the red arrows indicate T₃, and the
blue arrows indicate T₄.

warming curves are from Ref. [10].

from those at ambient pressure. In the case that the high pressure bands
are all conventional, this would give the opportunity to definitively
separate what superconducting behaviors are uniquely associated with the
presence of topological bands. In particular, further studies of the
magnetoresistance and magnetization will be of use to search for unusual
power law behaviors and to index quantum oscillation Landau levels,
which would unambiguously characterize topological behavior.

## V Conclusion

We have presented the T-P phase diagram for the cubic Laves phase
compound Au₂Pb, which supports several structural phases and
superconductivity over a broad range of pressures. At ambient pressure,
we compare it to the conventional metallic Laves phase analog Au₂Bi. Our
observations have important implications for understanding the interplay
between conventional and linearly dispersing bands, particularly with
respect to possible anomalous transport behavior and the relationship
with superconductivity. Owing to its structural tunability, both with
temperature and pressure, it will be possible to systematically explore
these effects under different conditions. Such information is needed to
separate what features should be attributed to topological behavior and
which are merely due to specific details of this material.
