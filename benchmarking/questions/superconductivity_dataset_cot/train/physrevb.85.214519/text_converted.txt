###### Abstract

High-pressure magnetization, structural, and ⁵⁷Fe Mossbauer studies were
performed on superconducting Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2.0 with T_(c) = 32.4 K. The
gradual decrease of T_(c) with increasing pressure up to 5 GPa is
followed by a step-like suppression of superconductivity at higher
pressures. No structural phase transition in the Fe vacancy-ordered
superstructure is observed in synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD)
studies up to 15.6 GPa. The Mossbauer spectra above 5 GPa reveal the
appearance of a new paramagnetic phase, exhibiting magnetic order below
80 K, coinciding with the irreversible disappearance of
superconductivity. We interpret these changes as due to a
pressure-induced diffusion of Rb ions between the two phases,
responsible for the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in
Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2.0.

sample-to-detector distance, and tilting angle of the image plate.
Collected full-circle powder patterns were processed with FIT2D
software. * 57Fe-Mossbauer spectra were using a 57Co(Rh) point source
with an active spot diameter of 0.5 mm. Grained Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2 samples
were prepared with enriched 57Fe (20

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the zero-field cooled
(ZFC) magnetization of Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2 as a function of pressure. _T_c was
determined from the intersection of two extrapolated straight lines
drawn through the data points in the normal state and the steepest part
in the superconducting state. Similarly to observations in the K- and
Cs-intercalated superconductors,12-14,16 _T_c of Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2 shows a
moderate decrease with a rate of - 2.1 K/GPa up to 5 GPa. Then, a sudden
suppression of the diamagnetic ZFC signal occurs at pressures close to 6
GPa and _T_c drops to zero. These results are in excellent agreement
with recent pressure-dependent electrical resistivity studies of
Rb0.8Fe2Se2, especially with the steep decrease of _T_c from 15.5 K at 5
GPa to zero at 5.6 GPa.15 It resembles also the pressure behavior of
_T_c in the related C80.8Fe1.7Se2 compound.16 In K0.8Fe1.7Se2 and
K0.8Fe1.78Se2, however, a more continuous decrease of _T_c up to
critical pressures around 9 GPa is reported.12 The suppression of
superconductivity in the present Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2 sample with pressure is
found to be irreversible: no recovery of the diamagnetic signal was
observed on the release of pressure from 10 GPa to ambient pressure.
This behavior is different to the observations for K0.8Fe1.7Se2, where
superconductivity was reported to reappear after release of pressure.12

The x-ray diffraction patterns shown in Fig. 2(b) reveal the absence of
any structural phase transitions in the magnetic majority phase up to
pressures of 15.6 GPa. Although a rigorous structural refinement was not
performed due to a highly textured sample with different orientations of
the flakes, the superstructure reflections (110), (020), and (220)
corresponding to the _14/m_ structure persist up to the highest
pressures indicating the stability of the vacancy-ordered
$\sqrt{5}\times\sqrt{5}$ superstructure far above the suppression of
superconductivity. The present findings are in excellent agreement with
a recent XRD study of Svitlyk _et al._, where for Rb0.8Fe2-7Se2 the
pressure dependence of lattice parameters and of the superstructure
reflections were studied in detail up to ∼11.0 GPa.19 We therefore
conclude that the suppression of superconductivity in Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2 is
not connected with a structural phase transition in the magnetic
majority phase. This is in contrast to the assumptions in Ref. 12, where
the observed suppression of superconductivity was attributed to the loss
of the superstructure reflections in the magnetic phase without
considering that magnetism and superconductivity are occurring in
A_(x)Fe2-7Se2 systems in strictly separated phases.4-6,9 The
pressure-induced suppression of superconductivity in Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2 is
also not caused by a structural phase transition in the minority phase,
as observed in superconducting FeSe,10 as evidenced in the corresponding
Mossbauer data presented in the following.

The left panel of Fig. 2 shows pressure-dependent Mossbauer spectra of
Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2, recorded at room temperature. At pressures below 5.2 GPa,
the spectra consist of a magnetic sextet which corresponds to the
magnetically ordered component with a $\sqrt{5}\ \times\ \sqrt{5}$
superstructure (denoted as phase **I**) and a paramagnetic (PM) doublet
(phase **II**) with relative fractions of 88(1)

Remarkable changes in the Mossbauer spectra are observed starting from
5.2 GPa, where an additional new PM doublet

appears. The corresponding intensity ratios reveal that this spectral
component emerges mostly from the AFM sextet, indicating a partial
transformation of the AFM phase into a PM state. The hyperfine
parameters of this new PM phase (denoted as phase **III**) at p = 6.5
GPa are: IS(**III**) = 0.50(2) mm/s and QS(**III**) = 0.64(4) mm/s. They
are quite different from those observed in the PM phase **II**, but
close to the corresponding parameters of the still dominant AFM phase
**I** at 6.5 GPa: IS(**I**) = 0.50(1) mm/s, QS(**I**) = 0.85(4) mm/s.
This indicates that in the new PM phase **III** the local crystal
arrangement of Fe atoms, as well as their electronic properties, namely
an Fe²⁺ high-spin state with orbital contributions to the electric field
gradient as established in Ref. [6], are similar to those in the AFM
phase. The relative fraction of the new PM phase **III** progressively
increases with increasing pressure and attains 80(1)

The pressure dependence of the magnetic hyperfine field H_(hf)(I) in the
AFM phase **I** is presented in Fig. 3(b). H_(hf)(I) remains almost
unchanged up to 4.2 GPa, but the clear decrease of H_(hf)(I) from 249(1)
kOe at 5.2 GPa to 235(1) kOe at 8.5 GPa points to a significant change
of the local magnetic and electronic properties at the Fe sites in the
$\sqrt{5}\ \times\ \sqrt{5}$ superstructure. The latter is also
reflected in a concomitant

decrease of QS(**I**) = 1.04(4) mm/s at 5.2 GPa to 0.84(4) mm/s at 8.5
GPa. At higher pressures, the variation of _H_hf(**I**) is again very
small: _H_hf(**I**) = 236(3) kOe at 13.8 GPa. Of specific interest are
the values of the respective hyperfine parameters after release of
pressure to 0.3 GPa: _H_hf(**I**) = 240(4) kOe, which is almost
identical to the value observed at 13.8 GPa, while the value of
QS(**I**) = 1.13(3) mm/s corresponds to the initial ambient pressure
value. A similar trend is observed for the new PM phase **III,** where
QS(**III**) increased from 0.42(1) mm/s at 13.8 GPa to 0.77(1) mm/s at
0.3 GPa.

The most prominent feature presented in Fig. 3 is the clear relation
between the disappearance of superconductivity above 5 GPa and the onset
of a transformation of the AFM phase **I** into a new PM phase **III**,
concomitant with a marked reduction of _H_hf(**I**), pointing to a
change in the magnetic properties. The pressure dependence of the
different phase fractions and _H_hf(**I**) could be well described by
sigmoidal curves (Fig. 3), which supports a scenario of nucleation-like
phase transformations and confirms that the magnetic transformation
starts already in the SC state but is close to the breakdown of
superconductivity. This fact is especially remarkable in view of the
recently established phase separation in alkali-intercalated magnetic
superconductors A_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. According to this
concept, only the minority fraction is metallic and superconducting,
whereas the major fraction is antiferromagnetic and insulating.
According to our recent Mossbauer studies, [6] the superconducting phase
(PM component **II**) has hyperfine parameters close to those observed
in FeSe. Therefore, one can expect that a similar scenario of
suppression of the superconductivity under pressure associated with a
structural phase transition occurs. [10] However, as we found in the
present investigation, the relatively abrupt and irreversible
suppression of superconductivity is not accompanied by a structural
phase transition in the dominant $\sqrt{5}\ \times\ \sqrt{5}$ phase
**I** and also not with strong spectral changes of the minority phase
**II**. The present data demonstrate that the suppression of
superconductivity in Rb_(0.8)Fe_(1.6)Se₂ coincides with the onset of a
sluggish transformation of parts of the dominant AFM phase into a new PM
phase and is also connected with the change of the local magnetic and
electronic properties of the AFM phase. Since also the minority phase
**II**, responsible for superconductivity, is reduced by the same
relative amount (see Fig. 3), one has to look for the responsible
mechanism, reflecting also the irreversibility of both the suppression
of superconductivity in phase **II** and the formation of the new phase
**III**. Of actual interest are also the magnetic properties of this new
phase **III**. For this reason a second series of high-pressure
Mossbauer spectra of the same sample were recorded, now also a low
temperatures.

The Mossbauer spectrum recorded first at p = 7.6 GPa and room
temperature clearly shows only phase **III**, while phases **I** and
**II** are not detectable (right panel of Fig. 2). The spectrum measured
at T = 78 K exhibits beside the dominant phase **III** an additional
subspectrum with a broadened magnetic splitting, indicating the onset of
magnetic order. Further cooling to 4.2 K reveals a full transformation
of the paramagnetic phase **III** into a broad static magnetic spectrum.
Fitting this spectrum based on a model with a distribution of hyperfine
parameters provides the distribution function _P_(_H_hf) of magnetic
hyperfine fields with the main peak located at _H_hf = 274(2) kOe (inset
of Fig. 2, right panel). A remarkable feature of the distribution
function at 7.6 GPa is a plateau below _H_hf <= 200 kOe, indicating that
part of the Fe moments are reduced by pressure. The release of pressure
leads to essential recovery of the Fe moments, as demonstrated by the
Mossbauer spectrum measured at T = 4.2 K and p = 0.3 GPa, which can be
well fitted with a sharper distribution function centered at (_H_hf) =
284(2) kOe. This value and also the average quadrupole splitting ⟨QS⟩ =
1.1(1) mm/s, almost identical to that of the initial sample at ambient
pressure, [6] signify the close relation between the pressure-modified
magnetic phase with random order and the original well-ordered magnetic
phase **I**. It is important to note that the paramagnetic fraction
**II** is completely absent in this well-resolved spectrum. The room
temperature Mossbauer spectrum measured at the end of the second
pressure cycle at p = 0.3 GPa exhibits 85(1)

The observed irreversibility in the superconducting and magnetic
properties in Rb_(0.8)Fe_(1.6)Se₂ induced by pressure suggests some
irreversible local structural changes without a global change of the
crystal symmetry, especially of the $\sqrt{5}\ \times\ \sqrt{5}$
superstructure. Remarkably, the magnetic and superconducting properties
of the AFM (phase **I**) and PM

fractions of the PM component **II** (up triangles), the PM component
**III** (solid circles), and the AFM fraction **I** (squares). Down
triangles result from rescaling the amount of the PM fraction **II**.
This procedure makes evident that under pressure the PM phase **II**
behaves similarly to the AFM phase **I**, and that a new component
**III** develops at the expense of both phases **I** and **II**. (b)

(phase **II**) mixture stay intact up to pressures of 5 GPa. The
suppression of superconductivity with further increase of pressure is
connected with the onset of the transformation of parts of the AFM phase
**I** and the minority phase **II**, associated with the
superconductivity, into the PM phase **III**. The Mossbauer spectra from
the second pressure cycle indicate a complete and irreversible
disappearance of this minority fraction **II**. These spectra also show
that the average values $\langle H_{\rm hf}\rangle$ and ⟨QS⟩ are after
release of pressure close to the corresponding values of the AFM
majority phase before application of pressure. This indicates that on
the average the local magnetic moments of Fe atoms and their local
surroundings are conserved. However, the strong broadening of the
spectral lines indicates that pressure induces local disorder and thus
diminishes the electronic and magnetic differences of both phases.
Therefore we suppose that the pressure-induced disorder is caused by
short-range diffusion of Rb ions within the layers above a threshold
pressure of 5 GPa. Such a diffusion process of the Rb ions seems to be
thermodynamically much more probable than that of Fe ions, as documented
by the preservation of the $\sqrt{S}\ \times\ \sqrt{5}$ superstructure
up to 15.6 GPa. In this context, one should consider the enormous
difference in the Rb layer density between the magnetic Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2
phase and the superconducting Rb0.3Fe2Se2 phase,[9] intimately connected
with an enormous amount of phase boundaries due to the filamentary shape
of the minority phase.[4, 5, 7] The observed sharp disappearance of the
superconductivity above 5 GPa might be also attributed to the fact that
the new PM phase **III** is growing in the phase boundaries between the
phases **I** and **II** and exhibiting metallic behavior with conduction
electrons penetrating into the superconducting phase **II**.

Indeed, a pressure-induced change from semiconducting towards metallic
behavior is reported in Ref. [12], coinciding with the disappearance of
superconductivity. Joint conduction bands of the new phase **III**,
which orders magnetically at low temperature, and of the metallic phase
**II** would suppress superconductivity, especially if one considers the
large values of the local magnetic moment of Fe ions (approximately 3
μ_(B)) and the corresponding huge exchange/transferred fields far
exceeding second critical fields. The same holds, if the still dominant
AFM phase would became metallic at pressures above 5 GPa. Apparently,
any incomplete compensation of these moments due to their random
magnetic order could destroy the neighboring superconducting state, as
proposed in Ref. [21].

The present Mossbauer experiments demonstrate that pressure above 5 GPa
causes irreversible local changes in Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2 presumably due to Rb
diffusion between the two phases. In this respect, one can suppose that
the new PM component **III** observed here is related to the
paramagnetic phase in A${}_{\rm{x}}$Fe2-${}_{\rm{y}}$Se2 systems (A = K,
Tl0.6Rh0.4) occurring above the suppression of superconductivity and
below the reentrant superconductivity at higher pressures reported in
Ref. [22]. The observed decrease of the magnetic moments under pressure,
as reflected by their hyperfine fields (Fig. 2, inset), could tend to a
nonmagnetic ground state at higher pressures.

In summary, our pressure experiments show that the dominating AFM phase
and the superconducting minority phase in Rb0.8Fe1.6Se2 are reduced
above 5 GPa with increasing pressure on the expense of a new
paramagnetic phase, appearing concomitantly with the suppression of
superconductivity. Here we propose as a possible reason for the
appearance of the new phase as well as for the suppression of
superconductivity a pressure-assisted diffusion of Rb atoms, which
irreversibly alters the electronic and magnetic properties of both
phases. The growth of the new PM phase might be associated with the
reentrant superconductivity observed at higher pressure in
superconducting A${}_{\rm{x}}$Fe2-${}_{\rm{y}}$Se2 systems.[22]
