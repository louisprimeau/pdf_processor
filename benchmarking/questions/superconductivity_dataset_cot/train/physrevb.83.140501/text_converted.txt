###### Abstract

We demonstrate the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism
in Bi₃Ni nanostructures that have been prepared by making use of novel
chemical-reaction paths. We have characterized their magnetic and
superconducting properties by means of magnetometry and
electrical-transport measurements. Other than in bulk geometry,
submicrometer-sized particles and quasi-one-dimensional nanoscaled
strains of single-phase Bi₃Ni undergo ferromagnetic order.
Superconductivity in confined Bi₃Ni emerges in the ferromagnetically
ordered phase and is stable up to remarkably high magnetic fields.
Uniquely, ferromagnetic hysteresis at zero resistance is observed in
nanostructured Bi₃Ni.

Superconductivity and ferromagnetism, two fundamental ground states of
condensed matter, are observed to be highly competitive in almost any
material. Predominant ferromagnetic exchange interactions destroy
superconductivity by creating a reentrant phase transition as observed
in ErRh₄B₄, HoMo₆S₈, and related materials.[1] Only very few compounds
have been identified so far that show a coexistence of these competing
ground states. In AuIn₂, a small exchange field of ferromagnetically
ordered nuclear magnetic moments is not destroying, although clearly
affecting, the Cooper-pair condensate at μK temperatures.[2] In UGe₂,[3]
as well as related compounds such as URhGe (Ref. 4) and UCoGe,[5] the
coexistence might be even more surprising as superconductivity emerges
at temperatures where ferromagnetism is already established. The
itinerant character of 5f electrons in UGe₂ might play a crucial role
for the coexistence.[3] This is in striking contrast to any other
material, in particular, to metallic elements. Among the elements, only
few representatives such as Rh (Ref. 6) and granular Pt (Ref. 7) reveal
a coexistence of Cooper pairs in balance with weak magnetic correlations
that do not establish a magnetically ordered ground state. Even
materials where superconductivity coexists with a magnetic ground state
that solely exhibits a weak ferromagnetic component of its
magnetization, e.g., Y₉Co₇,[8] the magnetic high-temperature
superconductor RuSr₂GdCu₂O₈ (Ref. 9) or ErNi₂B₂C where weak
ferromagnetic ordering arises at twin boundaries of antiferromagnetic
domains,[10] are very rare. The study of electronically confined
intermetallics, however, may bear the chance to find much more systems
that exhibit coexistence phenomena of superconductivity and magnetism.
As shown here for the material Bi₃Ni, structural confinement creates
ferromagnetic order in a material that is nonmagnetic in bulk topology.
At lowest temperatures, these size-dependent magnetic correlations
eventually compete and surprisingly coexist with superconductivity.

Superconductivity in the intermetallic compound Bi₃Ni had been reported
many years ago.[11] Although containing the transition metal Ni, it is
known to be "nonmagnetic."[12] In fact, the Ni 3_d_-electron band is
filled, and bulk Bi₃Ni exhibits temperature-independent Pauli
paramagnetism. For this reason, an interplay of superconductivity and
magnetism could have only been studied by gradually replacing the
3_d_-electron element by magnetic 4_f_-electron lanthanide ions, as has
been performed for the isostructural compound Bi₃Sr_(1 − x)Eu_(x).[13]

The crystal structure of Bi₃Ni is best described as a packing of Bi₃Ni
rods [Fig. 1(a)] (Refs. 14, 15, 16) where, according to density
functional theory calculations, the bonding in the rods is dominated by
Bi-Ni and Ni-Ni interactions while Bi-Bi bonds play a minor role.[16]
The electron-localization function reveals a separation of delocalized
conduction electrons inside the prism rods and largely localized valence
electrons between them. Overall, the bonding between the intermetallic
rods is clearly weaker than inside them, leading to a preservation of
this structural fragment in the halogenides of Bi₃Ni,[17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] are,
according to by insulating iodide anions [Fig. 1(b)]. For the synthesis
of nanostructured Bi₃Ni, we have treated Bi₁₂Ni₄I₃ with n-butyllithium
at room temperature in order to remove the iodine. This reductive
etching of Bi₁₂Ni₄I₃ resulted in a pseudomorhopsis of the crystalline
material into a three-dimensional (3D) assembly of nanofibers of Bi₃Ni
[Fig. 1(c)]. We may assume that the spatial arrangement of the
one-dimensional (1D) Bi₃Ni rods present in the iodide Bi₁₂Ni₄I₃ is
preserved owing to the mild conditions, because the reformation of the
rod packing of the bulk phase is kinetically hindered. The x-ray powder
diffraction pattern of nanostructured Bi₃Ni only shows broad humps that
correspond to typical interatomic distances in Bi₃Ni [Fig. 1(d)].[16] In
other words, similar to a nematic liquid crystal, macroscopic
superrystals of incoherently but parallel packed nanofibers with
individual diameters below 5 nm were obtained. Only upon annealing the
nanostructured Bi₃Ni at ∼700 K, the 3D order of the crystalline bulk
material is regained. The recrystallization was used for the preparation
of bulk Bi₃Ni (bulk powder with grain diameters ≳ 20 μm) as a reference
material. The precursor compound Bi₁₂Ni₄I₃ shows a
temperature-independent diamagnetic susceptibility of −30 μemun/g. Thus,
hypothetical traces of Bi₁₂Ni₄I₃ would not bias the magnetic moments of
the Bi₃Ni samples. However, Bi₁₂Ni₄I₃ is not detectible in the x-ray
diffraction pattern of the nanostructured Bi₃Ni sample [Fig. 1(d)] and
no iodine has been found in the chemical analysis by energy-dispersive
x-ray spectroscopy. In order to allow for the investigation of the
properties of Bi₃Ni at a length scale intermediate between bulk powder
and the nanostructured material, a microwave-assisted low-temperature
synthesis starting from metal acetates was developed. Under a variation
of external parameters, phase-pure crystalline Bi₃Ni particles with a
uniform size and shape (l ≈ 600 nm, d ≈ 200 nm) were obtained [Fig.
1(e)]. This material is subsequently denoted as submicrometer Bi₃Ni.

For the characterization of the superconducting and magnetic sample
properties, magnetization has been measured by means of superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) and vibrating-sample magnetometry at
temperatures between 1.8 and 300 K. Measurements of the electrical
transport properties were performed by means of an ac four-terminal
contact technique. A commercial cryostat equipped with a superconducting
14-T magnet and a ³He refrigerator were used for measurements in the
temperature range between 0.35 and 300 K.

Bi₃Ni in bulk, submicrometer, as well as nanostructured topology
exhibits type-II superconductivity. In bulk Bi₃Ni powder prepared for
this work, a superconducting transition temperature, T_(c) = 4.06 K [see
Fig. 2(a)], has been observed in accordance with literature.[11] We have
identified a Meissner phase up to a field of μ₀H_(c1) ≈ 15 mT, followed
by a Shubnikov phase that extends up to approximately μ₀H_(c2) = 0.4 T
(not shown). As compared to bulk material, type-II superconductivity
escorted by widened transitions with an elevated onset temperature (see
also Fig. 4) but reduced 50

Apparently, the origin of ferromagnetic spin-spin couplings in Bi₃Ni is
a direct result of the reduction of the sample size in less than 3D. The
size confinement leads to a high surface fraction, which modifies the
electronic band structure, e.g., owing to surface-tension effects. As
compared to bulk Bi₃Ni, the Bloch states of quasiparticles in confined
Bi₃Ni are modified and electron-electron interactions might be affected
by additional scattering mechanisms, as discussed for Pt.[24] A
hypothetical partial depletion of the Ni-3d conduction electron band
would give rise to the formation of magnetic moments and their
correlations in submicrometer and nanostructured Bi₃Ni. For
nanostructured Bi₃Ni, the transformation from a 3D into a 1D structure
with essentially reduced interaction between Bi₃Ni strands may further
affect the band structure.

## Structure-Induced Coexistence of ...

For deeper insight into the superconducting and magnetic properties as
well as their mutual interplay, we have investigated the magnetic
properties of nanostructured and submicrometer Bi₃Ni at higher magnetic
fields (Fig.3). In these confined Bi₃Ni structures, ferromagnetic
hysteresis modified by superconducting diamagnetic screening emerges
below T_(c) [Fig. 3(a)]. Most interestingly, ferromagnetic hysteresis
and superconductivity appear in the same sample volume. This can clearly
be seen for submicrometer Bi₃Ni by comparing magnetization data taken at
|μ₀H| ≤ 60 mT below and above T_(c). While a ferromagnetic initial
magnetization curve is observed for T ≳ T_(c) [see magnetization data
for T = 5 K and 15 K in Fig. 3(c)], a Meissner phase with diamagnetic
field screening modified by the London penetration depth emerges at
temperatures below without any appearance of magnetic hysteresis effects
at |μ₀H| ≤ 60 mT [see data for T = 1.8 K in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)]. The
entire suppression of magnetic hysteresis in the Meissner phase is an
outstanding feature as the field penetration into the grains that have a
size comparable to the London penetration depth (∼200 nm) is evident. In
fact, a diamagnetic volume susceptibility of submicrometer Bi₃Ni of
∼−0.06 (compared to −1 for bulk material) observed at T = 1.8 K and
|μ₀H| ≤ 60 mT matches well with a calculation that considers field
penetration into submicrometer-sized crystallites on a length scale of
the London penetration depth, according to Ref. [25]. At fields beyond
60 mT, a ferromagnetic hysteresis loop emerges for submicrometer Bi₃Ni
that is superimposed and essentially broadened by the superconducting
state at T ≤ T_(c). To the best of our knowledge, such a definitive
appearance of superconductivity and ferromagnetic characteristics has
never been observed before in a single-phase material. The mutual
interplay with superconductivity enlarges the coercive field almost by a
factor of 4 to 300 mT [Fig. 3(c)]. This finding promotes speculations
that ferromagnetism and superconductivity correlate and mutually
consolidate each other. At high magnetic fields, the magnetizations of
submicrometer and nanostructured Bi₃Ni clearly differ. In nanostructured
Bi₃Ni, coercive field, remnant magnetization, and diamagnetic screening
are reduced, while magnetic moment and saturation field are clearly
increased [Fig. 3(b)]. Whereas the magnetization of submicrometer-sized
material saturates at |μ₀H| ≈ 1 T, with a small magnetic moment of
0.1μ_(B) per Ni atom, there is no indication of saturation in the
nanostructured representative up to 14 T where 0.8μ_(B) per Ni atom is
found [Fig. 3(b)]. We started to investigate the magnetic properties of
nanostructured Bi₃Ni further in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T where
a magnetic moment of ∼1.5μ_(B) per Ni atom is measured. Even up to these
fields, a full orientation of all Ni moments has not yet been realized
and further measurements to the more challenging field range above 60 T
are required. Quite obviously, the magnetic moment in randomly oriented
particles consisting of nanostructured 1D strands of molecular diameter
are much harder to polarize, presumably owing to a strong exchange and
shape anisotropy. Possibly, also the tighter hysteresis loop and the
smaller Curie temperature of nanostructured as compared to submicrometer
Bi₃Ni [see Fig. 3(a)] originates from that quasi-1D anisotropy.

For a proper determination of the superconducting upper critical field,
we have also performed measurements of the electrical resistivity of
nanostructured Bi₃Ni that has been moderately compacted to a granular
sponge consisting of nanoscaled fragments. Data have been taken at 0.4 K
 ≤ T ≤ 300 K and fields up to 14 T (see insets in Fig. 4). An _H-T_
phase diagram has been constructed by analyzing the R(T, H) curves for
characteristic values, $R(T,H)/R_{\rm max}(H)=10\%$ and 90

(red) and submicrometer Bi₃Ni (blue) as function of μ₀H at T = 1.8 K

fields up to 14 T (b). For submicrometer material, the evolution of the
magnetic hysteresis loop with temperature and its interference with
superconductivity at T ≤ T_(c) is shown (c). A fully reversible Meissner
state is present in submicrometer Bi₃Ni at |μ₀H| ≤ 60 mT (black open
squares and double arrow) at T = 1.8 K after ZFC (a).

raised owing to the reduced length scale, d ≪ ξ, where d is the diameter
of Bi₃Ni strands, ξ = (ϕ₀/2π μ₀H_(c2))^(1/2) is the superconducting
coherence length of bulk Bi₃Ni (ξ = 29 nm for μ₀H_(c2) = 0.4 T), and
ϕ₀ = h/2e Wb is the flux quantum. For confined superconductors, the
calculation of the critical field is modified to μ₀H_(c2) ≈ (ϕ₀/2π ξd).
For d ≈ 1 nm, this leads to μ₀H_(c2) ≈ 11 T for nanostructured Bi₃Ni,
which matches well with the experimental value. The maximum possible
critical field to break up Cooper pairs in the singlet state, however,
is given by the Zeeman energy. The corresponding theoretical
Chandrasekhar-Clogston or Pauli limit,[27] in simple approximation,
μ₀H_(P0)/T_(c) = 1.84 T/K, is exceeded in nanostructured Bi₃Ni where
μ₀H_(P0) = 9.6 T (Fig. 4). A reason for that might be the influence of a
strong spin-orbit scattering, which reduces paramagnetic pair breaking.
In that case, the simple approximation of the Pauli-limiting field has
to be replaced by μ₀H_(P) = 1.33(h/3π²k_(B)T_(c3))^(1/2)μ₀H_(P0), where
$\tau_{\rm SO}$ is the spin-orbit scattering time.[28] Also in several
other materials, e.g., heavy-fermion systems and organic
superconductors, large Maki parameters, 2^(1/2)H_(c2)/H_(P), have been
observed.[129] In two of them, the organic superconductor
κ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Cu(NCS)₂ and the heavy-fermion system CeCoIn₃,[30, 31]
strong evidence for the occurrence of the so-called
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductivity[32] and for CeCoIn₃ a
peculiar interplay between superconducting and magnetic ground states
have been found recently. In confined nanostructured Bi₃Ni, however,
Cooper pairs are even stable in an inhospitable internal magnetic
exchange field caused by the formation of ferromagnetic order, i.e.,
precisely the premise that has been taken by Fulde and Ferrell.[32] The
coexistence of superconductivity with ferromagnetic order would most
likely be possible in the case of spin-triplet pairing. The absence of
an inversion center of the lattice of confined Bi₃Ni would allow for the
formation of an antisymmetric spatial component of the electron-wave
function and could lead to a significant admixture of a triplet
component of the order parameter. However, as the lattice of bulk Bi₃Ni
is centrosymmetric, the question remains as to whether the loss of
structural long-range order at the surface of confined nanostructures
could induce antisymmetry of the charge carrier wave function. The
results, demonstrated in Fig. 4, in particular, the occurrence of a
high-field low-temperature reentrant phase, are a first hint that the
onset of the formation of Cooper pairs is linked to the magnetic ground
state of confined Bi₃Ni in a rather complex way.

In summary, superconducting and ferromagnetic material properties
evidently complement each other in confined Bi₃Ni structures.
Superconductivity emerges in the ferromagnetic phase and coexists in the
highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic state. With the application of
additional experimental techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance,
deeper insight in the symmetry of the superconducting wave function in k
space may be gained. In addition, the preparation and investigation of
Bi₃Ni and related compounds also in other sizes ranging from bulk to
nanostructured confined geometry will be informative.
