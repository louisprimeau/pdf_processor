###### Abstract

We have investigated the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the structure of orthorhombic La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 between 1 atm and 0.6 GPa, using neutron powder diffraction. Increasing pressure causes the tilt angle of CuO6 octahedra to decrease, leading to a transition to tetragonal symmetry. There is a strong compressibility anisotropy for the orthorhombic structure. Order parameters for the transition versus pressure are consistent with Landau theory for a second-order transition. It is shown that this transition can be universally scaled over (_x_,T,_P_) space in the context of Landau theory. We conclude that _T_c varies inversely with the tilt angle and is maximum for the tetragonal structure, i.e., for flat and square CuO2 planes, for this compound.

## I Introduction

The compound La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 offers one of the best opportunities for investigating the relationship between crystal structure and superconductivity. As a function of increasing strontium content, there is a transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry. Within the orthorhombic phase, the tilt angle of CuO6 octahedra depends on strontium content, varying smoothly to zero at the structural transition. The application of pressure also alters the tilt angle and produces the same structural transition at constant Sr content. Here we report the structural changes in orthorhombic La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 produced by the application of hydrostatic pressure. When combined with other work, these results allow clear conclusions to be drawn about the effects of varying the tilt angle and the transformation to tetragonal symmetry on superconductivity in this compound.

For La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4, bulk superconductivity is observed in the composition range 0.07 <= x <= 0.24. At low temperature (10-70 K) and ambient pressure, La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 has an orthorhombic structure with space group _Bmab_1,2 throughout most of this composition range (_x_ <= 0.21). For x >= 0.21, La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 has a tetragonal structure with space group _F4/mmm_.1,3 The orthorhombic-to-tetragonal (OT) transition line4-6 is shown in Fig. 1. Superconductivity is observed in orthorhombic and tetragonal samples. However, the superconducting critical temperature _T_c decreases rapidly as a function of x in the 0.21 < x < 0.24 composition range, and other superconducting properties, like the Meissner fraction, can be depressed as well. Therefore, it has been important to investigate whether superconductivity in the tetragonal phase is an intrinsic phenomenon or results from the presence of structural or compositional inhomogeneities. Based on the observation of an abrupt change in the Meissner signal at the OT transition, Takagi _et al._ concluded that the structural transition was responsible for the loss of superconductivity.4 However, in a similar experiment, Kitazawa _et al._ and Nagano _et al._ did not see any discontinuity in the Meissner signal, and concluded that bulk superconductivity exists in both the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases.8,9 In a recent study on powder samples,6 we presented structural and magnetic data which support the conclusions of Kitazawa and co-workers.

Measurements of the structural and superconducting properties at high pressure provide a means for investigating the issue of superconductivity in the tetragonal phase. It is known10-14 that pressure has a strong effect on the structural properties of this compound: For orthorhombic samples, the application of hydrostatic pressure reduces both the orthorhombic strain13 and the intensity of the characteristic _Bmab_ reflections,12 and ultimately induces a structural transition to the tetragonal phase. For example, at 39 K, the OT transition shifts from x = 0.206 at ambient pressure to x = 0.16 at 1.5 GPa.14 Pressure is not expected to strongly affect the

Measured points for the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition are shown as reported in Ref. 4 (_x_ symbols), Ref. 5 (_x_ symbols), and Ref. 6 (_x_ symbols). The line is a best fit [Eq. (5)] to the reported points.

 number of electronic carriers on the CuO_{2} planes of this compound, which is thought to be proportional to the strontium concentration x, since La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} does not have a "charge reservoir" layer that can exhibit a variable oxidation state as do the Cu-O chains in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. Therefore, a study of the structural and superconducting phase diagrams at various pressures should determine whether the change of crystal symmetry affects superconductivity. Recently, Yamada and Ido measured the _T_{C}_'s of several La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} samples (0.15 <= x <= 0.22) as a function of applied pressure (0 <= P <= 2 Gpa).[14] The OT phase transition temperature was also determined at each composition and pressure from the anomaly in the thermal expansion coefficient. Yamada and Ido established that _T_{C}_ increases with pressure in the orthorhombic phase, reaching the maximum value at the OT phase transition. They found that in the tetragonal phase, _T_{C}_ is essentially pressure independent. At 2 GPa, the shape of the _T_{C}_ vs x curve is similar to that at ambient pressure: The maximum _T_{C}_ is reached for x <= 0.15 [raised from 38 K (ambient pressure) to 42 K (2 GPa)], and superconductivity disappears for x > 0.24. This study indicates that the proximity of the low-temperature OT transition line and the disappearance of superconductivity at ambient pressure is essentially accidental, and can be removed by the application of pressure. In addition, the steplike discontinuity in _dT_{C}/dP_ (Ref. [14]) at the OT transition (which is unique among high-_T_{C}_ cuprates[15, 16]) suggests that the increase in _T_{C}_ with pressure in the orthorhombic phase may be related to a structural order parameter, which vanishes together with _dT_{C}/dP_ at the transition, where the "optimal" superconducting structure is attained.

This observation suggests that the correlation between crystal structure and electronic structure and its possible influence on the superconducting properties should be investigated. Using band-structure calculations, Norman _et al_. have recently shown[17] that small structural distortions of the type associated with tilts of the CuO_{6} octahedra in the orthorhombic structure do tend to lower the electronic density of states, but by only a small amount unless the tilt angle becomes large. They suggest, however, that such small changes may be sufficient to explain the observed pressure dependence of _T_{C}_. Clearly, detailed measurements of the structural parameters as a function of pressure are needed for a more quantitative analysis of the problem.

In this paper, we present structural refinements using neutron powder diffraction data for three measurements on orthorhombic samples [La_{2}CuO_{4} at 60 K (experiment 1) and 295 K (experiment 2) and La_{1.9}Sr_{0.1}CuO_{4} at 60 K (experiment 3), shown as points 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1] as a function of applied hydrostatic pressure (0 <= P < 0.6 GPa). The structural parameters are compared with those obtained for a tetragonal sample [La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} at 295 K (experiment 4), point 4 in Fig. 1] reported previously.[7] From the structural measurements, the variation of order parameters associated with the OT transition are calculated and compared with Landau theory. The pressure-induced OT transition appears to be a well-behaved second-order transition. Thus, these results confirm that the tetragonal structure, where the CuO_{6} octahedral tilt angle has been reduced to zero, displays the highest _T_{C}_ for the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system.

## II Experiment

La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (_x_ = 0.00, 0.10) powder samples were synthesized as described previously.[6] After synthesis, the x = 0.10 sample was annealed at 700 degC in flowing oxygen, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The x = 0.00 sample was annealed at 700 degC in flowing nitrogen, and then rapidly quenched to room temperature. These annealing conditions produce samples with oxygen contents close to 4.00.

Time-of-flight neutron powder-diffraction data were collected on the special environment powder diffractometer (SEPD) (Ref. [18]) at Argonne's intense pulsed neutron source (IPNS). The SEPD was equipped with a helium pressure cell[19] mounted on a 12-W closed-cycle refrigerator (Displex). This apparatus allows the temperature of the sample to be controlled between 60 K and room temperature with an accuracy of +-0.1 K. The pressure cell design allows data collection between 0 and 0.6 GPa at a fixed scattering angle of 2_th_ = +-90deg with no Bragg scattering from the cell. It also offers the advantage of perfectly hydrostatic conditions, precise pressure measurements, and the ability to change pressure and temperature without having to move the sample. A detailed description of the experimental apparatus has been given elsewhere.[19]

Three separate experiments, 1, 2, and 3, with x = 0.00 at 60 K, x = 0.00 at 295 K, and x = 0.10 at 60 K were performed (Fig. 1). The conditions x = 0.00 at 295 K and x = 0.10 at 60 K result in nominally equal orthorhombic strains at zero pressure (~1%) but for a nonsuperconducting composition in the former case and superconducting composition in the latter. For each experiment, data were collected for approximately 4 h per pressure, at seven different pressures from 1 atm to 0.6 GPa. The data were analyzed using the Rietveld technique, using the IPNS time-of-flight Rietveld code.[20] Refinements were carried out using the nonstandard _Bmab_ space group (isomorphous to the standard _Cmca_, No. 64),[1, 2] and included 304 Bragg reflections over a _d_-spacing range of 0.7 <= d <= 3.6 A. Scattering amplitudes used[21] were (in units of 10-12 cm) 0827, 0.702, 0.7718, and 0.5805 for La, Sr, Cu, and O, respectively. The refined parameters included the lattice constants, all variable atom positions, isotropic thermal parameters for all atoms, and three peak width parameters. The refined structural parameters for the three experiments are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3. A portion of the Rietveld profile for the La_{1.9}Sr_{0.1}CuO_{4} sample at 60 K (experiment 3) at 0.6 GPa is shown in Fig. 2.

## III Results and Discussion

The relative changes of the lattice parameters a, b, and c and of the cell volume V as a function of pressure for the three measurements on orthorhombic samples and for the previously studied tetragonal sample[7] are shown in Fig. 3. The average compressibilities and compressibility  anisotropies for all samples are given in Table 4. The three measurements in the orthorhombic phase yield similar compressibilities. The _a_-axis compressibilities, k_{a}, are comparable for the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures, while the _b_-axis compressibility, k_{b}, is a factor of ~2 larger for the orthorhombic structures, resulting in a decrease of the orthorhombic strain with pressure [Fig. 4(a)]. As a consequence, there is a large in-plane compressibility anisotropy (_k__b_/_k__a_) for the three orthorhombic structures (2.07, 1.96, 2.35) (Table 4), [while in-plane compressibility is isotropic (by symmetry) in the tetragonal phase]. It is interesting that the _c_-axis compressibilities adjust in such a way that the volume compressibilities are the same in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases [Table 4, Fig. 3(c)]. The orthorhombic strain and the square of the tilt angle decrease linearly

The corresponding points on the OT transition plane in the (_x_,P,_T_) space are (0, 7.2, 60), (0, 4.4, 295), and (0.1, 3.6, 60) in reasonable agreement with values extrapolated from published x-ray-diffraction results.11-13

Since the variation of T_{C} with pressure is markedly different for the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases14 it is important to ask whether there are significant differences in the compressions of individual bonds or the pressure dependence of other features. For the two superconducting compositions (experiments 3 and 4, Table 4) the compression of the apical, Cu-O(2), bond is larger for the tetragonal phase (experiment 4), which clearly disagrees with early attempts26,27 to correlate _dT__C_/_dP_ with compression of this bond. The compression of the inplane, Cu-O(1), bond (Table 4) is significantly larger for the orthorhombic phase. Thus, our data are qualitatively consistent with the compression of this bond being related to _dT__C_/_dP_. However, it is difficult to explain how _dT__C_/_dP_ decreases to zero (the data14 shows 0 < _dT__C_/_dP_ < 0.1 K/GPa) upon transforming to the tetragonal phase, since the Cu-O(1) bond compression decreases by only about 30%. The only structural feature that correlates fully with the behavior of T_{C} versus pressure is the tilt angle, which decreases with increasing pressure in the orthorhombic phase, and is (by symmetry) zero in the tetragonal phase.

The decrease of the tilt angle with increasing pressure is counter intuitive. If the CuO6 octahedra were rigid, one might expect that compression would be accommodated by coordinated tilting of the octahedra around their shared corners, but just the opposite occurs. Clearly, a full understanding of the unusual compression mechanism in orthorhombic La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 would require expressing the total energy as a function of cell volume in terms of individual atom positions. However, it is possible to understand the behavior in simple physical terms by considering the response of the CuO2 and La2O2 layers to pressure.

Structural transitions are a common feature of the lay

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c} P (GPa) & 0.000 & 0.100 & 0.200 & 0.301 & 0.409 & 0.510 & 0.605 \\ a (Å) & 5.3260(1) & 5.3249(1) & 5.3239(1) & 5.3229(1) & 5.3219(1) & 5.3212(1) & 5.3203(1) \\ b (Å) & 5.3713(1) & 5.3691(1) & 5.3668(1) & 5.3643(1) & 5  ered copper oxide superconductors resulting from the mismatch between the CuO_{2} layers and separating regions in the structure. In La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, if the Cu-O(1) bond becomes too long in the tetragonal structure, the resulting mismatch between the CuO_{2} layers and the La_{2}O_{2} layers leads to a phase transition to orthorhombic symmetry (see Fig. 5). Thus, reduction of heavily-doped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (by removing Sr) will lengthen the Cu-O(1) bond eventually leading to a lattice mismatch that is relieved by the transition to orthorhombic symmetry. The orthorhombic structure can accommodate a longer Cu-O(1) bond because of the additional degrees of freedom provided by the tilt and scissor distortion (the distortion of the equatorial plane of the octahedra which is a perfect square in the tetragonal phase and becomes rectangular in the orthorhombic phase). As a result, it is observed that the change in Cu-O(1) bond length on oxidation is considerably larger in the orthorhombic structure (-0.11 A/Sr atom) than in the tetragonal structure (-0.02 A/Sr atom).[6] Comparison of the compressibilities of the Cu-O(1) bonds in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases (Table 4 and Fig. 6) shows that Cu-O(1) bond compression is larger in the orthorhombic phase. Thus, the application of pressure is, in some sense, equivalent to adding Sr to the lattice. Both cause a reduction of the Cu-O(1) bond length with a resultant decrease of the tilt angle eventually leading to the tetragonal structure. Notice (Table 4) that \kappa_{a}<\kappa_{\rm Cu-O(1)}<\kappa_{b}, whereas, \kappa_{c}<\kappa_{\rm Cu-O(2)} [i.e., the Cu-O(2) bond length is softer than the lattice constant c].

It is also instructive to view the compression behavior in terms of the response of the La_{2}O_{2} layers. In the orthorhombic structure, the mismatch between the CuO_{2} and La_{2}O_{2} layers is accommodated by displacing the atoms in the La_{2}O_{2} plane [La and O(2)] to produce long and short La-O(2) bonds along the b axis (see Fig. 5). The long La-O(2) bonds essentially result from the existence of "extra space" in the La_{2}O_{2} layer. In the orthorhombic structure, compression is enhanced along the b axis because reduction of the b-axis lattice parameter simply results in a reduction of this "extra space;" i.e., along the b axis the unusually long La-O(2) bond does not resist compression to the same degree as do the La-O(2) bonds along the a axis. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 7, where the observed variation of La-O(2) bond distances with pressure is shown. With increasing pressure, the long La-O(2) bond decreases smoothly until it reaches a nominal value corresponding to the tetragonal phase [or corresponding to the La-O(2) bonds along the a axis in the orthorhombic phase]. At the same time, the short

Displacements of the O(1) atoms in the CuO_{2} planes follow those of the O(2) atoms in such a way that the CuO_{6} octahedra remain nearly rigid, leading to the concept of a tilt of the octahedra. The pressure-induced changes in the La_{2}O_{2} plane described above result in a decrease of the tilt angle with increasing pressure (Fig. 4).

Although the foregoing discussion gives a simple physical picture of the response of the structure to hydrostatic pressure, it is not adequate for describing the details of

Transition pressures, indicated by closed squares, as estimated by extrapolating the measured orthorhombic strain to zero (see text and Fig. 4). The La-O(2) bond length at this pressure is estimated by extrapolating the pressure dependence of the bonds nominally along the a axis (Fig. 5) that vary linearly with pressure.

  the transition quantitatively. A more sophisticated description is provided by comparing the observed structural changes with Landau theory. The structural phase transitions in La_{2-x}(Sr,Ba)_{x}CuO_{4} have been extensively analyzed in the framework of the Landau theory.[22]^{-}[25] In particular, Ting, Fossheim, and Laegreid specifically discussed the dependence of the OT structural phase transition on pressure and composition.[24] They concluded that the effect of either pressure or composition can be phenomenologically ascribed to the coupling between the strain field created by applying pressure or changing the chemical composition and the structural order parameter. We have already shown in previous work[6] that the behavior of both the orthorhombic strain and the octahedral tilt angle as a function of composition is in agreement with the predictions of the Landau theory. Landau theory predicts a linear variation of the orthorhombic strain and a quadratic variation of the tilt angle[22]^{-}[25] as a function of any external variable (composition, temperature, or pressure). The expected pressure dependence is seen in the present data (Fig. 4), although the pressure range is limited. This agreement suggests that it should be possible to compare data as a function of composition, temperature, or pressure as a function of an appropriate universal variable in the context of Landau theory.

The order parameter of the irreducible representation that describes the OT phase transition in La_{2-x}(Sr,Ba)_{x}CuO_{4} is an axial vector. The direction of the order parameter coincides with the tilt axis, while its magnitude is proportional to the tilt angle.[6]^{,}[22]^{-}[25] If we consider solely the _Bmab-F4/mmm_ phase transition (i.e., we ignore the possibility of other directions of the order parameter) the Landau excess free energy can be written to the fourth order as

\[\Delta F = - {{1\over 2}}c_{1}(T_{S} - T)\theta^{2} + c_{2}\theta^{4} + c_{3}\sigma\theta^{2} + {{1\over 2}}C_{66}\sigma^{2}\ .\]

Here \theta is the tilt angle, \sigma is the orthorhombic strain, C_{66} is the usual elastic constant, T_{s} is the phase transition temperature, and c_{1}, c_{2}, and c_{3} are constants. This expression is expected to be valid at intermediate temperatures, and can be extended to low temperature by replacing T and T_{s} with an "effective" temperature:

\[T \to T^{\bullet} = \Theta\coth\left[ {\Theta \over T} \right]\ ,\]

where \Theta has the dimension of a temperature and is related to the zero-point quantum fluctuations of the order parameter.[28] With the substitution in Eq. (2) we can model the low-temperature saturation of the quantities related to the order parameter (orthorhombic strain, tilt angles, etc.) and (as we shall see) the low-temperature behavior of the phase lines. Following the treatment of Ting and co-workers,[24] we can expand the effective critical temperature T_{S}^{\bullet} to first order in pressure and composition:

\[T_{S}^{\bullet} = T_{0}\left( {1 - {P \over P_{0}} - {x \over x_{0}}} \right)\ ,\]

where T_{0}, P_{0}, and x_{0} are constants to be determined. Inserting Eqs. (2) and (3) into (1) we obtain

\[\Delta F = - {{1\over 2}}c_{1}T_{0}\left[ {1 - {T^{\bullet} \over T_{0}} - {P \over P_{0}} - {x \over x_{0}}} \right]\theta^{2} + c_{2}\theta^{4}\]

\[+ c_{3}\sigma\theta^{2} + {{1\over 2}}C_{66}\sigma^{2}\ .\]

Equation (4) shows that, once \Theta, T_{0}, P_{0}, and x_{0} are determined, the phase transition can be completely described in terms of the "universal" parameter \xi = 1 - (T^{\bullet}/T_{0}) - (P/P_{0}) - (x/x_{0}). In particular, the phase transition surface in the (x,P,T) space is defined by the equation

\[\xi = 1 - {T^{\bullet} \over T_{0}} - {P \over P_{0}} - {x \over x_{0}} = 0\ .\]

Therefore, \Theta, T_{0}, P_{0}, and x_{0} can be obtained by fitting experimentally determined OT phase transition lines. Using various literature data,[4]^{-}[6] we have found a best fit to the OT phase transition line in the (x,T) plane at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 1). The refined values of the parameters varied in the fit are \Theta = 62(23) K, T_{0} = 557(9) K, and x_{0} = 0.236(7). From a similar fit of the phase transition line in the (x,P) plane at low temperature,[14] we have obtained P_{0} = 7.2(5) GPa. Equation (5) can be used to predict the position of the phase lines for other sections of the (x,P,T) space.

By minimizing the excess free energy in Eq. (4) as a function of \theta and \sigma, we obtain

\[\theta^{2} \propto \sigma \propto \xi\ .\]

Therefore, plots of the orthorhombic strain and of the square of the tilt angle versus the universal parameter \xi should be straight lines. In Fig. 8, the orthorhombic strain is plotted versus \xi for a variety of measurements, including, composition-dependent data,[6] temperature-dependent data,[29] and pressure-dependent data (present work). The plot well approximates a straight line, with only a small deviation from linearity at high values of \xi.

Figure 8: The orthorhombic strain versus the “universal” parameter, \xi (see text). The results of the present work are represented by open circles, squares, and diamonds (meaning as in Fig. 3). Results from the literature which were obtained at ambient pressure are designated as follows: with La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}(0 \leq x \leq 0.3) samples, (□)—10 K (Ref. 6), (■)—70 K (Ref. 6), (■)—295 K (Ref. 6), and (■)—a La_{2}CuO_{4} sample with 334 \leq T\leq 504 K (Ref. 27). The solid line represents a linear fit to the data.

  The data obtained in the pressure cell seem to display a small systematic upward shift, even at zero pressure. This small difference is likely due to the lower resolution of these data (from the 90^{\circ} detector bank) with respect to all other data (from the backscattering 145^{\circ} detector bank). In Fig. 9, the square of the tilt angle [as calculated from the apical oxygen O(2) displacement (Fig. 5)] is plotted versus the orthorhombic strain for the same data sets. The expected linear behavior is well reproduced at low temperature, but the tilt angle is higher than expected at higher temperatures. The simplest interpretation of this effect is as follows: Tilt angles are determined by the Rietveld method using both high-symmetry Bragg peaks (i.e., peaks that are allowed in both _Bmab_ and _F4/mmm_ space groups) and low-symmetry peaks (typical of _Bmab_). Low-symmetry peaks are mostly sensitive to the _coherent_ part of the displacements (which determines the mean-field order parameter), while high-symmetry peaks are equally sensitive to _coherent_ and _incoherent_ displacements. The incoherent displacements are expected to increase with increasing temperature, due to thermal fluctuations. In fact, the incoherent displacements could, in principle, be modeled using highly anharmonic temperature factors. Therefore, at high-temperature, full-profile Rietveld refinements should yield higher-than-expected values of the tilt angles.

## IV Conclusions

We see that the behavior of the order parameters in the (_x,P,T_) space, corresponds to a well-behaved second-order phase transition between the well-known orthorhombic and tetragonal phases. Hence, it is the tetragonal phase where T_{C} reaches its highest value. We therefore conclude that T_{C} increases while the octahedral tilt angle decreases in the orthorhombic phase, and reaches its maximum at the OT phase transition where the tilt angle goes to zero. In the tetragonal phase the tilt angle remains zero, and T_{C} remains constant. These conclusions suggest that perfectly flat and square CuO_{2} planes are the optimum structure for superconductivity.

###### Abstract

We have investigated the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the structure of orthorhombic La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 between 1 atm and 0.6 GPa, using neutron powder diffraction. Increasing pressure causes the tilt angle of CuO6 octahedra to decrease, leading to a transition to tetragonal symmetry. There is a strong compressibility anisotropy for the orthorhombic structure. Order parameters for the transition versus pressure are consistent with Landau theory for a second-order transition. It is shown that this transition can be universally scaled over (_x_,T,_P_) space in the context of Landau theory. We conclude that _T_c varies inversely with the tilt angle and is maximum for the tetragonal structure, i.e., for flat and square CuO2 planes, for this compound.

## I Introduction

The compound La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 offers one of the best opportunities for investigating the relationship between crystal structure and superconductivity. As a function of increasing strontium content, there is a transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry. Within the orthorhombic phase, the tilt angle of CuO6 octahedra depends on strontium content, varying smoothly to zero at the structural transition. The application of pressure also alters the tilt angle and produces the same structural transition at constant Sr content. Here we report the structural changes in orthorhombic La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 produced by the application of hydrostatic pressure. When combined with other work, these results allow clear conclusions to be drawn about the effects of varying the tilt angle and the transformation to tetragonal symmetry on superconductivity in this compound.

For La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4, bulk superconductivity is observed in the composition range 0.07 <= x <= 0.24. At low temperature (10-70 K) and ambient pressure, La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 has an orthorhombic structure with space group _Bmab_1,2 throughout most of this composition range (_x_ <= 0.21). For x >= 0.21, La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 has a tetragonal structure with space group _F4/mmm_.1,3 The orthorhombic-to-tetragonal (OT) transition line4-6 is shown in Fig. 1. Superconductivity is observed in orthorhombic and tetragonal samples. However, the superconducting critical temperature _T_c decreases rapidly as a function of x in the 0.21 < x < 0.24 composition range, and other superconducting properties, like the Meissner fraction, can be depressed as well. Therefore, it has been important to investigate whether superconductivity in the tetragonal phase is an intrinsic phenomenon or results from the presence of structural or compositional inhomogeneities. Based on the observation of an abrupt change in the Meissner signal at the OT transition, Takagi _et al._ concluded that the structural transition was responsible for the loss of superconductivity.4 However, in a similar experiment, Kitazawa _et al._ and Nagano _et al._ did not see any discontinuity in the Meissner signal, and concluded that bulk superconductivity exists in both the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases.8,9 In a recent study on powder samples,6 we presented structural and magnetic data which support the conclusions of Kitazawa and co-workers.

Measurements of the structural and superconducting properties at high pressure provide a means for investigating the issue of superconductivity in the tetragonal phase. It is known10-14 that pressure has a strong effect on the structural properties of this compound: For orthorhombic samples, the application of hydrostatic pressure reduces both the orthorhombic strain13 and the intensity of the characteristic _Bmab_ reflections,12 and ultimately induces a structural transition to the tetragonal phase. For example, at 39 K, the OT transition shifts from x = 0.206 at ambient pressure to x = 0.16 at 1.5 GPa.14 Pressure is not expected to strongly affect the

Measured points for the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition are shown as reported in Ref. 4 (_x_ symbols), Ref. 5 (_x_ symbols), and Ref. 6 (_x_ symbols). The line is a best fit [Eq. (5)] to the reported points.

 number of electronic carriers on the CuO_{2} planes of this compound, which is thought to be proportional to the strontium concentration x, since La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} does not have a "charge reservoir" layer that can exhibit a variable oxidation state as do the Cu-O chains in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. Therefore, a study of the structural and superconducting phase diagrams at various pressures should determine whether the change of crystal symmetry affects superconductivity. Recently, Yamada and Ido measured the _T_{C}_'s of several La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} samples (0.15 <= x <= 0.22) as a function of applied pressure (0 <= P <= 2 Gpa).[14] The OT phase transition temperature was also determined at each composition and pressure from the anomaly in the thermal expansion coefficient. Yamada and Ido established that _T_{C}_ increases with pressure in the orthorhombic phase, reaching the maximum value at the OT phase transition. They found that in the tetragonal phase, _T_{C}_ is essentially pressure independent. At 2 GPa, the shape of the _T_{C}_ vs x curve is similar to that at ambient pressure: The maximum _T_{C}_ is reached for x <= 0.15 [raised from 38 K (ambient pressure) to 42 K (2 GPa)], and superconductivity disappears for x > 0.24. This study indicates that the proximity of the low-temperature OT transition line and the disappearance of superconductivity at ambient pressure is essentially accidental, and can be removed by the application of pressure. In addition, the steplike discontinuity in _dT_{C}/dP_ (Ref. [14]) at the OT transition (which is unique among high-_T_{C}_ cuprates[15, 16]) suggests that the increase in _T_{C}_ with pressure in the orthorhombic phase may be related to a structural order parameter, which vanishes together with _dT_{C}/dP_ at the transition, where the "optimal" superconducting structure is attained.

This observation suggests that the correlation between crystal structure and electronic structure and its possible influence on the superconducting properties should be investigated. Using band-structure calculations, Norman _et al_. have recently shown[17] that small structural distortions of the type associated with tilts of the CuO_{6} octahedra in the orthorhombic structure do tend to lower the electronic density of states, but by only a small amount unless the tilt angle becomes large. They suggest, however, that such small changes may be sufficient to explain the observed pressure dependence of _T_{C}_. Clearly, detailed measurements of the structural parameters as a function of pressure are needed for a more quantitative analysis of the problem.

In this paper, we present structural refinements using neutron powder diffraction data for three measurements on orthorhombic samples [La_{2}CuO_{4} at 60 K (experiment 1) and 295 K (experiment 2) and La_{1.9}Sr_{0.1}CuO_{4} at 60 K (experiment 3), shown as points 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1] as a function of applied hydrostatic pressure (0 <= P < 0.6 GPa). The structural parameters are compared with those obtained for a tetragonal sample [La_{1.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{4} at 295 K (experiment 4), point 4 in Fig. 1] reported previously.[7] From the structural measurements, the variation of order parameters associated with the OT transition are calculated and compared with Landau theory. The pressure-induced OT transition appears to be a well-behaved second-order transition. Thus, these results confirm that the tetragonal structure, where the CuO_{6} octahedral tilt angle has been reduced to zero, displays the highest _T_{C}_ for the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system.

## II Experiment

La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (_x_ = 0.00, 0.10) powder samples were synthesized as described previously.[6] After synthesis, the x = 0.10 sample was annealed at 700 degC in flowing oxygen, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The x = 0.00 sample was annealed at 700 degC in flowing nitrogen, and then rapidly quenched to room temperature. These annealing conditions produce samples with oxygen contents close to 4.00.

Time-of-flight neutron powder-diffraction data were collected on the special environment powder diffractometer (SEPD) (Ref. [18]) at Argonne's intense pulsed neutron source (IPNS). The SEPD was equipped with a helium pressure cell[19] mounted on a 12-W closed-cycle refrigerator (Displex). This apparatus allows the temperature of the sample to be controlled between 60 K and room temperature with an accuracy of +-0.1 K. The pressure cell design allows data collection between 0 and 0.6 GPa at a fixed scattering angle of 2_th_ = +-90deg with no Bragg scattering from the cell. It also offers the advantage of perfectly hydrostatic conditions, precise pressure measurements, and the ability to change pressure and temperature without having to move the sample. A detailed description of the experimental apparatus has been given elsewhere.[19]

Three separate experiments, 1, 2, and 3, with x = 0.00 at 60 K, x = 0.00 at 295 K, and x = 0.10 at 60 K were performed (Fig. 1). The conditions x = 0.00 at 295 K and x = 0.10 at 60 K result in nominally equal orthorhombic strains at zero pressure (~1%) but for a nonsuperconducting composition in the former case and superconducting composition in the latter. For each experiment, data were collected for approximately 4 h per pressure, at seven different pressures from 1 atm to 0.6 GPa. The data were analyzed using the Rietveld technique, using the IPNS time-of-flight Rietveld code.[20] Refinements were carried out using the nonstandard _Bmab_ space group (isomorphous to the standard _Cmca_, No. 64),[1, 2] and included 304 Bragg reflections over a _d_-spacing range of 0.7 <= d <= 3.6 A. Scattering amplitudes used[21] were (in units of 10-12 cm) 0827, 0.702, 0.7718, and 0.5805 for La, Sr, Cu, and O, respectively. The refined parameters included the lattice constants, all variable atom positions, isotropic thermal parameters for all atoms, and three peak width parameters. The refined structural parameters for the three experiments are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3. A portion of the Rietveld profile for the La_{1.9}Sr_{0.1}CuO_{4} sample at 60 K (experiment 3) at 0.6 GPa is shown in Fig. 2.

## III Results and Discussion

The relative changes of the lattice parameters a, b, and c and of the cell volume V as a function of pressure for the three measurements on orthorhombic samples and for the previously studied tetragonal sample[7] are shown in Fig. 3. The average compressibilities and compressibility  anisotropies for all samples are given in Table 4. The three measurements in the orthorhombic phase yield similar compressibilities. The _a_-axis compressibilities, k_{a}, are comparable for the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures, while the _b_-axis compressibility, k_{b}, is a factor of ~2 larger for the orthorhombic structures, resulting in a decrease of the orthorhombic strain with pressure [Fig. 4(a)]. As a consequence, there is a large in-plane compressibility anisotropy (_k__b_/_k__a_) for the three orthorhombic structures (2.07, 1.96, 2.35) (Table 4), [while in-plane compressibility is isotropic (by symmetry) in the tetragonal phase]. It is interesting that the _c_-axis compressibilities adjust in such a way that the volume compressibilities are the same in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases [Table 4, Fig. 3(c)]. The orthorhombic strain and the square of the tilt angle decrease linearly

The corresponding points on the OT transition plane in the (_x_,P,_T_) space are (0, 7.2, 60), (0, 4.4, 295), and (0.1, 3.6, 60) in reasonable agreement with values extrapolated from published x-ray-diffraction results.11-13

Since the variation of T_{C} with pressure is markedly different for the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases14 it is important to ask whether there are significant differences in the compressions of individual bonds or the pressure dependence of other features. For the two superconducting compositions (experiments 3 and 4, Table 4) the compression of the apical, Cu-O(2), bond is larger for the tetragonal phase (experiment 4), which clearly disagrees with early attempts26,27 to correlate _dT__C_/_dP_ with compression of this bond. The compression of the inplane, Cu-O(1), bond (Table 4) is significantly larger for the orthorhombic phase. Thus, our data are qualitatively consistent with the compression of this bond being related to _dT__C_/_dP_. However, it is difficult to explain how _dT__C_/_dP_ decreases to zero (the data14 shows 0 < _dT__C_/_dP_ < 0.1 K/GPa) upon transforming to the tetragonal phase, since the Cu-O(1) bond compression decreases by only about 30%. The only structural feature that correlates fully with the behavior of T_{C} versus pressure is the tilt angle, which decreases with increasing pressure in the orthorhombic phase, and is (by symmetry) zero in the tetragonal phase.

The decrease of the tilt angle with increasing pressure is counter intuitive. If the CuO6 octahedra were rigid, one might expect that compression would be accommodated by coordinated tilting of the octahedra around their shared corners, but just the opposite occurs. Clearly, a full understanding of the unusual compression mechanism in orthorhombic La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 would require expressing the total energy as a function of cell volume in terms of individual atom positions. However, it is possible to understand the behavior in simple physical terms by considering the response of the CuO2 and La2O2 layers to pressure.

Structural transitions are a common feature of the lay

In La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}, if the Cu-O(1) bond becomes too long in the tetragonal structure, the resulting mismatch between the CuO_{2} layers and the La_{2}O_{2} layers leads to a phase transition to orthorhombic symmetry (see Fig. 5). Thus, reduction of heavily-doped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (by removing Sr) will lengthen the Cu-O(1) bond eventually leading to a lattice mismatch that is relieved by the transition to orthorhombic symmetry. The orthorhombic structure can accommodate a longer Cu-O(1) bond because of the additional degrees of freedom provided by the tilt and scissor distortion (the distortion of the equatorial plane of the octahedra which is a perfect square in the tetragonal phase and becomes rectangular in the orthorhombic phase). As a result, it is observed that the change in Cu-O(1) bond length on oxidation is considerably larger in the orthorhombic structure (-0.11 A/Sr atom) than in the tetragonal structure (-0.02 A/Sr atom).[6] Comparison of the compressibilities of the Cu-O(1) bonds in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases (Table 4 and Fig. 6) shows that Cu-O(1) bond compression is larger in the orthorhombic phase. Thus, the application of pressure is, in some sense, equivalent to adding Sr to the lattice. Both cause a reduction of the Cu-O(1) bond length with a resultant decrease of the tilt angle eventually leading to the tetragonal structure. Notice (Table 4) that \kappa_{a}<\kappa_{\rm Cu-O(1)}<\kappa_{b}, whereas, \kappa_{c}<\kappa_{\rm Cu-O(2)} [i.e., the Cu-O(2) bond length is softer than the lattice constant c].

It is also instructive to view the compression behavior in terms of the response of the La_{2}O_{2} layers. In the orthorhombic structure, the mismatch between the CuO_{2} and La_{2}O_{2} layers is accommodated by displacing the atoms in the La_{2}O_{2} plane [La and O(2)] to produce long and short La-O(2) bonds along the b axis (see Fig. 5). The long La-O(2) bonds essentially result from the existence of "extra space" in the La_{2}O_{2} layer. In the orthorhombic structure, compression is enhanced along the b axis because reduction of the b-axis lattice parameter simply results in a reduction of this "extra space;" i.e., along the b axis the unusually long La-O(2) bond does not resist compression to the same degree as do the La-O(2) bonds along the a axis. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 7, where the observed variation of La-O(2) bond distances with pressure is shown. With increasing pressure, the long La-O(2) bond decreases smoothly until it reaches a nominal value corresponding to the tetragonal phase [or corresponding to the La-O(2) bonds along the a axis in the orthorhombic phase]. At the same time, the short

Displacements of the O(1) atoms in the CuO_{2} planes follow those of the O(2) atoms in such a way that the CuO_{6} octahedra remain nearly rigid, leading to the concept of a tilt of the octahedra. The pressure-induced changes in the La_{2}O_{2} plane described above result in a decrease of the tilt angle with increasing pressure (Fig. 4).

Although the foregoing discussion gives a simple physical picture of the response of the structure to hydrostatic pressure, it is not adequate for describing the details of

Transition pressures, indicated by closed squares, as estimated by extrapolating the measured orthorhombic strain to zero (see text and Fig. 4). The La-O(2) bond length at this pressure is estimated by extrapolating the pressure dependence of the bonds nominally along the a axis (Fig. 5) that vary linearly with pressure. The solid lines represent parabolic fits passing through the zero-pressure and transition-pressure bond lengths. Error bars are smaller than the symbols.

  the transition quantitatively. A more sophisticated description is provided by comparing the observed structural changes with Landau theory. The structural phase transitions in La_{2-x}(Sr,Ba)_{x}CuO_{4} have been extensively analyzed in the framework of the Landau theory.[22]^{-}[25] In particular, Ting, Fossheim, and Laegreid specifically discussed the dependence of the OT structural phase transition on pressure and composition.[24] They concluded that the effect of either pressure or composition can be phenomenologically ascribed to the coupling between the strain field created by applying pressure or changing the chemical composition and the structural order parameter. We have already shown in previous work[6] that the behavior of both the orthorhombic strain and the octahedral tilt angle as a function of composition is in agreement with the predictions of the Landau theory. Landau theory predicts a linear variation of the orthorhombic strain and a quadratic variation of the tilt angle[22]^{-}[25] as a function of any external variable (composition, temperature, or pressure). The expected pressure dependence is seen in the present data (Fig. 4), although the pressure range is limited. This agreement suggests that it should be possible to compare data as a function of composition, temperature, or pressure as a function of an appropriate universal variable in the context of Landau theory.

The order parameter of the irreducible representation that describes the OT phase transition in La_{2-x}(Sr,Ba)_{x}CuO_{4} is an axial vector. The direction of the order parameter coincides with the tilt axis, while its magnitude is proportional to the tilt angle.[6]^{,}[22]^{-}[25] If we consider solely the _Bmab-F4/mmm_ phase transition (i.e., we ignore the possibility of other directions of the order parameter) the Landau excess free energy can be written to the fourth order as

\[\Delta F = - {{1\over 2}}c_{1}(T_{S} - T)\theta^{2} + c_{2}\theta^{4} + c_{3}\sigma\theta^{2} + {{1\over 2}}C_{66}\sigma^{2}\ .\]

Here \theta is the tilt angle, \sigma is the orthorhombic strain, C_{66} is the usual elastic constant, T_{s} is the phase transition temperature, and c_{1}, c_{2}, and c_{3} are constants. This expression is expected to be valid at intermediate temperatures, and can be extended to low temperature by replacing T and T_{s} with an "effective" temperature:

\[T \to T^{\bullet} = \Theta\coth\left[ {\Theta \over T} \right]\ ,\]

where \Theta has the dimension of a temperature and is related to the zero-point quantum fluctuations of the order parameter.[28] With the substitution in Eq. (2) we can model the low-temperature saturation of the quantities related to the order parameter (orthorhombic strain, tilt angles, etc.) and (as we shall see) the low-temperature behavior of the phase lines. Following the treatment of Ting and co-workers,[24] we can expand the effective critical temperature T_{S}^{\bullet} to first order in pressure and composition:

\[T_{S}^{\bullet} = T_{0}\left( {1 - {P \over P_{0}} - {x \over x_{0}}} \right)\ ,\]

where T_{0}, P_{0}, and x_{0} are constants to be determined. Inserting Eqs. (2) and (3) into (1) we obtain

\[\Delta F = - {{1\over 2}}c_{1}T_{0}\left[ {1 - {T^{\bullet} \over T_{0}} - {P \over P_{0}} - {x \over x_{0}}} \right]\theta^{2} + c_{2}\theta^{4}\]

\[+ c_{3}\sigma\theta^{2} + {{1\over 2}}C_{66}\sigma^{2}\ .\]

Equation (4) shows that, once \Theta, T_{0}, P_{0}, and x_{0} are determined, the phase transition can be completely described in terms of the "universal" parameter \xi = 1 - (T^{\bullet}/T_{0}) - (P/P_{0}) - (x/x_{0}). In particular, the phase transition surface in the (x,P,T) space is defined by the equation

\[\xi = 1 - {T^{\bullet} \over T_{0}} - {P \over P_{0}} - {x \over x_{0}} = 0\ .\]

Therefore, \Theta, T_{0}, P_{0}, and x_{0} can be obtained by fitting experimentally determined OT phase transition lines. Using various literature data,[4]^{-}[6] we have found a best fit to the OT phase transition line in the (x,T) plane at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 1). The refined values of the parameters varied in the fit are \Theta = 62(23) K, T_{0} = 557(9) K, and x_{0} = 0.236(7). From a similar fit of the phase transition line in the (x,P) plane at low temperature,[14] we have obtained P_{0} = 7.2(5) GPa. Equation (5) can be used to predict the position of the phase lines for other sections of the (x,P,T) space.

By minimizing the excess free energy in Eq. (4) as a function of \theta and \sigma, we obtain

\[\theta^{2} \propto \sigma \propto \xi\ .\]

Therefore, plots of the orthorhombic strain and of the square of the tilt angle versus the universal parameter \xi should be straight lines. In Fig. 8, the orthorhombic strain is plotted versus \xi for a variety of measurements, including, composition-dependent data,[6] temperature-dependent data,[29] and pressure-dependent data (present work). The plot well approximates a straight line, with only a small deviation from linearity at high values of \xi.

Figure 8: The orthorhombic strain versus the “universal” parameter, \xi (see text). The results of the present work are represented by open circles, squares, and diamonds (meaning as in Fig. 3). Results from the literature which were obtained at ambient pressure are designated as follows: with La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}(0 \leq x \leq 0.3) samples, (□)—10 K (Ref. 6), (■)—70 K (Ref. 6), (■)—295 K (Ref. 6), and (■)—a La_{2}CuO_{4} sample with 334 \leq T\leq 504 K (Ref. 27). The solid line represents a linear fit to the data.

  The data obtained in the pressure cell seem to display a small systematic upward shift, even at zero pressure. This small difference is likely due to the lower resolution of these data (from the 90^{\circ} detector bank) with respect to all other data (from the backscattering 145^{\circ} detector bank). In Fig. 9, the square of the tilt angle [as calculated from the apical oxygen O(2) displacement (Fig. 5)] is plotted versus the orthorhombic strain for the same data sets. The expected linear behavior is well reproduced at low temperature, but the tilt angle is higher than expected at higher temperatures. The simplest interpretation of this effect is as follows: Tilt angles are determined by the Rietveld method using both high-symmetry Bragg peaks (i.e., peaks that are allowed in both _Bmab_ and _F4/mmm_ space groups) and low-symmetry peaks (typical of _Bmab_). Low-symmetry peaks are mostly sensitive to the _coherent_ part of the displacements (which determines the mean-field order parameter), while high-symmetry peaks are equally sensitive to _coherent_ and _incoherent_ displacements. The incoherent displacements are expected to increase with increasing temperature, due to thermal fluctuations. In fact, the incoherent displacements could, in principle, be modeled using highly anharmonic temperature factors. Therefore, at high-temperature, full-profile Rietveld refinements should yield higher-than-expected values of the tilt angles.

## IV Conclusions

We see that the behavior of the order parameters in the (_x,P,T_) space, corresponds to a well-behaved second-order phase transition between the well-known orthorhombic and tetragonal phases. Hence, it is the tetragonal phase where T_{C} reaches its highest value. We therefore conclude that T_{C} increases while the octahedral tilt angle decreases in the orthorhombic phase, and reaches its maximum at the OT phase transition where the tilt angle goes to zero. In the tetragonal phase the tilt angle remains zero, and T_{C} remains constant. These conclusions suggest that perfectly flat and square CuO_{2} planes are the optimum structure for superconductivity.
