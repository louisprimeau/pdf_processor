###### Abstract

The homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} (n=1,2,3,4) is the newest and most promising of the layered high-T_{c} superconducting materials, as demonstrated in setting the highest T_{c} among the known superconducting materials. We slightly doped HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with Pb, producing HgBa_{2}Ca_{2-x}Pb_{x}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with T_{c} about 133 K. The Pb dopant helped material growth and still kept T_{c} close to that of the optimally doped HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}. The superconducting transition temperature as a function of pressure, T_{c}(P), was measured to 3 GPa. T_{c} increases monotonically with dT_{c}(P)/dP\approx 1.5 K/GPa near ambient pressure. The lattice parameters as a function of pressure were measured to 5 GPa. The volume decreases monotonically and is represented by an isothermal bulk modulus of B_{V}=143\pm 15 GPa. Both results were combined to produce T_{c}(V), which is readily comparable to theoretical models.

## I Introduction

The homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} (n=1,2,3,4) is the newest and most promising of the layered high-T_{c} superconducting materials with values of the transition temperature T_{c}\approx 94 K,[1] 127 K,[2] 134 K,[3] and 126 K,[4] respectively. It was found[5] that the irreversibility field H^{\star}(T) is significantly higher for HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} than for the two- and three-copper-layer Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O compounds, suggesting what is likely to be a significant improvement in technological applications. HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} (Hg1223) contains three Cu-O planes per unit cell and sets the highest T_{c}=134 K among the known high-temperature superconductors.

Knowing the superconducting transition temperature as a function of pressure, T_{c}(P), is important because that information can guide research directed at improving T_{c}(0).[6, 7] Several works have been reported on T_{c}(P) for Hg1223. Chu _et al._ reported that T_{c} at 135 K for Hg1223 increases monotonically above 150 K at 15 GPa.[8] Gao _et al._ reported that T_{c} for Hg1223 increased as high as 164 K under 30 GPa.[9] Ihara _et al._ found that T_{c} for Hg1223 has the maximum value of 156 K at 25 GPa.[10] These results open the possibility of finding a new material with T_{c} higher than 150 K, a temperature that can be maintained by conventional freon cooling technology.

According to these experiments,[8, 9, 10]T_{c} for Hg1223 varies at a rate of 1.0 K/GPa or less up to about 20 GPa. Those results, however, do not allow precise determination of dT_{c}(P)/dP in the low pressure range. Moreover, those experiments were performed under quasihydrostatic pressure conditions and pressure was not measured near T_{c}. Recently, Klehe _et al._ measured T_{c} to 0.9 GPa using a He-gas cell which ensured hydrostatic pressure and measured the pressure near T_{c},[11] They found that Hg1223 has dT_{c}(P)/dP=1.75 K/GPa, which is similar to that of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg1201) (Ref. [12]) and HgBa_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{6+\delta} (Hg1212).[11]

We have prepared HgBa_{2}Ca_{2-x}Pb_{x}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} (HgPb1223), T_{c} of which is about 133 K close to that of Hg1223. T_{c}(P) for HgPb1223 has not been reported yet. T_{c}(P) measurement in conjunction with V(P) leads to T_{c}(V), which helps in understanding the mechanism of superconductivity for new materials. We measured T_{c}(P) to 3 GPa and the lattice parameters to 5 GPa. We have found that the pressure derivative slightly decreases as pressure increases. For example, our value of dT_{c}(P)/dP for HgPb1223 is about 1.7 K/GPa to 1 GPa close to that for Hg1223 reported by Klehe _et al.[11]_ and about 1.14\pm 0.03 K/GPa to 3 GPa. The volume decreases monotonically producing an isothermal bulk modulus B_{V}=143\pm 15 GPa, which is larger than the value of 93 GPa for Hg1223 reported by Hunter _et al.[13]_ Combining our measured values of V(P) and T_{c}(P) leads to T_{c}(V), which can be readily compared with theoretical models.[14, 15] Specifically, the logarithmic volume derivative d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V is presented as a function of V/V_{0} where V_{0} is a volume at ambient pressure and is compared with those models.

## II Sample properties

HgPb1223 was grown by the usual solid state reaction technique. The growth procedures are detailed  elsewhere.[16] Among various materials made by the low pressure technique, several pieces of material from the same batch are used for this study. Figure 1 shows the resistance as a function of temperature, R(T). From room temperature to the superconducting transition temperature, R drops by a factor of about 2 demonstrating the metallic property. The onset temperature is about 133 K and the resistance reaches zero near 130 K. The onset temperature determined by resistance is slightly higher than that by the ac susceptibility due to the shielding effect that takes place when the resistance reaches zero.

The magnetic susceptibility was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design). Figure 2 shows the magnetic moment per unit mass, \chi_{m}(T). The sharp transition occurring around 130 K confirms superconductivity. In an external field H=15 Oe, the zero field cooling (ZFC) susceptibility amounts to -0.016 cm^{3}/g near 4 K. The x-ray density is \rho=6.2 g/cm^{3} according to the lattice parameters determined from our x-ray diffraction measurement. The actual density based on the measured size and mass is about 4.5 g/cm^{3} which is 73% of the x-ray density. Klehe _et al.[11]_ reported that the actual density for the polycrystalline Hg1223 was 60% of the x-ray density. If \rho is assumed to be 4.5 g/cm^{3} the equation \chi_{v}(T)=\rho\chi_{m}(T) yields -0.072. Based on this result, nearly 90% of the magnetic field is screened near 4 K. In the ZFC curve, the additional feature is seen around 90 K. After the sample was ground it disappeared indicating that it is largely due to the intergranular transition.[16] The field-cooling (FC) susceptibility reaches \sim20% of the maximum value of ZFC susceptibility. This value represents a lower-bound value for the true superconducting volume fraction in the sample, indicating the bulk nature of superconductivity. The FC susceptibility reaches \sim100% of its full low-temperature value within 20 K from onset T_{c}.

The x-ray diffraction patterns were obtained and the Rietveld refinement was performed using the General Structure Analysis System by Larson _et al.[17]_ The detailed results are reported elsewhere.[16] The results lead to a=3.8499(2) A and c=15.8491(18) A. Chmaissem _et al._ reported a=3.8502(1) A and c=15.7829(9) A from the neutron powder diffraction data for Hg1223.[18] Our c value is slightly larger than theirs. This may be due to the Pb atom present in our sample. The stoichiometry of Hg:Pb:Ba:Ca:Cu:O before reaction was 0.8:0.2:2.1:7.5:3:7.75. The composition of the grown sample was measured by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The composition ratios of Hg:Pb:Ba:Ca:Cu turned out to be 1.16(3):0.14(1):2.00:1.38(4):2.56(8) where the results were normalized with respect to two Ba atoms. It is commonly assumed that Pb substitutes on the Hg site.[19, 20, 21] According to EDX results it is unlikely that Pb partially occupies the Hg site. So, the Rietveld refinement was performed assuming that Pb could occupy any one of Hg, Ba, or Ca sites. R_{p} was lowest when Pb partially occupied the Ca site leading to HgBa_{2}Cu_{2.86}Ca_{1.73}Pb_{0.17}O_{8+\delta}.

The x-ray diffraction data reveal that the sample contains impurities and other defects. On the other hand, the R(T) and \chi_{m}(T) data indicate that the majority of the material contains a single superconducting phase. The role of Pb, however, remains unknown. Pb is initially introduced to help in growing Hg1223. The substitution of Pb into Hg1223 did not appear to affect the superconducting properties of Hg1223, since T_{c} remains same as that of Hg1223. \chi_{m}(T) for HgPb1223 is even better than those for Hg1223 by other groups[3, 18] in that the superconducting transition around 130 K is more clearly defined. In light of x-ray diffraction and EDX results, we imagine that Pb substitutes into the Ca site every other 10 unit cells. This may have been necessary to stabilize the atomic structure of Hg1223. The bulk modulus as a function of Pb composition may be able to answer this question. Additional studies of this phenomena between the structural stability and Pb doping are in progress.

## III Pressure Dependence on T_{c}

Our system for T_{c}(P) measurement has been described elsewhere.[22, 23] In this system, pressure is applied to the sample by the diamond anvil cell[24, 25] (DAC) at room

  temperature, but is determined near T_{e} by measuring the R_{1} and R_{2} fluorescence peaks from ruby chips inside the pressure cavity. The importance of _in situ_ pressure measurement has been demonstrated.[22, 23] Silicone oil was used as the pressure medium. The size of the sample was about 0.5\times 0.5\times 0.4 mm which ensures hydrostatic pressure inside the cylindrical pressure cavity whose diameter and thickness are 0.7 and 0.5 mm, respectively.

T_{c} is determined from the ac susceptibility, \chi(T)=\chi^{\prime}(T)+i\chi^{\prime\prime}(T).[26]\chi(T) is proportional to the voltage amplitude, V(T)=V^{\prime}(T)+iV^{\prime\prime}(T), of the compensating coils where the sample is located. So, V(T) is measured on increasing temperature at a rate of 0.6 K/min and on decreasing temperature at a rate of 2.5 K/min. The relatively small filling factor, although improved,[22] has a poor fraction of V(T) due to the sample superconductivity, V_{\rm sc}(T). Thus V_{\rm sc}(T) is extracted from V(T) by subtracting the background.[22] Figure 3 shows V_{\rm sc}(T)=V^{\prime}_{\rm sc}(T)+iV^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) on increasing temperature. The negative and positive values of the voltage correspond to V^{\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) and V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T), respectively. For clarity, only the data obtained at selected pressures of 0.00, 1.37, and 3.10 GPa are shown. V^{\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) shows the superconducting transition due to the intrinsic diamagnetic shielding above 130 K; its counterpart in V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) is too weak to be shown.[27] The peaks in V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) around 120 K are due to the coupling diamagnetic shielding between the grains. The peak height decreases and eventually dies away as pressure increases. The contacts between the grains probably improves at higher pressure and reduces the coupling loss. The information from V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T), however, is not sufficient to quantify due to other effects under pressure.

The transition width increases as pressure increases. This does not necessarily imply strong nonhydrostatic pressure, since the linewidth of the ruby fluorescence peaks did not show any sign of anomalous broadening, usually associated with uniaxial pressure, rather this may indicate the sample inhomogeneity or fragmentation. Due to the increase in the transition width, determination of T_{c}(P) depends on the points chosen for T_{c}. Goldfarb _et al.[26]_ discussed the disadvantage of using the midpoint. The width is also needed and these are field dependent, so they recommended the onset temperature as the correct (closest to intrinsic) T_{c}. For these reasons, T_{c} is taken to be the onset temperature for the results of T_{c}(P). In order to determine T_{c} systematically V^{\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) can be usually fitted by two flat and one straight line.[22] Due to a large hump below T_{c} the accurate determination of onset temperature was plausible when the data were fitted by the two flat and three straight lines,

\[f(T;h_{j},t_{j})=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}h_{1}&\mbox{for $T<t_{1}$}\\ a_{1}+b_{1}T&\mbox{for $t_{1}\leq T<t_{2}$}\\ a_{2}+b_{2}T&\mbox{for $t_{2}\leq T<t_{3}$}\\ a_{3}+b_{3}T&\mbox{for $t_{3}\leq T<t_{4}$}\\ h_{4}&\mbox{for $t_{4}\leq T$ ,}\end{array}\right.\] (1)

where b_{j}=(h_{j+1}-h_{j})/(t_{j+1}-t_{j}), a_{j}=h_{j}-b_{j}t_{j}, and j=1,2,3. From this fit, t_{4} is chosen to represent T_{c} for this study.

The solid squares in Fig. 4 show T_{c}(P) for HgPb1223. T_{c} for HgPb1223 at ambient pressure is 131.7\pm 0.2 K. The errors for T_{c} are on the order of 0.2 K based on the statistical error associated with the fitting[28] and are not shown in this figure. The errors slightly increase as pressure increases due to the reduced signal-to-noise ratio. Between the first at ambient pressure and the next point, T_{c} increases at a rate of 1.5 K/GPa, which is slightly less than 1.75 K/GPa for the homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} as reported by Klehe _et al.[11]_ The small difference may be due to the presence of the Pb atom. As pressure increases above 1 GPa, the rate slightly reduces. The slight change in the rate is understood in light of V(P) which also indicates the slower rate above 1 GPa (see Sec. IV). Above 2 GPa the rate remains nearly constant. The solid line is the linear fit fixing T_{c}(0) as given by the data. The fit yields dT_{c}(P)/dP=1.14\pm 0.03 K/GPa. This result is reproducible in that pressure effect on another sample yields the same pressure derivative. Notice that the pressure derivative depends on the pressure range. Clearly, cau

  tion must be exercised in referring to the pressure derivative.

Figure 4 also compares the current result with others. T_{c}(P) for Hg1201 in an earlier paper [29] is shown by the solid circles. The pressure derivative to 4.5 GPa was found to be 1.40\pm 0.03 K/GPa. Klehe _et al._ found that all of the pressure derivatives of Hg1201, Hg1212, and Hg1223 to 1 GPa are close to 1.75 K/GPa. Their results are reproduced by the solid diamonds in steps of 0.3 GPa. The pressure derivative between the point at ambient pressure and the next point of our results for Hg1201 is essentially the same as theirs. In light of their results, we also expect that the pressure derivatives of Hg1212 and Hg1223 may be similar to the pressure derivative of Hg1201 to higher pressure. dT_{c}(P)/dP for HgPb1223, however, is 1.14\pm 0.03 K/GPa up to 3 GPa which is slightly less than that for Hg1201. Work is in progress to see the effect of the Pb composition on the pressure derivative. The initial slope for HgPb1223 is still larger than those of superconducting RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}[30], where R refers to rare earth atoms with \delta\approx 0, except NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}[23].

It has been found that T_{c} for Hg1201, Hg1212, and Hg1223 increases monotonically to 4.5 GPa[29], 18 GPa[8], and 18 GPa[31], respectively, without showing any sign of decrease. A similar trend for Hg1223 to 23.5 GPa was observed by Nunez-Regueiro _et al._[32] Our result for HgPb1223 shows the similar trend to 3 GPa. On the other hand, Ihara _et al._ found that T_{c} for Hg1223 and the mixture of Hg1223 and Hg1234 have maxima at 13 GPa and 25 GPa, respectively.[10] In any case, T_{c}(P) for this series is different from that for other high-T_{c} superconducting materials such as RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}[30], Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}[33], and Tl_{2}Ba_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{10-\delta}[34], which show a change of sign in dT_{c}(P)/dP at pressures below 10 GPa. Wijngaarden _et al._ showed that T_{c}(P) for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} has a maximum at about 10 GPa, whereas T_{c}(P) for CaLaBaCu_{4}O_{8} shows a monotonic increase to 50 GPa[35]. In both materials the carrier concentration on the Cu-O plane, \delta_{\rm CuO} increases monotonically as pressure increases. The only difference is that d\delta_{\rm CuO}(P)/dP for YBa_{2-x}Cu_{4}O_{8} is greater than that for CaLaBaCu_{4}O_{8}. Perhaps \delta_{\rm CuO} for HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} increases more slowly, or possibly saturates to an optimal value at higher pressures.

## IV Pressure Effect on Volume

We carried out energy dispersive x-ray diffraction measurements [25] using the beam line X17C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. A Mao-Bell type DAC (Ref. [36]) was used to obtain high pressures. The pressure medium for this study was the same as for T_{c}(P) measurements. The pressure was measured in the same way as for T_{c}(P) measurements.

The sample was ground into a fine powder and loaded into a pressure cavity with a diameter of about 0.3 mm. Each energy dispersive diffraction spectra were obtained with an intrinsic Ge detector fixed at 2\theta angle. The diffraction angle, 2\theta, was calibrated by the energy dispersive diffraction spectrum for gold powder, which led to 2\theta = 13.037^{\circ}. The measurement period for each spectrum was 10 min. Figure 5 shows a spectrum taken at 5.13 GPa. Some peaks are from fluorescence of the constituent atoms excited by the incident x rays and others are due to the diffraction from the sample. The movements of the powder in the pressure cavity with changes in pressure cause the peak intensity to vary and in some cases caused it to disappear from one pressure to another. The seven peaks indexed in Fig. 5 appear consistently to the highest pressure and were used for the determination of lattice parameters. A spectrum analysis program was used to determine the peak position, intensity, I, and line width, \Gamma, for each spectrum. Based on these values the lattice parameters are determined by minimizing the weighted mean squared value[28],

\[\sigma^{2}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}w_{j}\left(\frac{1}{d_{\rm cal}^{2}}- \frac{1}{d_{\rm obs}^{2}}\right)^{2}\ ,\] (2)

where w_{j}\propto I/\Gamma, \sum_{j=1}^{N}w_{j}=N, and d is the interatomic planar spacing. Considering the fractional error, \sigma_{f}=\sum|d_{\rm cal}^{-2}-d_{\rm obs}^{-2}|/\sum d_{\rm obs}^{-2}, all of the data were fitted with \sigma_{f} varying from 1% to 6%.

Table I shows the resultant lattice parameters and volume at various pressures. We find a=3.8507(27) A and c=15.8423(124) A at ambient pressure and temperature. Considering the uncertainties these values are essentially the same as a=3.8499(2) A and c=15.8491(18) A obtained from the angular dispersive x-ray diffraction (see Sec. I). Figure 6 shows a/a_{0}, c/c_{0}, and V/V_{0} as a function of pressure to 10 GPa. For clarity, the error bars are drawn only for V/V_{0}. Their values can be fitted by the Murnaghan equation of state[37], which is rearranged and extended to

\[\alpha=\alpha_{0}\left(\frac{B_{\alpha}^{\prime}}{B_{\alpha}}P+1\right)^{- \frac{1}{\beta_{\alpha}^{\prime}}},\] (3)

Figure 5: Energy dispersive x-ray diffraction for the powdered HgBa_{2}CuCa_{2-x}Pb_{x}O_{8+\delta} at 5.13 GPa.

  where \alpha=a, c, or V, the subscript 0 indicates ambient pressure, B_{\alpha}=\partial\alpha/\alpha\partial P, and B^{\prime}_{\alpha}=\partial B_{\alpha}/\partial P. The solid lines in Fig. 6 show the resultant fit by Eq. (3).

Table 2 shows the corresponding values of B_{\alpha} and B^{\prime}_{\alpha}. The number of data in Table 1 is not sufficient to determine B^{\prime}_{\alpha} unambiguously and so the value of B^{\prime}_{\alpha} is fixed during the fit as indicated by the question mark (?) in the table. Our result reveals that \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a}=B_{a}/B_{c}=2.3. According to our result, the material is more compressible along the c axis than the a axis. This feature is similar to that of RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and unlike La_{2}CuO_{4} where \kappa_{a}\approx\kappa_{c}.[30] The compressibility of HgPb1223 has not been reported yet. Although the comparison of our results for HgPb1223 with others for Hg1223 may not be straightforward, the calculated results by Cornelius _et al.[38]_ for Hg1223 are listed in Table 2. The bulk modulus for HgPb1223 is B_{V}=143\pm 17 GPa. The bulk modulus for Hg1223 has been reported as 101 GPa,[38] 92.6 GPa,[13] and 82.6 \pm 10 GPa.[39] Assuming that B_{V} for Hg1223 is about 100 GPa, doping Hg1223 with Pb may have hardened Hg1223. In light of this result, HgPb1223 is structurally more stable than Hg1223.

We, however, want to be cautious in drawing such a conclusion since the experimental errors involved can prevent us from making such a direct comparison. We noticed the large discrepancy between our value of B_{V} and others. For example, our value of B_{V}=104 GPa[29] for Hg1201 is larger than B_{V}=69.4 GPa by Hunter _et al.[13]_ and B_{V}=65.4 GPa by Eggert _et al.[39]_ This kind of discrepancy has been shown in the literature with other materials.[30] To confirm whether HgPb1223 is harder than Hg1223, work is in progress to determine B_{V} as a function of the Pb composition.

## V. T_{c} as a function of volume

T_{c}(V) is more readily compared to theoretical model calculations than T_{c}(P), because T_{c}(V) relates T_{c} directly to the crystal structure. T_{c}(V) can be obtained from our data using T_{c}(P) and V(P). One method is to use Eq. (3) and values of B_{V} and B^{\prime}_{V} in Table 2. We have pointed out that a slight nonlinear variation is found around 2 GPa in the data for both T_{c}(P) and V(P). For this reason, we fitted the data of V(P) with the fourth order polynomial, fixing the initial position at ambient pressure. The result is used to calculate V for a given value of P. The solid squares in Fig. 7 are generated in this way. For comparison, the results are shown as a function of V/V_{0}. T_{c} monotonically increases with decreasing V/V_{0}. There is no sign of saturation or turnover up to the smallest volume achieved in this experiment. The solid line is a linear fit fixing T_{c}(V_{0}) as given. The fractional error is 0.3% indicating that T_{c} is very nearly linear to V.

The solid circles in Fig. 7 show T_{c}(V/V_{0}) for Hg1201.[22] The normalized volume derivative, dT_{c}(V/V_{0})/d(V/V_{0}), for HgPb1223 and Hg1223 is -186.6 K and -161.6 K, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, \Delta T_{c} for HgPb1223 is always _lower_ for a given amount of the pressure change than that for Hg1201. On the other hand, \Delta T_{c} for HgPb1223 is always _higher_ for a given amount of the normalized volume change than that for Hg1201. In view of this comparison we imagine that T_{c} for the three-layer system is more boosted for a given amount of change in the interlayer distance than that for a one-layer system assuming that the Cu-O interlayer compressibility is proportional to \kappa_{c}.

Several models for T_{c}(V) were reviewed by Wijngaar

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline P (GPa) & a(Å) & c(Å) & V(Å^{3}) & \sigma_{f} (\%) \\ \hline

\[\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\ln V}=\frac{V}{T_{c}}\frac{dT_{c}}{dV}\] (4)

at ambient pressure and compared it with experimental data. Our results shown in Fig. 7 can be transformed into d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V. One way is to differentiate Eq. (4) with respect to V. Another way is to perform the numerical differentiation over the T_{c}(V) data. Instead, we substitute dT_{c}/dV=-0.7945 into Eq. (4) and use the data for V and T_{c} to obtain d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V. This approach is a reasonable compromise between the pure analytical solution and pure numerical solution and does not require a direct use of the bulk modulus whose values differ from literature to literature. Figure 8 shows the results as a function of V/V_{0}. d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for HgPb1223 is in the order of -1.4 and increases linearly as T_{c} increases. The results are compared with d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for Hg1201.[22] The values for Hg1201 are lower than those for HgPb1223, but the slopes for these two different systems are equivalent within their combined uncertainty. Klehe _et al._ reported that all of d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for the homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} near the ambient pressure have same value of -1.2[11]. Our values are generally lower than theirs. Knowing that their values of T_{c}, V, and dT_{c}/dP are similar to ours, the discrepancy is mainly due to the difference in the bulk modulus.

Wijngaarden _et al._[14] noticed that the model based on BCS theory with electron-phonon interaction produced d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V\approx-2 which falls into the experimental value of superconducting materials with T_{c} above 90 K. They, however, concluded that the model was not sufficient to explain d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V of T_{c} at 40 K or 60 K at ambient pressure. On the other hand, BCS theory with a pairing mechanism other than phonons fits into a number of systems covering the range from T_{c}=30 K to 100 K at ambient pressure. We chose this model to compare with our data. Although their original intention was to compare d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V at ambient pressure with experimental results of different systems, we were interested in comparing this model with our data taken for the same system. The solid line in Fig. 9 is obtained from the model reproduced from the following equation:

\[\frac{\partial\ln T_{c}}{\partial\ln V}=\frac{\partial\ln\Delta E}{\partial\ln V }+\frac{\partial\lambda}{\partial\ln V}\ \left[1+\ln\left(\frac{k_{B}T_{c}}{ \Delta E}\right)^{2}\right],\] (5)

where \partial\ln\Delta E/\partial\ln V=2 and \partial\lambda/\partial\ln V=-10 as given,[14] except changing \Delta E/k_{B} from 500 K to 650 K. This variation was necessary to change the magnitude of d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V from about 1 to about -1.5 for comparison with our data. Still, the slope of our data is different from that of the model. In an attempt to compare our data of d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for Hg1201 with this model, we had to change \Delta E/k_{B} from 500 K to 450 K.[22] In light of this picture, the superconducting energy gap \Delta E of HgPb1223 appears greater than that of Hg1201. One, however, has to be aware of the large approximation involved in this analysis.

At this moment, we are not able to compare our experimental results of T_{c}(V) with other theoretical mod

  els, because we do not know the values of the parameters in those models. Another important measurement will be the determination of atomic positions as a function of pressure. Since the material is layered it is unknown whether the inter-layer compressibility is proportional to \kappa_{c}. We plan such measurements in the near future. These measurements will also tell us the change of \delta_{\rm Cu-O} plane as a function of volume. Consequently, T_{c} can be expressed as a function of \delta_{\rm Cu-O}.

## VI Conclusion

We have synthesized HgPb1223. Despite a small amount of Pb added to Hg1223, T_{c} remains the same as that of Hg1223. The x-ray diffraction data reveal only a single phase with apparent impurities and defects. The resistance and dc susceptibility measurements indicate a well-defined superconducting phase around 133 K. We have measured T_{c}(P) for HgPb1223 to 3 GPa. In the lower pressure range below 1 GPa, dT_{c}/dP is 1.5 K/GPa slightly less than 1.75 K/GPa for the homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} as established by Klehe _et al.[11]_ Assuming T_{c} is linear in P, dT_{c}/dP for HgPb1223 is found to be 1.14\pm 0.03 K/GPa to 3 GPa, which is slightly lower than 1.40\pm 0.03 K/GPa for HgPb1201 to 4.5 GPa.[22] We wish to determine T_{c} as well as dT_{c}/dP as a function of the Pb composition.

We have determined a(P), c(P), and V(P) for HgPb1223. \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a}=2.3 for HgPb1223 follows the trend of \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a}=3.0 for Hg1201,[22] but B_{V}=143\pm 15 GPa for HgPb1223 is larger by a factor of about 40% than B_{V}=104 of Hg1201.[22]B_{V}=143\pm 15 GPa for HgPb1223 is also larger than B_{V}=82.6\pm 10 GPa by Egger _et al.[39]_ We also pointed out the large discrepancies in the value of the bulk modulus between ours and others as pointed out earlier for other materials by Schilling _et al.[30]_ The difference may be due to the sample quality, pressure medium, and/or large uncertainties in the data.

We have produced T_{c}(V) for HgPb1223 from the measured values of T_{c}(P) and V(P). We have noticed that the pressure derivative of both T_{c}(P) and V(P) have a smaller value around 2 GPa. This, however, leads to T_{c}(V) which is _nearly linear_ to V (see Fig. 7). The results are shown as \Delta T_{c}(V/V_{0}) and compared with others. Although T_{c} for HgPb1223 increases slower than that for Hg1201 for a given pressure change, T_{c} for HgPb1223 increases faster than that for Hg1201 for a given change in the normalized volume. Thus three-layer systems appear to boost T_{c} more than one-layer systems for a given amount of change in the interlayer distance. This conclusion addresses the importance of combining T_{c}(P) and V(P) to produce T_{c}(V).

d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for HgPb1223 was generated as a function of V/V_{0} and was compared with others. d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V near ambient pressure is about -1.4 which is slightly larger than -1.5 for Hg1201. These values are lower than d\ln T_{c}/d\ln=-1.2 for the homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} as established by Klehe _et al.[11]_ The major discrepancy between ours and theirs is due to the difference in the bulk modulus used. Due to the large difference in the value of bulk modulus among the literatures, our d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V was generated without directly using the value of B_{V}. Based on their result, they concluded that the compounds in the homologous series are electronically (magnetically) similar and the same physical mechanism is responsible for the increase in T_{c} with pressure. The results of this investigation may call such a conclusion into a question, since we have shown that d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for Hg1201 is not exactly the same as that for HgPb1223.

Furthermore, d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for HgPb1223 was compared with the model based on the BCS-like theory with a pairing mechanism other than phonon-electron interaction. This model is unable to describe the experimental result even with variation of one input parameter. Further theoretical interpretation may be heeded. Many other models have been suggested in the past. We expect that our experimental results will help in refining those models.

###### Abstract

The homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} (n=1,2,3,4) is the newest and most promising of the layered high-T_{c} superconducting materials, as demonstrated in setting the highest T_{c} among the known superconducting materials. We slightly doped HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with Pb, producing HgBa_{2}Ca_{2-x}Pb_{x}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with T_{c} about 133 K. The Pb dopant helped material growth and still kept T_{c} close to that of the optimally doped HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}. The superconducting transition temperature as a function of pressure, T_{c}(P), was measured to 3 GPa. T_{c} increases monotonically with dT_{c}(P)/dP\approx 1.5 K/GPa near ambient pressure. The lattice parameters as a function of pressure were measured to 5 GPa. The volume decreases monotonically and is represented by an isothermal bulk modulus of B_{V}=143\pm 15 GPa. Both results were combined to produce T_{c}(V), which is readily comparable to theoretical models.

## I Introduction

The homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} (n=1,2,3,4) is the newest and most promising of the layered high-T_{c} superconducting materials with values of the transition temperature T_{c}\approx 94 K,[1] 127 K,[2] 134 K,[3] and 126 K,[4] respectively. It was found[5] that the irreversibility field H^{\star}(T) is significantly higher for HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} than for the two- and three-copper-layer Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O compounds, suggesting what is likely to be a significant improvement in technological applications. HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} (Hg1223) contains three Cu-O planes per unit cell and sets the highest T_{c}=134 K among the known high-temperature superconductors.

Knowing the superconducting transition temperature as a function of pressure, T_{c}(P), is important because that information can guide research directed at improving T_{c}(0).[6, 7] Several works have been reported on T_{c}(P) for Hg1223. Chu _et al._ reported that T_{c} at 135 K for Hg1223 increases monotonically above 150 K at 15 GPa.[8] Gao _et al._ reported that T_{c} for Hg1223 increased as high as 164 K under 30 GPa.[9] Ihara _et al._ found that T_{c} for Hg1223 has the maximum value of 156 K at 25 GPa.[10] These results open the possibility of finding a new material with T_{c} higher than 150 K, a temperature that can be maintained by conventional freon cooling technology.

According to these experiments,[8, 9, 10]T_{c} for Hg1223 varies at a rate of 1.0 K/GPa or less up to about 20 GPa. Those results, however, do not allow precise determination of dT_{c}(P)/dP in the low pressure range. Moreover, those experiments were performed under quasihydrostatic pressure conditions and pressure was not measured near T_{c}. Recently, Klehe _et al._ measured T_{c} to 0.9 GPa using a He-gas cell which ensured hydrostatic pressure and measured the pressure near T_{c},[11] They found that Hg1223 has dT_{c}(P)/dP=1.75 K/GPa, which is similar to that of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (Hg1201) (Ref. [12]) and HgBa_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{6+\delta} (Hg1212).[11]

We have prepared HgBa_{2}Ca_{2-x}Pb_{x}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} (HgPb1223), T_{c} of which is about 133 K close to that of Hg1223. T_{c}(P) for HgPb1223 has not been reported yet. T_{c}(P) measurement in conjunction with V(P) leads to T_{c}(V), which helps in understanding the mechanism of superconductivity for new materials. We measured T_{c}(P) to 3 GPa and the lattice parameters to 5 GPa. We have found that the pressure derivative slightly decreases as pressure increases. For example, our value of dT_{c}(P)/dP for HgPb1223 is about 1.7 K/GPa to 1 GPa close to that for Hg1223 reported by Klehe _et al.[11]_ and about 1.14\pm 0.03 K/GPa to 3 GPa. The volume decreases monotonically producing an isothermal bulk modulus B_{V}=143\pm 15 GPa, which is larger than the value of 93 GPa for Hg1223 reported by Hunter _et al.[13]_ Combining our measured values of V(P) and T_{c}(P) leads to T_{c}(V), which can be readily compared with theoretical models.[14, 15] Specifically, the logarithmic volume derivative d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V is presented as a function of V/V_{0} where V_{0} is a volume at ambient pressure and is compared with those models.

## II Sample properties

HgPb1223 was grown by the usual solid state reaction technique. The growth procedures are detailed  elsewhere.[16] Among various materials made by the low pressure technique, several pieces of material from the same batch are used for this study. Figure 1 shows the resistance as a function of temperature, R(T). From room temperature to the superconducting transition temperature, R drops by a factor of about 2 demonstrating the metallic property. The onset temperature is about 133 K and the resistance reaches zero near 130 K. The onset temperature determined by resistance is slightly higher than that by the ac susceptibility due to the shielding effect that takes place when the resistance reaches zero.

The magnetic susceptibility was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design). Figure 2 shows the magnetic moment per unit mass, \chi_{m}(T). The sharp transition occurring around 130 K confirms superconductivity. In an external field H=15 Oe, the zero field cooling (ZFC) susceptibility amounts to -0.016 cm^{3}/g near 4 K. The x-ray density is \rho=6.2 g/cm^{3} according to the lattice parameters determined from our x-ray diffraction measurement. The actual density based on the measured size and mass is about 4.5 g/cm^{3} which is 73% of the x-ray density. Klehe _et al.[11]_ reported that the actual density for the polycrystalline Hg1223 was 60% of the x-ray density. If \rho is assumed to be 4.5 g/cm^{3} the equation \chi_{v}(T)=\rho\chi_{m}(T) yields -0.072. Based on this result, nearly 90% of the magnetic field is screened near 4 K. In the ZFC curve, the additional feature is seen around 90 K. After the sample was ground it disappeared indicating that it is largely due to the intergranular transition.[16] The field-cooling (FC) susceptibility reaches \sim20% of the maximum value of ZFC susceptibility. This value represents a lower-bound value for the true superconducting volume fraction in the sample, indicating the bulk nature of superconductivity. The FC susceptibility reaches \sim100% of its full low-temperature value within 20 K from onset T_{c}.

The x-ray diffraction patterns were obtained and the Rietveld refinement was performed using the General Structure Analysis System by Larson _et al.[17]_ The detailed results are reported elsewhere.[16] The results lead to a=3.8499(2) A and c=15.8491(18) A. Chmaissem _et al._ reported a=3.8502(1) A and c=15.7829(9) A from the neutron powder diffraction data for Hg1223.[18] Our c value is slightly larger than theirs. This may be due to the Pb atom present in our sample. The stoichiometry of Hg:Pb:Ba:Ca:Cu:O before reaction was 0.8:0.2:2.1:7.5:3:7.75. The composition of the grown sample was measured by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The composition ratios of Hg:Pb:Ba:Ca:Cu turned out to be 1.16(3):0.14(1):2.00:1.38(4):2.56(8) where the results were normalized with respect to two Ba atoms. It is commonly assumed that Pb substitutes on the Hg site.[19, 20, 21] According to EDX results it is unlikely that Pb partially occupies the Hg site. So, the Rietveld refinement was performed assuming that Pb could occupy any one of Hg, Ba, or Ca sites. R_{p} was lowest when Pb partially occupied the Ca site leading to HgBa_{2}Cu_{2.86}Ca_{1.73}Pb_{0.17}O_{8+\delta}.

The x-ray diffraction data reveal that the sample contains impurities and other defects. On the other hand, the R(T) and \chi_{m}(T) data indicate that the majority of the material contains a single superconducting phase. The role of Pb, however, remains unknown. Pb is initially introduced to help in growing Hg1223. The substitution of Pb into Hg1223 did not appear to affect the superconducting properties of Hg1223, since T_{c} remains same as that of Hg1223. \chi_{m}(T) for HgPb1223 is even better than those for Hg1223 by other groups[3, 18] in that the superconducting transition around 130 K is more clearly defined. In light of x-ray diffraction and EDX results, we imagine that Pb substitutes into the Ca site every other 10 unit cells. This may have been necessary to stabilize the atomic structure of Hg1223. The bulk modulus as a function of Pb composition may be able to answer this question. Additional studies of this phenomena between the structural stability and Pb doping are in progress.

## III Pressure Dependence on T_{c}

Our system for T_{c}(P) measurement has been described elsewhere.[22, 23] In this system, pressure is applied to the sample by the diamond anvil cell[24, 25] (DAC) at room

Figure 1: Resistance for the polycrystalline HgBa_{2}Ca_{2-x}Pb_{x}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} at ambient pressure.

  temperature, but is determined near T_{e} by measuring the R_{1} and R_{2} fluorescence peaks from ruby chips inside the pressure cavity. The importance of _in situ_ pressure measurement has been demonstrated.[22, 23] Silicone oil was used as the pressure medium. The size of the sample was about 0.5\times 0.5\times 0.4 mm which ensures hydrostatic pressure inside the cylindrical pressure cavity whose diameter and thickness are 0.7 and 0.5 mm, respectively.

T_{c} is determined from the ac susceptibility, \chi(T)=\chi^{\prime}(T)+i\chi^{\prime\prime}(T).[26]\chi(T) is proportional to the voltage amplitude, V(T)=V^{\prime}(T)+iV^{\prime\prime}(T), of the compensating coils where the sample is located. So, V(T) is measured on increasing temperature at a rate of 0.6 K/min and on decreasing temperature at a rate of 2.5 K/min. The relatively small filling factor, although improved,[22] has a poor fraction of V(T) due to the sample superconductivity, V_{\rm sc}(T). Thus V_{\rm sc}(T) is extracted from V(T) by subtracting the background.[22] Figure 3 shows V_{\rm sc}(T)=V^{\prime}_{\rm sc}(T)+iV^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) on increasing temperature. The negative and positive values of the voltage correspond to V^{\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) and V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T), respectively. For clarity, only the data obtained at selected pressures of 0.00, 1.37, and 3.10 GPa are shown. V^{\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) shows the superconducting transition due to the intrinsic diamagnetic shielding above 130 K; its counterpart in V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) is too weak to be shown.[27] The peaks in V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) around 120 K are due to the coupling diamagnetic shielding between the grains. The peak height decreases and eventually dies away as pressure increases. The contacts between the grains probably improves at higher pressure and reduces the coupling loss. The information from V^{\prime\prime}_{\rm sc}(T), however, is not sufficient to quantify due to other effects under pressure.

The transition width increases as pressure increases. This does not necessarily imply strong nonhydrostatic pressure, since the linewidth of the ruby fluorescence peaks did not show any sign of anomalous broadening, usually associated with uniaxial pressure, rather this may indicate the sample inhomogeneity or fragmentation. Due to the increase in the transition width, determination of T_{c}(P) depends on the points chosen for T_{c}. Goldfarb _et al.[26]_ discussed the disadvantage of using the midpoint. The width is also needed and these are field dependent, so they recommended the onset temperature as the correct (closest to intrinsic) T_{c}. For these reasons, T_{c} is taken to be the onset temperature for the results of T_{c}(P). In order to determine T_{c} systematically V^{\prime}_{\rm sc}(T) can be usually fitted by two flat and one straight line.[22] Due to a large hump below T_{c} the accurate determination of onset temperature was plausible when the data were fitted by the two flat and three straight lines,

\[f(T;h_{j},t_{j})=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}h_{1}&\mbox{for $T<t_{1}$}\\ a_{1}+b_{1}T&\mbox{for $t_{1}\leq T<t_{2}$}\\ a_{2}+b_{2}T&\mbox{for $t_{2}\leq T<t_{3}$}\\ a_{3}+b_{3}T&\mbox{for $t_{3}\leq T<t_{4}$}\\ h_{4}&\mbox{for $t_{4}\leq T$ ,}\end{array}\right.\] (1)

where b_{j}=(h_{j+1}-h_{j})/(t_{j+1}-t_{j}), a_{j}=h_{j}-b_{j}t_{j}, and j=1,2,3. From this fit, t_{4} is chosen to represent T_{c} for this study.

The solid squares in Fig. 4 show T_{c}(P) for HgPb1223. T_{c} for HgPb1223 at ambient pressure is 131.7\pm 0.2 K. The errors for T_{c} are on the order of 0.2 K based on the statistical error associated with the fitting[28] and are not shown in this figure. The errors slightly increase as pressure increases due to the reduced signal-to-noise ratio. Between the first at ambient pressure and the next point, T_{c} increases at a rate of 1.5 K/GPa, which is slightly less than 1.75 K/GPa for the homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} as reported by Klehe _et al.[11]_ The small difference may be due to the presence of the Pb atom. As pressure increases above 1 GPa, the rate slightly reduces. The slight change in the rate is understood in light of V(P) which also indicates the slower rate above 1 GPa (see Sec. IV). Above 2 GPa the rate remains nearly constant. The solid line is the linear fit fixing T_{c}(0) as given by the data. The fit yields dT_{c}(P)/dP=1.14\pm 0.03 K/GPa. This result is reproducible in that pressure effect on another sample yields the same pressure derivative. Notice that the pressure derivative depends on the pressure range. Clearly, cau

  tion must be exercised in referring to the pressure derivative.

Figure 4 also compares the current result with others. T_{c}(P) for Hg1201 in an earlier paper [29] is shown by the solid circles. The pressure derivative to 4.5 GPa was found to be 1.40\pm 0.03 K/GPa. Klehe _et al._ found that all of the pressure derivatives of Hg1201, Hg1212, and Hg1223 to 1 GPa are close to 1.75 K/GPa. Their results are reproduced by the solid diamonds in steps of 0.3 GPa. The pressure derivative between the point at ambient pressure and the next point of our results for Hg1201 is essentially the same as theirs. In light of their results, we also expect that the pressure derivatives of Hg1212 and Hg1223 may be similar to the pressure derivative of Hg1201 to higher pressure. dT_{c}(P)/dP for HgPb1223, however, is 1.14\pm 0.03 K/GPa up to 3 GPa which is slightly less than that for Hg1201. Work is in progress to see the effect of the Pb composition on the pressure derivative. The initial slope for HgPb1223 is still larger than those of superconducting RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}[30], where R refers to rare earth atoms with \delta\approx 0, except NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}[23].

It has been found that T_{c} for Hg1201, Hg1212, and Hg1223 increases monotonically to 4.5 GPa[29], 18 GPa[8], and 18 GPa[31], respectively, without showing any sign of decrease. A similar trend for Hg1223 to 23.5 GPa was observed by Nunez-Regueiro _et al._[32] Our result for HgPb1223 shows the similar trend to 3 GPa. On the other hand, Ihara _et al._ found that T_{c} for Hg1223 and the mixture of Hg1223 and Hg1234 have maxima at 13 GPa and 25 GPa, respectively.[10] In any case, T_{c}(P) for this series is different from that for other high-T_{c} superconducting materials such as RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}[30], Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}[33], and Tl_{2}Ba_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{10-\delta}[34], which show a change of sign in dT_{c}(P)/dP at pressures below 10 GPa. Wijngaarden _et al._ showed that T_{c}(P) for YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} has a maximum at about 10 GPa, whereas T_{c}(P) for CaLaBaCu_{4}O_{8} shows a monotonic increase to 50 GPa[35]. In both materials the carrier concentration on the Cu-O plane, \delta_{\rm CuO} increases monotonically as pressure increases. The only difference is that d\delta_{\rm CuO}(P)/dP for YBa_{2-x}Cu_{4}O_{8} is greater than that for CaLaBaCu_{4}O_{8}. Perhaps \delta_{\rm CuO} for HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} increases more slowly, or possibly saturates to an optimal value at higher pressures.

## IV Pressure Effect on Volume

We carried out energy dispersive x-ray diffraction measurements [25] using the beam line X17C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. A Mao-Bell type DAC (Ref. [36]) was used to obtain high pressures. The pressure medium for this study was the same as for T_{c}(P) measurements. The pressure was measured in the same way as for T_{c}(P) measurements.

The sample was ground into a fine powder and loaded into a pressure cavity with a diameter of about 0.3 mm. Each energy dispersive diffraction spectra were obtained with an intrinsic Ge detector fixed at 2\theta angle. The diffraction angle, 2\theta, was calibrated by the energy dispersive diffraction spectrum for gold powder, which led to 2\theta = 13.037^{\circ}. The measurement period for each spectrum was 10 min. Figure 5 shows a spectrum taken at 5.13 GPa. Some peaks are from fluorescence of the constituent atoms excited by the incident x rays and others are due to the diffraction from the sample. The movements of the powder in the pressure cavity with changes in pressure cause the peak intensity to vary and in some cases caused it to disappear from one pressure to another. The seven peaks indexed in Fig. 5 appear consistently to the highest pressure and were used for the determination of lattice parameters. A spectrum analysis program was used to determine the peak position, intensity, I, and line width, \Gamma, for each spectrum. Based on these values the lattice parameters are determined by minimizing the weighted mean squared value[28],

\[\sigma^{2}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}w_{j}\left(\frac{1}{d_{\rm cal}^{2}}- \frac{1}{d_{\rm obs}^{2}}\right)^{2}\ ,\] (2)

where w_{j}\propto I/\Gamma, \sum_{j=1}^{N}w_{j}=N, and d is the interatomic planar spacing. Considering the fractional error, \sigma_{f}=\sum|d_{\rm cal}^{-2}-d_{\rm obs}^{-2}|/\sum d_{\rm obs}^{-2}, all of the data were fitted with \sigma_{f} varying from 1% to 6%.

Table I shows the resultant lattice parameters and volume at various pressures. We find a=3.8507(27) A and c=15.8423(124) A at ambient pressure and temperature. Considering the uncertainties these values are essentially the same as a=3.8499(2) A and c=15.8491(18) A obtained from the angular dispersive x-ray diffraction (see Sec. I). Figure 6 shows a/a_{0}, c/c_{0}, and V/V_{0} as a function of pressure to 10 GPa. For clarity, the error bars are drawn only for V/V_{0}. Their values can be fitted by the Murnaghan equation of state[37], which is rearranged and extended to

\[\alpha=\alpha_{0}\left(\frac{B_{\alpha}^{\prime}}{B_{\alpha}}P+1\right)^{- \frac{1}{\beta_{\alpha}^{\prime}}},\] (3)

Figure 5: Energy dispersive x-ray diffraction for the powdered HgBa_{2}CuCa_{2-x}Pb_{x}O_{8+\delta} at 5.13 GPa.

  where \alpha=a, c, or V, the subscript 0 indicates ambient pressure, B_{\alpha}=\partial\alpha/\alpha\partial P, and B^{\prime}_{\alpha}=\partial B_{\alpha}/\partial P. The solid lines in Fig. 6 show the resultant fit by Eq. (3).

Table 2 shows the corresponding values of B_{\alpha} and B^{\prime}_{\alpha}. The number of data in Table 1 is not sufficient to determine B^{\prime}_{\alpha} unambiguously and so the value of B^{\prime}_{\alpha} is fixed during the fit as indicated by the question mark (?) in the table. Our result reveals that \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a}=B_{a}/B_{c}=2.3. According to our result, the material is more compressible along the c axis than the a axis. This feature is similar to that of RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and unlike La_{2}CuO_{4} where \kappa_{a}\approx\kappa_{c}.[30] The compressibility of HgPb1223 has not been reported yet. Although the comparison of our results for HgPb1223 with others for Hg1223 may not be straightforward, the calculated results by Cornelius _et al.[38]_ for Hg1223 are listed in Table 2. The bulk modulus for HgPb1223 is B_{V}=143\pm 17 GPa. The bulk modulus for Hg1223 has been reported as 101 GPa,[38] 92.6 GPa,[13] and 82.6 \pm 10 GPa.[39] Assuming that B_{V} for Hg1223 is about 100 GPa, doping Hg1223 with Pb may have hardened Hg1223. In light of this result, HgPb1223 is structurally more stable than Hg1223.

We, however, want to be cautious in drawing such a conclusion since the experimental errors involved can prevent us from making such a direct comparison. We noticed the large discrepancy between our value of B_{V} and others. For example, our value of B_{V}=104 GPa[29] for Hg1201 is larger than B_{V}=69.4 GPa by Hunter _et al.[13]_ and B_{V}=65.4 GPa by Eggert _et al.[39]_ This kind of discrepancy has been shown in the literature with other materials.[30] To confirm whether HgPb1223 is harder than Hg1223, work is in progress to determine B_{V} as a function of the Pb composition.

## V. T_{c} as a function of volume

T_{c}(V) is more readily compared to theoretical model calculations than T_{c}(P), because T_{c}(V) relates T_{c} directly to the crystal structure. T_{c}(V) can be obtained from our data using T_{c}(P) and V(P). One method is to use Eq. (3) and values of B_{V} and B^{\prime}_{V} in Table 2. We have pointed out that a slight nonlinear variation is found around 2 GPa in the data for both T_{c}(P) and V(P). For this reason, we fitted the data of V(P) with the fourth order polynomial, fixing the initial position at ambient pressure. The result is used to calculate V for a given value of P. The solid squares in Fig. 7 are generated in this way. For comparison, the results are shown as a function of V/V_{0}. T_{c} monotonically increases with decreasing V/V_{0}. There is no sign of saturation or turnover up to the smallest volume achieved in this experiment. The solid line is a linear fit fixing T_{c}(V_{0}) as given. The fractional error is 0.3% indicating that T_{c} is very nearly linear to V.

The solid circles in Fig. 7 show T_{c}(V/V_{0}) for Hg1201.[22] The normalized volume derivative, dT_{c}(V/V_{0})/d(V/V_{0}), for HgPb1223 and Hg1223 is -186.6 K and -161.6 K, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, \Delta T_{c} for HgPb1223 is always _lower_ for a given amount of the pressure change than that for Hg1201. On the other hand, \Delta T_{c} for HgPb1223 is always _higher_ for a given amount of the normalized volume change than that for Hg1201. In view of this comparison we imagine that T_{c} for the three-layer system is more boosted for a given amount of change in the interlayer distance than that for a one-layer system assuming that the Cu-O interlayer compressibility is proportional to \kappa_{c}.

Several models for T_{c}(V) were reviewed by Wijngaar

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline P (GPa) & a(Å) & c(Å) & V(Å^{3}) & \sigma_{f} (\%) \\ \hline
0.00 & 3.8507(27) & 15.8423(124) & 234.91(0.52) & 4 \\
1.03 & 3.8439(25) & 15.7762(298) & 233.11(0.74) & 4 \\
2.33 & 3.8406(42) & 15.7237(305) & 231.92(0.96) & 5 \\

\[\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\ln V}=\frac{V}{T_{c}}\frac{dT_{c}}{dV}\] (4)

at ambient pressure and compared it with experimental data. Our results shown in Fig. 7 can be transformed into d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V. One way is to differentiate Eq. (4) with respect to V. Another way is to perform the numerical differentiation over the T_{c}(V) data. Instead, we substitute dT_{c}/dV=-0.7945 into Eq. (4) and use the data for V and T_{c} to obtain d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V. This approach is a reasonable compromise between the pure analytical solution and pure numerical solution and does not require a direct use of the bulk modulus whose values differ from literature to literature. Figure 8 shows the results as a function of V/V_{0}. d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for HgPb1223 is in the order of -1.4 and increases linearly as T_{c} increases. The results are compared with d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for Hg1201.[22] The values for Hg1201 are lower than those for HgPb1223, but the slopes for these two different systems are equivalent within their combined uncertainty. Klehe _et al._ reported that all of d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for the homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} near the ambient pressure have same value of -1.2[11]. Our values are generally lower than theirs. Knowing that their values of T_{c}, V, and dT_{c}/dP are similar to ours, the discrepancy is mainly due to the difference in the bulk modulus.

Wijngaarden _et al._[14] noticed that the model based on BCS theory with electron-phonon interaction produced d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V\approx-2 which falls into the experimental value of superconducting materials with T_{c} above 90 K. They, however, concluded that the model was not sufficient to explain d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V of T_{c} at 40 K or 60 K at ambient pressure. On the other hand, BCS theory with a pairing mechanism other than phonons fits into a number of systems covering the range from T_{c}=30 K to 100 K at ambient pressure. We chose this model to compare with our data. Although their original intention was to compare d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V at ambient pressure with experimental results of different systems, we were interested in comparing this model with our data taken for the same system. The solid line in Fig. 9 is obtained from the model reproduced from the following equation:

\[\frac{\partial\ln T_{c}}{\partial\ln V}=\frac{\partial\ln\Delta E}{\partial\ln V }+\frac{\partial\lambda}{\partial\ln V}\ \left[1+\ln\left(\frac{k_{B}T_{c}}{ \Delta E}\right)^{2}\right],\] (5)

where \partial\ln\Delta E/\partial\ln V=2 and \partial\lambda/\partial\ln V=-10 as given,[14] except changing \Delta E/k_{B} from 500 K to 650 K. This variation was necessary to change the magnitude of d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V from about 1 to about -1.5 for comparison with our data. Still, the slope of our data is different from that of the model. In an attempt to compare our data of d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for Hg1201 with this model, we had to change \Delta E/k_{B} from 500 K to 450 K.[22] In light of this picture, the superconducting energy gap \Delta E of HgPb1223 appears greater than that of Hg1201. One, however, has to be aware of the large approximation involved in this analysis.

At this moment, we are not able to compare our experimental results of T_{c}(V) with other theoretical mod

  els, because we do not know the values of the parameters in those models. Another important measurement will be the determination of atomic positions as a function of pressure. Since the material is layered it is unknown whether the inter-layer compressibility is proportional to \kappa_{c}. We plan such measurements in the near future. These measurements will also tell us the change of \delta_{\rm Cu-O} plane as a function of volume. Consequently, T_{c} can be expressed as a function of \delta_{\rm Cu-O}.

## VI Conclusion

We have synthesized HgPb1223. Despite a small amount of Pb added to Hg1223, T_{c} remains the same as that of Hg1223. The x-ray diffraction data reveal only a single phase with apparent impurities and defects. The resistance and dc susceptibility measurements indicate a well-defined superconducting phase around 133 K. We have measured T_{c}(P) for HgPb1223 to 3 GPa. In the lower pressure range below 1 GPa, dT_{c}/dP is 1.5 K/GPa slightly less than 1.75 K/GPa for the homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} as established by Klehe _et al.[11]_ Assuming T_{c} is linear in P, dT_{c}/dP for HgPb1223 is found to be 1.14\pm 0.03 K/GPa to 3 GPa, which is slightly lower than 1.40\pm 0.03 K/GPa for HgPb1201 to 4.5 GPa.[22] We wish to determine T_{c} as well as dT_{c}/dP as a function of the Pb composition.

We have determined a(P), c(P), and V(P) for HgPb1223. \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a}=2.3 for HgPb1223 follows the trend of \kappa_{c}/\kappa_{a}=3.0 for Hg1201,[22] but B_{V}=143\pm 15 GPa for HgPb1223 is larger by a factor of about 40% than B_{V}=104 of Hg1201.[22]B_{V}=143\pm 15 GPa for HgPb1223 is also larger than B_{V}=82.6\pm 10 GPa by Egger _et al.[39]_ We also pointed out the large discrepancies in the value of the bulk modulus between ours and others as pointed out earlier for other materials by Schilling _et al.[30]_ The difference may be due to the sample quality, pressure medium, and/or large uncertainties in the data.

We have produced T_{c}(V) for HgPb1223 from the measured values of T_{c}(P) and V(P). We have noticed that the pressure derivative of both T_{c}(P) and V(P) have a smaller value around 2 GPa. This, however, leads to T_{c}(V) which is _nearly linear_ to V (see Fig. 7). The results are shown as \Delta T_{c}(V/V_{0}) and compared with others. Although T_{c} for HgPb1223 increases slower than that for Hg1201 for a given pressure change, T_{c} for HgPb1223 increases faster than that for Hg1201 for a given change in the normalized volume. Thus three-layer systems appear to boost T_{c} more than one-layer systems for a given amount of change in the interlayer distance. This conclusion addresses the importance of combining T_{c}(P) and V(P) to produce T_{c}(V).

d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for HgPb1223 was generated as a function of V/V_{0} and was compared with others. d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V near ambient pressure is about -1.4 which is slightly larger than -1.5 for Hg1201. These values are lower than d\ln T_{c}/d\ln=-1.2 for the homologous series HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} as established by Klehe _et al.[11]_ The major discrepancy between ours and theirs is due to the difference in the bulk modulus used. Due to the large difference in the value of bulk modulus among the literatures, our d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V was generated without directly using the value of B_{V}. Based on their result, they concluded that the compounds in the homologous series are electronically (magnetically) similar and the same physical mechanism is responsible for the increase in T_{c} with pressure. The results of this investigation may call such a conclusion into a question, since we have shown that d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for Hg1201 is not exactly the same as that for HgPb1223.

Furthermore, d\ln T_{c}/d\ln V for HgPb1223 was compared with the model based on the BCS-like theory with a pairing mechanism other than phonon-electron interaction. This model is unable to describe the experimental result even with variation of one input parameter. Further theoretical interpretation may be heeded. Many other models have been suggested in the past. We expect that our experimental results will help in refining those models.
