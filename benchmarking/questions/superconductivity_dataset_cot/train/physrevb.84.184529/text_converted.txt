###### Abstract

Two superconducting phases of Re₃W have been found with different
physical properties. One phase crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric
cubic (α-Mn) structure and has a superconducting transition temperature
T_(c) of 7.8 K. The other phase has a hexagonal centrosymmetric
structure and is superconducting with a T_(c) of 9.4 K. Switching
between the two phases is possible by annealing the sample or remelting
it. The properties of both phases of Re₃W have been characterized by
powder neutron diffraction, magnetization, and resistivity measurements.
The temperature dependences of the lower and upper critical fields have
been measured for both phases. These are used to determine the
penetration depths and the coherence lengths for these systems.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) heavy
fermion CePt₃Si (Ref. [1]) has resulted in a period of intense
theoretical and experimental investigation into the physics of
noncentrosymmetric superconducting materials. The lack of inversion
symmetry in the crystal structure of this type of material along with
strong spin-orbit (SO) coupling can lead to a mixing of spin-singlet and
spin-triplet pair states.[2] These NCS materials exhibit unusual
magnetic properties including suppressed paramagnetic limiting or high
upper critical fields [3, 4] as seen in CePt₃Si,[1] CeRhSi₃,[5] and
CeIrSi₃,[6] the appearance of superconductivity with antiferromagnet
order in CePt₃Si,[7] and superconductivity at the border of
ferromagnetism in UIr.[8]

One recent focus of the work on noncentrosymmetric superconductors has
been to investigate the properties of transition-metal compounds that
have a significant spin-orbit coupling. Here, the complications of the
f-electron heavy fermions, such as the strong electron correlations and
the possibility of magnetically mediated superconductivity, are expected
to be absent. The intermetallic Re₃W belongs in this category since it
contains heavy atoms with atomic numbers 75 and 74 for Re and W,
respectively. Superconductivity in Re₃W was first reported in the
1960’s. The material was shown to have a cubic α-Mn structure,[9, 10]
although it is worth noting that the authors of this early work did not
comment on the fact that the α-Mn structure is noncentrosymmetric. Since
then, very little experimental work has been done on Re₃W. Recent
penetration depth measurements carried out on the NCS phase of Re₃W by
rf tunnel diode resonator and point-contact spectroscopy suggested that
Re₃W is a weakly coupled isotropic s-wave superconductor.[11, 12, 13]

In this paper, we report on the synthesis of two different
superconducting phases of Re₃W. One phase has a centrosymmetric (CS)
crystal structure, whereas the other has a noncentrosymmetric structure.
Switching from the CS to the NCS phase is achieved by annealing the
sample, while remelting the NCS sample in an arc furnace returns the
sample to the CS structure. The ease with which one can switch between
the two phases of Re₃W has allowed us to investigate and compare the
properties of a CS and a NCS superconducting system using a single
material without changes in stoichiometry. We characterize the
properties of both phases of Re₃W using neutron diffraction,
magnetization M, and resistivity ρ measurements. We present the
temperature dependence of the lower critical field, H_(c1), and the
upper critical field, H_(c2), of both materials and also calculate the
penetration depths and coherence lengths for these systems.

## III Results and discussion

### Powder neutron diffraction studies

Time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction data were collected on the
General Materials Diffractometer (GEM) at the ISIS facility in the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK.[14] The data were normalized to the
incident neutron flux distribution and corrected for detector
efficiencies and detector solid angle coverage, with the diffraction
patterns collected in the highest resolution backscattering detector
bank (average 2θ = 154^(∘)) used for structure refinement. Crystal
structures were refined by the Rietveld method using the expgui
graphical interface for the gsas package.[15, 16] Figure 1 shows the
diffraction patterns collected at 295 K from the annealed and unannealed
samples of Re₃W. The Rietveld refinement shows that the annealed sample
has a cubic NCS (α-Mn) structure (space group $I\bar{4}3m$) with a
lattice parameter a = 9.5987(7) A [see Fig. 1(a)]. The diffraction
pattern of the unannealed sample shows that this sample has a hexagonal
structure with the CS space group P6₃/mmc and lattice parameters a =
2.770(3) A and c = 4.5207(6) A [see Fig. 1(b)]. The diffraction patterns
of both phases of Re₃W contain some peaks (denoted by asterisks) that
cannot be indexed, and these regions were excluded during the final
stages of structure refinement. Insets of Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) show the
crystal structures of the NCS and the CS phases of Re₃W. For the CS
phase of Re₃W, both the Re and the W atoms share the same site, leading
to a random distribution of Re and W within the material. For the NCS
phase, the refinement indicates that Re and the W atoms occupy preferred
crystallographic sites and are therefore distributed in a more orderly
fashion within the material. The refined composition of the NCS phase is
not stoichiometric indicating there is still some uncertainty in the
site occupation. Crystallographic parameters of the two phases of Re₃W
are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

### Magnetization and resistivity measurements

Magnetization measurements were made as a function temperature in an
applied magnetic field of 20 Oe using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property
Measurement System (MPMS) magnetometer. The temperature dependence of
the dc magnetic susceptibility, $\chi_{\rm dc}(T)$, shows that the NCS
Re₃W sample has a superconducting transition temperature,
$T_{c}^{\rm onset}$, of 7.8 K (see Fig. 2) with a transition width
ΔT_(c) = 0.21 K. For CS Re₃W, the onset of the transition is around 9.4
K with a much broader transition of ΔT_(c) = 0.50 K. Comparable
transition widths are observed in the resistivity measurements (see
below). This suggests, as expected, that the annealed NCS phase of Re₃W
is more ordered than the unannealed CS phase. At 2 K, the
zero-field-cooled (ZFC) dc susceptibility approaches a value of −1 (∼100

The ac electrical resistivity was measured as a function of temperature,
ρ(T), for both phases of Re₃W via a standard four-probe method using a
Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) (see Fig. 3).
The NCS Re₃W shows a superconducting transition (onset) at 7.85 K
(ΔT_(c) = 0.05 K) while the CS Re₃W has a transition at 9.45 K
(ΔT_(c) = 0.32 K). The zero-field onset transition temperatures
determined from the resistivity measurements are slightly higher than
those obtained from the magnetization measurements performed in 20 Oe.

calculated pattern obtained from a Rietveld refinement of the structure
and a difference curve. The ticks indicate positions of the nuclear
Bragg peaks. The green asterisks mark the positions of impurity peaks.
The Rietveld refinement shows that the annealed sample has a
noncentrosymmetric cubic structure while the unannealed sample has a
centrosymmetric hexagonal structure. Insets show the crystal structures
of the two phases, with the Re atoms shown in red (light gray) and the W
atoms shown in blue (dark gray).

between 2 and 295 K show metallic behavior for the CS phase of Re₃W,
whereas it is almost temperature independent above T_(c) in the NCS
phase of Re₃W (see the inset of Fig. 3). The relative resistance ratio
ρ(295K)/ρ(10K) and the room temperature resistivity are 1.15(1) and
1.7μΩ m for the NCS phase and 1.52(1) and 2.1μΩ m for the CS phase,
indicating that both samples are poor metals. The NCS phase is the more
brittle of the two materials and any extrinsic factors such as
microscopic cracks in the sample are more likely to play a role in this
material. Given that the room temperature resistivity of the NCS sample
is lower than the CS phase we suggest that cracks are not the reason for
the high normal-state resistivity. The poor conductivity is more likely
to result from a combination of strong electronic scattering and a large
temperature-independent residual resistivity due to structural disorder
(while the NCS annealed phase is structurally more ordered than the CS
phase, the NCS phase still retains a degree of Re/W disorder). We have
calculated the mean free path, l_(tr), based on the BCS approach [17]
using the room temperature resistivity data. The calculations yield
l_(tr)^(NCS) = 0.277 nm and l_(tr)^(CS) = 0.224 nm. These values are
comparable with the size of the crystallographic unit cells and given
the coherence lengths ξ, derived below, indicate that both phases of
Re₃W are in the dirty limit.

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the low-field virgin magnetization data for
the NCS and CS phases of Re₃W at 1.8 K and Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) show the
full magnetization versus applied magnetic field loops collected in the
superconducting state at 1.8 K. For the NCS sample the raw M(H) data
contain a significant paramagnetic contribution. This contribution

Table 3: Measured and derived superconducting and transport parameters
of the noncentrosymmetric and centrosymmetric phases of Re₃W.

Figure 7: (Color online) Temperature variation of the resistivity in a
set of magnetic fields from 0 to 90 kOe for the (a) NCS and (b) CS
phases of Re₃W. Temperature dependence of the upper critical fields of
the (c) NCS and (d) CS phases of Re₃W. The solid line in (c) is a fit to
the data using the WHH model. The solid line in (d) is a fit to the data
using H_(c2)(T) = H_(c2)(0)[1 − (T/T_(c))^(3/2)]^(3/2).
