###### Abstract

The anisotropic upper critical field, H_(c2)(T), curves for
K_(0.83)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ are determined over a wide range of temperatures
down to 1.5 K and magnetic fields up to 60 T. Anisotropic initial slopes
of H_(c2) ∼ −1.4 T/K and −4.6 T/K for magnetic field applied along c
axis and ab plane, respectively, were observed. Whereas the c axis
H_(c2)^(c) (T) increases quasilinearly with decreasing temperature, the
ab plane H_(c2)^(c)(T) shows a flattening, starting near 25 K above 30
T. This leads to a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the anisotropy
parameter γ_(H) = H_(c2)^(ab)/H_(c2)^(c). The anisotropy parameter
γ_(H) ∼ 3.6 around 27 K. For lower temperatures, γ_(H) decreases with T
in a linear fashion, dropping to γ_(H) ∼ 2.5 by T ∼ 18 K. Despite the
apparent differences between the K_(0.83)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ and
(Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45))Fe₂As₂ or Ba(Fe_(0.932)Co_(0.973))₂As₂, in terms of
the magnetic state and proximity to an insulating state, the H_(c2)(T)
curves are remarkably similar.

REVIEW B **83**, 100514(R) (2011)

Since the discovery of superconductivity in the FeAs-based family,
intensive research efforts have focused on finding Fe-based
superconductors with a higher transition temperature, T_(c), and
clarifying the pairing mechanism of superconductivity.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
As additional families have been discovered, the Fe-based
superconductors have been categorized into several types including 11
type (P4/mmm, FeSe), 122 type (I4/mmm, AF₂As₂, = K, Sr, Ba), and 111
type (P4/mmm, RFFeAsO, R= rare earth). Among these, FeSe is a simple
binary system with T_(c) ∼ 8 K that can be increased up to 37 K by
external pressure.[7] Very recently, higher T_(c) values (>30 K) were
successfully achieved by adding A (K, Rb, Cs, and Tl)[8, 9, 10, 11]
between the Fe₂Se₂ layers, changing the structure from the 11 type
(P4/mmm) to the 122 type (I4/mmm). The discovery of superconductivity in
K_(1 − x)Fe_(2 − x)Se_(x)[8] materials with the same ThCr₂Si₂ crystal
structure as BaFe₂As₂ has given rise to a multitude of measurements,
theories, and questions. Even with the dramatically different transport
properties (much closer to semiconducting in temperature dependence and
absolute value) and magnetic states (antiferromagnetism existing up to
above 500 K in samples that superconduct near 30 K)[12, 13, 14, 15] as
compared to superconducting samples of doped BaFe₂As₂, the measured
magnetic and transport anisotropy is modest[16] and T_(c) values are
comparable to K- and Co-doped members of the BaFe₂As₂ family. With these
conspicuous differences, and clear similarities, it is of interest to
establish the anisotropic upper critical field, H_(c2)(T), curves to see
if they are similar to or different from those found in the
isostructural FeAs-based 122-type materials. In this communication,
high-magnetic-field measurements of radiofrequency (rf) contactless
penetration depth into the mixed state are presented and the anisotropic
H_(c2) curves for K_(0.83)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ are inferred. These results are
compared with our earlier measurements of the anisotropic H_(c2)(T)
curves for K- and Co-doped BaFe₂As₂[17, 18, 19, 20].

The single crystals of K_(0.83)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ were grown from a high
temperature melt and the actual composition was determined using
wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS). Details of sample growth
and characterization are given in Ref. [16]. The temperature and
magnetic-field dependences of the electrical resistance were measured
using the four-probe ac (f = 16 Hz) technique in a Physical Property
Measurement System (Quantum Design). To investigate the upper
critical-field anisotropy to higher fields (H ≤ 60 T), the
magnetic-field dependence of radiofrequency (rf) contactless penetration
depth was measured for applied field both parallel (H ∥ c) and
perpendicular (H ∥ ab) to the tetragonal c axis. The rf contactless
penetration depth measurements were performed in a 60-T short-pulse
magnet with a 10-ms rise and 40-ms decay time. The rf technique has
proven to be a sensitive and accurate method for determining the H_(c2)
of superconductors.[21] This technique is highly sensitive to small
changes in the rf penetration depth (∼1-5 nm) in the mixed state. As the
magnetic field is applied, the probe detects the transition to the
normal state by tracking the shift in resonant frequency, which is
proportional to the change in penetration depth as Δλ ∝ ΔF/F₀, where F₀
is 25 MHz in the current setup. Because of the eddy current heating
caused by the pulsed field, small single crystals were chosen, where the
sample was placed in a circular detection coil for H ∥ ab and was
located on the top surface of one side of the counterwound coil pair for
H ∥ c.[22, 23] For the H ∥ c configuration, the coupling between sample
and coil is weaker than that for H ∥ ab, resulting in a smaller
frequency shift that is still sufficient to resolve H_(c2)(T). Details
about this technique can be found in Refs. [17, 22] and [23].

Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the normalized
resistivity for the K_(0.83)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ sample. A sharp drop,
corresponding to the superconducting transition, was observed around 32
K. At high temperatures, the resistance increases with decreasing
temperature and exhibits a broad maximum at around 220 K.[16, 24] The
offset and zero-resistance (R < 3 × 10⁻⁵Ω) temperatures were estimated
to be $T_{c}^{\rm offset}\simeq 32.2$ K and
$T_{c}^{\rm offset}\simeq 32$ K, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
The solid lines in Fig. 1(b) are warming curves of the rf shift (ΔF) at
H = 0 for two different samples. As the temperature decreases, the rf
shift suddenly increases at T_(c), where T_(c) = 32 and 32.4 K for two
samples were determined from d ΔF/dT. A clear anisotropy in the response
of the superconductivity under applied fields was observed between
H ∥ ab and H ∥ c as shown in Fig. 1(b) for H = 14 T curves. To compare
the superconducting transition between resistance and the ΔF
measurement, resistance data measured in a superconducting magnet and ΔF
taken in pulsed magnetic fields at T = 31 K for H ∥ ab and at T = 28 K
for H ∥ c are plotted in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. As shown in
the figures, the deviation from the background signal of Δ F is close to
the H_(c)^(offset) criterion of the resistance curves.

Using the deviation from normal-state criterion just discussed, the ΔF
versus H plots shown in Figs. 2 and 3 can be used to infer the
temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_(c2)(T) by taking
the slope of the rf signal intercepting the slope of the normal-state
background or by simply taking the first point deviating from the
normal-state background. Importantly, the difference between these two
related criteria is small and does not affect the H_(c2)(T) curve. In
the high-temperature region, the point at which the ΔF signal deviates
from the background is close to the H_(c)^(offset) of the resistance
data as shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). Therefore, H_(c2) was determined
at the point at which ΔF deviates from the background signal. Arrows in
Figs. 2 and 3 indicate the determined H_(c2). The difference between the
H_(c2) values determined by the first deviation and slope-change point
criteria was used to determine the H_(c2) error bar size.

The H_(c2)(T) curves for both H ∥ ab (H_(c2)^(ab)) and H ∥ c
(H_(c2)^(c)) in K_(0.8)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ are measurements. The curvature of
H_(c2)(T) has been reported to vary depending on the criteria used to
determine H_(c2), for example, in the case of highly two-dimensional,
high-T_(c) cuprate superconductors.[25] In this study, the shape of the
H_(c2) curves does not change qualitatively when H_(c2) is defined by
different criteria or even different measurements. On the other hand,
the shapes of the upper critical field curves for H ∥ ab and H ∥ c
clearly do not manifest the same temperature dependence. As evidenced
from Fig. 4, a conventional linear field dependence of H_(c2) is
observed close to the T_(c), with clearly different slopes for the two
field orientations. In the low-field region the H_(c2) curves are
consistent with earlier studies.[24; 26] Toward higher fields,
H_(c2)^(c)(T) presents an almost linear temperature dependence down to
1.5 K, whereas the curve of H_(c2)^(ab)(T) has a tendency to saturate.
The anisotropy parameter, γ_(H) ≡ H_(c2)^(ab)/H_(c2)^(c), is about ∼2
near T_(c) but shows a maximum around 27 K with γ_(H)∼ 3.6 and decreases
considerably for lower temperatures. In all known examples so far, the
temperature dependence of γ_(H) was opposite to that of
γ_(x) ≡ λ_(c)/λ_(ab). It would be interesting to examine γ_(x)(T) in
this material, in particular, to see if it goes through a minimum at ∼27
K.

The zero temperature limit of H_(c2) can be estimated by using the
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory,[27] which gives
H_(c2) = 0.69T_(c)(dH_(c2)/dT)∣_(T_(c)). The value of H_(c2)(0) for
H ∥ ab and H ∥ c were estimated to be ∼102 and ∼ 31 T, respectively,
where T_(c) = 32 K, dH_(c2)^(ab)/dT ∼ −4.6T/K, and dH_(c2)^(c)/dT ∼ −1.4
T/K were used. Clearly, these values do not capture the salient physics
for this compound. On the other hand, in the simplest approximation, the
Pauli limit (H_(P)) is given by 1.84T_(c),[28; 29; 30] giving H_(P)∼ 59
T. This low-temperature value of H_(c2) may indeed capture some of the
basic physics associated with K_(0.8)Fe_(1.76)Se₂. To explain the
observed H_(c2) curves in detail, a more complete theoretical treatment
is needed, one that does not exclude the strong electron-phonon coupling
and multiband nature of Fe-based compounds. Anisotropic superconducting
coherence length can be calculated using
$H_{c2}^{ab}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{ab}c}$ and
$H_{c2}^{c}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi_{ab}c}$.[31] If H_(c2)^(c) = 60 T
and H_(c2)^(ab) is assumed to be between 60 and 100 T, then ξ_(ab)∼ 2.3
nm and 1.4 nm  ≲ ξ_(c)≲ 2.3 nm.

On the basis of this study for K_(0.8)Fe_(1.76)Se₂, the behavior of
H_(c2)(T) is found to be very similar to that of several 122-type
systems as well as doped FeSe.[17; 18; 19; 20] It should be noted that
the H_(c2) curves for two orientations in the K-doped BaFe₂As₂ system
seem to cross at low temperatures due to the flattening of
H_(c2)^(ab)(T) curve;[17; 19] additionally, the H_(c2) curves for
FeTe_(0.6)Se_(0.4) shows a crossing between H ∥ ab and H ∥ c curves
below 4.5 K because of the subsequent flattening of the H_(c2)^(ab)
curve at low temperatures.[32; 33] However, in the Co-doped system, the
anisotropic H_(c2)(T) curves do not show such crossing,[18; 20] a result
similar to what was found in this study. Thus, an intriguing feature of
H_(c2)(T) curves for Co- and K-doped BaFe₂As₂, FeTe_(0.6)Se_(0.4), and
K_(0.8)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ systems is that the anisotropy near T_(c) is as
large as 3 but drops toward ∼1 as T→ 0 K. The H_(c2)(T) anisotropy in
K_(0.8)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ is particularly noteworthy given that it exists deep
within an antiferromagnetically ordered state.[13; 14; 15] In the case
of Co-doped Ba122, γ_(H)(T)∼ 1 when T_(c) < T_(N) with clear anisotropy
emerging only when the antiferromagnetic state is suppressed.[18] These
results raise the following question: To what extent is the
antiferromagnetism in K_(0.8)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ interacting with
lower-temperature superconductivity? Clearly more work will be needed to
answer this key query.

In summary, the H_(c2)-T phase diagram for the K_(0.8)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ has
been constructed by means of measuring both the electrical resistance in
a dc superconducting magnet (H ≤ 14 T) and the rf contactless
penetration depth in a pulsed magnetic field up to 60 T. The upper
critical field of K_(0.8)Fe_(1.76)Se₂ is determined as H_(c2)^(ab)(18 K)
≃ 54 T and H_(c2)^(c)(1.6 K) ≃ 56 T. The anisotropy parameter γ_(H)
initially increases with decreasing temperature, passes through a
maximum of ∼3.6 near 27 K, and then decreases to ∼2.5 at 18 K. The
observed γ_(H) values show a weakening anisotropic effect at low
temperatures. Although the Fe-based superconductors have a layered
crystal structure, a weak anisotropy of H_(c2) may be a common feature,
suggesting that the interlayer coupling and the three-dimensional Fermi
surface may play an important role in the superconductivity of this
family.
