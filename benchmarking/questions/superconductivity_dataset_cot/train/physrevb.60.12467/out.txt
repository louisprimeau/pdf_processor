###### Abstract

The superconducting resistive transition has been investigated in high-quality Bi2Sr2CuO_x single crystals with critical temperature _T_c (midpoint) = 3.7 - 9 K in magnetic fields (continuous up to 28 T and pulsed up to 52 T) applied perpendicular and parallel to the _ab_ plane. The temperature dependence of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\bullet} determined as the field at which the in-plane resistivity in the transition region is 90% or more of the normal state resistivity is down to temperatures _T_/_T_c = 0.3, in close agreement with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theoretical curve calculated for conventional type-II superconductors. The following thermodynamic parameters were extracted from the experimental results: H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0)_{ab}= 16 - 27 T, H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0)_{c}= 43 T (for 50% of the normal state resistance), corresponding to superconducting coherence lengths \xi_{ab}(0)= 35 - 45 A and \xi_{c}(0)= 15 A . The measured field dependence of the mixed-state Hall effect confirms the temperature dependence of the resistive upper critical field found from the superconducting transitions.

## 1 Introduction

Despite the fact that the upper critical field _H_c2(0) is one of the fundamental parameters in the problem of high-_T_c superconductivity, up to now some ambiguity has existed about the values and the temperature dependence of _H_c2(_T_). Due to the structural simplicity and the low critical temperature _T_c, the low-_T_c phases of the high-_T_c superconductors (HTSC) are an excellent choice for studying the superconducting and normal state transport properties. Recently, by measuring the resistive transitions of low-critical-temperature oxides Tl2Ba2CuO6 (Tl2201), single crystals (_T_c near 20 K),1 and Bi2Sr2CuO6 (Bi2201) films (transition from 19 down to 12 K),2 in high magnetic fields, an anomalous temperature dependence of _H_c2(_T_) was observed. The magnetoresistance (MR) curves were shifted to higher fields with decreasing temperature, but evidence of saturation down to temperatures in the mK range was not found. The value of _H_c2(0) exceeded the one expected from the slope _dH_c2/_dT_ at _T_c greatly. This anomalous exotic behavior cannot be explained by any well-established model.

The conventional superconductors show a steplike resistive transition with only small broadening for reduced _T_c values at increasing field. In this case, _H_c2(_T_) values can be directly obtained from the shifts of the resistive transition curves as a function of the applied field. Due to the significant field-induced broadening of the resistive transition in HTSC such a method can lead to great uncertainty.3 Nevertheless, data for the magnetotransport measurements of La(2-_x_)Sr4CuO4 (Ref. 4) suggest that whereas the superconducting transitions of optimally doped (with the maximum _T_c) and underdoped samples broaden as the magnetic field is applied, the overdoped samples show a parallel shift. This assumption is supported by the fact that the overdoped samples Tl2201 in the above-mentioned article1 have relatively sharp magnetic transitions with parallel shifts to higher fields as the temperature is lowered.

It is well known that the preparation of homogeneous, single-phase, and pure single crystals of the HTSC with satisfactory quality is a very difficult task. A significant spatial variation in the concentration of the mobile oxygen can have dramatic effects on the magnetotransport phenomena and on the width of the superconducting transition in a magnetic field. In contrast to the situation for the Tl2201 compound, in the Bi2201 crystals the oxygen ions have a low mobility and a weak sensitivity of _T_c to oxygen content in the CuO2 planes. In this connection we have studied the temperature dependence of the upper critical field _H_c2(_T_) by using high-quality Bi2201 single crystals. The investigations of the _H_c2(_T_) dependence were performed in magnetic fields up to 52 T.

After a description of the investigated samples and their characteristics, we will discuss the measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting transition in crystals which reveal conditions close to the flux-flow regime. It is known [5] that in the case of a broadened superconducting transition different criteria can lead to different temperature dependencies for H_{e2}^{\#}(T). Therefore, the temperature dependence for the resistive upper critical field H_{e2}^{\#} will be determined from the field at which the resistivity \rho in the transition region is 10%, 50%, or 90% of the saturation value of the normal state resistivity \rho_{n} at a given temperature.

## II Experiment

The Sr-deficient Bi_{\{2+x\}}Sr_{\{2-(x+y)\}}Cu_{\{1+y\}}O_{\{1+y\}}O_{\{2\}} single crystals were grown in a gaseous phase in the large closed cavities of a KCl solution melt. [6] In this case, the crystals do not have contact with the solidified melt in the crucible, thereby avoiding thermal stresses during cooldown. The number of the crystals in one cavity reached several tens. The crystals were grown in the temperature range 830-850 ^{\circ}C with the ratio Bi/Sr = 1.4-1.5 provided the Cu content was increased insignificantly. Due to the long growth time our single crystals have high cation ordering. The sizes of the crystals were around \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad  crystals, the carrier density n = 5.1 x 1021 cm-3 at 10 K and the effective mass in the _ab_ plane _m_* = 3_m__o_. With this value of _m_* we calculated k_{r} = 0.44 A -1, Fermi velocity r_{F} = 1.7x107 cm/s and l = 90-50 A. It seems likely that _m_* extracted from optical data is more suited to the determination of the transport parameters of crystals.

## III Results and discussion

The zero field temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity of our low-_T__c_ Bi2201 single crystals was described in considerable detail earlier.[13] As an example we display in the upper inset of Fig. 1 the typical temperature dependences of the in-plane r_{b} and out-of-plane r_{c} resistivities for two single crystals with T_{c} = 4.6 K (A) and 8.5 K (B) under zero magnetic field. In the study of the superconducting resistive transition of the crystals in magnetic fields we observed that all transition curves in the magnetic field saturated at temperatures down to 0.4 K. In Fig. 1 (main panel) the zero field resistivity is plotted as a function of temperature (open circles) for one of the studied crystals. The stars represent the data points for r_{b}(_T_) measured in a magnetic field H = 20 T. At temperatures T < T_{c} the resistivity data were defined from the resistive transition as a function of magnetic field in the saturated portion of the r_{b}(_H_) curves. The lower inset in Fig. 1 shows an expanded scale of the low-temperature data. The high magnetic-field measurements testify that the _ab_ plane resistivity in the normal state shows the ordinary behavior for a metal down to 0.4 K. Analogous results were obtained on the low-_T__c_ phases of Tl2201,[1] YBa2(Cu0.9yZn0.03)O7-_d_,[5] and very recently on La-doped Bi2201 (T_{c} = 13 K).[14] Since the finding is in close agreement with data published earlier, we will not discuss these results here.

The resistive superconducting transitions have shown a significant field-induced broadening even at low measuring dc currents (30 _m_A). In Fig. 2 we report the magnetoresistance curves for two samples #13 (a) and #24 (b) at various temperatures with the field direction perpendicular to the _ab_ plane of the crystal. The zero-field temperature region of the transition defined by the 10% and 90% points of the transition equals 5.1 - 6.8 K for sample #13 and 8.7 - 9.5 K for sample #24. The dashed lines in Fig. 2(a) show the method used to define H_{c2}^{\circ} from the measured r_{b}(_H_) curve. Three other studied samples #10, #5, and #14 had the transition between 5.8 - 6.5 K, 4.3 - 4.8 K, and 4.5 - 5 K, respectively. The field-induced resistive transitions for all three samples were similar to those shown in Fig. 2. In spite of the strong broadening of the magnetic transitions one can see in Fig. 2 that the resistive transitions in the normal state are completed at 25 T, even at the lowest experimental temperature (a weak increase of the normal-state resistance is due to a MR contribution in high magnetic fields).

We also measured the resistive transitions for one of our Bi2201 crystals (#54, T_{c} = 5.5 K) in a 52-T pulsed magnetic field with a 10-kHz excitation current of 10 _m_A using a lock-in amplifier. Similar results were obtained. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows the magnetic field dependence of the in-plane resistivity for the Bi2201 single crystal at 4.2 K and

We have studied the resistive transitions with the magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane and obtained similar results. Because of the very large values of the upper critical fields in the {\bf H}\|{\bf ab} geometry we defined the H_{c2}^{\bullet} values in this case for 50% and 10% of the normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} only. The transport current was in the _ab_ plane of the crystals and orthogonal to the field in all cases.

It is well known that in layered HTSC the magnetoresistance near T_{c} is strongly influenced by phenomena related to thermal fluctuations and quasi-two-dimensional vortex states.[15, 16] Because of the low pinning energies and large fluctuations in the case of the high-T_{c} phases of HTSC, transport measurements determine an irreversibility line rather than the thermodynamic critical field H_{c2}. However, in spite of the low T_{c} values of our samples and the low measuring temperatures where thermal fluctuations must play an insignificant role, the MR curves are broadened as before. A similar behavior of the magnetic transitions in the {\bf H}\|{\bf c} geometry in Bi2201 at temperatures T\!=\!2.2-5.4 K was briefly reported previously.[10] If we assume that because of the significant excess of Bi our crystals are heavily doped, the data in Fig. 2 are in strong contrast to the data for overdoped Tl2201 single crystals[1] and Bi2201 films.[2] In cited papers,[1, 2] relatively sharp magnetic transitions with parallel shifts to higher fields are observed even at temperatures near T_{c} . However, in present measurements as may be seen from Fig. 2 the transition widths decrease and the curves shift parallel to higher fields at lower temperatures only. Most probably such a sharpening of the superconducting transitions is caused by reduced flux-flow effects at the lowest temperatures. In the optimally La-doped Bi2201 polycrystals samples which have the maximum value T_{c}\!=\!25 K for Bi2201 a carrier density near n\!=\!3\!\times\!10^{21} cm^{-3} was obtained.[7] Then our single crystals with T_{c}\!=\!3.5\!-\!4 K need to be assigned to be heavily doped. On the other hand, as is reported in Ref. [17], the carrier concentration in the underdoped Bi_{2}Sr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{6+\delta} single crystals with T_{c}\!=\!13 K are similar. Because the largest value of T_{c} in our pure Bi2201 single crystals approximately equals 13 K, the samples studied here with T_{c}\!=\!9-10 K are most likely to be near optimal doping. Taking into account the relatively large value of the elastic scattering length, this assumption seems plausible.[18] This is consistent with the observed wide superconducting transition of the La-doped Bi2201 samples in pulsed magnetic fields.[14] La doping reduces the hole concentration[7] and the width of the transition curves increases. Unfortunately, such doping deteriorates the crystal quality also and the superconducting transition width in magnetic fields is as large as 20 T even at T\!=\!0.8 K. The sharpening of the superconducting transitions upon lowering the temperature was recently observed in the underdoped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system.[19]

Another prominent feature of the MR curves for the low-T_{c} samples (Fig. 2) is that all curves in the {\bf H}\|{\bf c} geometry saturate at high enough fields and to the same value. This is consistent with the temperature independence of the normal state resistivity of our samples at low temperatures.[13]

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependencies of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\bullet} in the {\bf H}\|{\bf c} geometry for samples #13 (a) and #24 (b) extracted from the HR curves. The H_{c2}^{\bullet} values are obtained from the fields at which the resistivity of the samples has reached the samples has reached 10%, 50%, 90%, and 100% of its normal-state value \rho_{n}.

This is consistent with the temperature independence of the normal state resistivity of our samples at low temperatures.[13]

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependencies of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\bullet} in the {\bf H}\|{\bf c} geometry for samples #13 (a) and #24 (b) extracted from the resistive transitions of the crystals. The H_{c2}^{\bullet} values are the fields at which the resistivity of the samples has reached 10%, 50%, 90%, and 100% of its normal-state value \rho_{n}.

 as determined from the \rho = \rho_{n} criterion we obtained the slopes dH_{c2}^{*}/dT_{c} ranging from -2.9 T/K to -4.7 T/K for the five samples in the **H\parallele** geometry. For the **H\parallela**b geometry the values dH_{c2}^{*}/dT_{c} = - 12 T/K (sample #7, T_{c} = 3-4.5 K) and -5 T/K (sample #26, T_{c} = 6-7.7 K) for the 50% and 10% criteria, respectively, were obtained. Using a linear extrapolation of dH_{c2}^{*}(T) from T_{c} to zero temperature we found H_{c2}^{*}(0) \approx 27, 22 T, 20 T, 21 T, and 16 T (**H\parallelc** axis) for samples #24, #13, #10, #5 and #14, respectively. In the case of the **H\parallela**b plane geometry H_{c2}^{*}(0) = 40 - 43 T for sample #7 and #26 (50% criterion) was obtained. Using a Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH)-type extrapolation to lower temperature [20] with H_{c2}^{*}(0) = 0.693(-dH_{c2}^{*}/dT)T_{c}^{\prime} we obtained from the \rho = \rho_{n} points H_{c2}^{*}(0) = 22 T, 15 T, 14 T, 14.5 T, and 11 T (samples #24, #13, #10, #5, and #14, respectively) for **H\parallelc** axis. Here, the dH_{c2}^{*}/dT is taken to be the tangent of H_{c2}^{*}(T) at temperatures close to T_{c} and T_{c}^{\prime} the intersection of this tangent with the temperature axis. Our results differ strongly from those found in Ref. 2 for Bi2201 films which have higher values of T_{c} (the midpoint transition at \simeq15 K and the transition width \simeq7 K). Extrapolating the data near T_{c} , the slope dH_{c2}^{*}/dT = - 0.29 T/K and H_{c2}(0) = 3.8 T were found for these films. [2] Since the superconducting transitions of our Bi2201 samples are broadened in a magnetic field and different criteria lead to different temperature dependencies for H_{c2}^{*}(T), we will consider that the data obtained from \rho \simeq \rho_{n} (90% and 100% criteria) show the most accurate reflection of the H_{c2}^{*}(T) dependence. For comparison we determined H_{c2}^{*}(T) also from crossing between the extrapolated normal state resistivity and the tangent of the transition. As a result, smaller values for H_{c2}^{*}(T) and H_{c2}^{*}(0) were obtained but the general view of the H_{c2}^{*}(T) curves remained the same.

Returning to Fig. 3, we observe that the temperature dependence of H_{c2}^{*} obtained from the 10% and 50% criteria demonstrate a strong upward curvature as observed earlier in overdoped materials. [1, 2, 5] In these cited articles [1, 2] the positive curvature of the H_{c2}^{*}(T) dependence was independent of the chosen criterion. It can be supposed that our data deduced from 0.1\rho_{n} and 0.5\rho_{n} criteria determine the irreversibility line which lies well below H_{c2}^{*}(T) and has an upward curvature. [21] The irreversibility line, as is known, does not occupy a well defined position in the H-T diagram insofar as that it depends on the sample, sample size, and other experimental conditions.

For our single crystals with a low T_{c} subsequently involving low measuring temperatures, the fluctuation effects should be quite small except for temperatures very close to T_{c} . However, as can be seen from the broadened transitions close to H_{c2} in Fig. 2, the short coherence length and the large anisotropy probably enhance the contribution of thermal fluctuations. The resistive transition widths decrease with increasing magnetic field for temperatures lower than T \approx 3 K, where the transition curves are shifted showing a clear flux-flow regime with a resistivity linear in field. For the 2D superconductors a crossover between free flux flow and thermally activated motion should take place at a melting temperature T_{m} of the vortex lattice [22] given by T_{m} = (1/8\pi\sqrt{3})\Phi_{0}^{2}/16k_{B}\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}\approx5.5 K using the London penetration depth \lambda_{ab}\approx3100 A (Ref. 23), the CuO_{2} interlayer spacing s = 12.3 A , and the flux quantum \Phi_{0}. The estimated T_{m} value is close to that found in our experiment.

Earlier measurements of the flux-flow resistivity \rho_{f} in conventional type-II superconductors have shown that \rho_{f} is proportional to the magnetic field at low temperatures, i.e., \rho_{f}/\rho_{n} = H/H_{c2}(0) (Ref. 24), where \rho_{n} is the normal-state resistivity. For the comparison of experimental data on different samples it is convenient to use the dimensionless ratio S(T) = \left[{{Hd(\rho_{f}/\rho_{n})}/{dH}}\right]_{H_{c2}}. This parameter extracted from our MR data for the **H\parallelc** geometry as a measure for the slope of the transition curves is plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of the reduced temperature. As is seen from Fig. 4, the range of S(T) values for Bi2201 is almost comparable to that for the conventional dirty Nb-Ta, In-Bi, and Pb-Tl alloys, [25] but their parameters S depend inversely on temperature. In the present case the behavior of S(T) reflects the fact that the depinning field (the onset of resistance) of Bi2201 increases faster than H_{c2}^{*} with decreasing temperature. This is also evident from Fig. 2. Since a depinning line due to thermally activated flux creep is the irreversibility line [26, 27] and the irreversibility field [21] follows an exponential law H_{ir} = \exp(- {T/T_{c}}) or a power law H_{ir} = T^{- 2}, the observed temperature dependence of S seems plausible. The solid curve in Fig. 4 corresponds to the formula A \times \exp(- \alpha T/T_{c}) with A = 2.17 and \alpha = 7.14.

It is known that resistance measurements provide the lower limit for \rho_{f} because pinning may be present. Then using the expression for flux-flow viscosity \eta = \Phi_{0}H/c^{2}\rho_{f} we find the upper limit for \eta \approx 1.8\times 10^{- 7} g/cms at T = 4.3 K and H = 1 T (Fig. 2). This value is close to the theoretical viscosity \eta \approx 3\times 10^{- 7} g/cm s, estimated by use of the formula \eta = \Phi_{0}H_{c2}(0)_{ab}/c^{2}\rho_{n} with the averaged value of the normal-state resistivity in the ab plane \rho_{n} = 120\mu\Omega cm. Based on the data presented in Fig. 4 and the calculated values of T_{m} and \eta, we believe that for the measurements of the MR of our crystals in the mixed state the conditions close to the flux-flow regime were realized. For this reason at the significant broadening of the superconducting transition in a magnetic field, the influence of the flux

  motion dissipation becomes less noticeable when H_{c2}^{\#} is determined at a higher fraction of \rho_{n}. Hence, we suppose that the obtained data for H_{c2}^{\#}(T) in the **H\|c** geometry using the \rho\!=\!0.9\rho_{n} and \rho\!=\!\rho_{n} criteria are rather close to the true values. Then the upper critical field for our Bi2201 single crystals is H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{ab}\!=\!16\!-\!27 T. Because of the very high upper critical fields in the **H\|ab** geometry, we could determine H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{c}\!\simeq\!43 T for the \rho\!=\!0.5\rho_{n} criterion only. If we take H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{ab} at \rho\!=\!0.5\rho_{n} equal to 16 T (Fig. 3), we find that the anisotropy H_{c2}^{\#}(0)\|_{ab}/H_{c2}^{\#}(0)\|_{c} equals 2.7. We may also estimate the ab plane and c axis coherence lengths at zero temperature from the anisotropic Ginsburg-Landau relations [28]H_{c2}^{\#}(0)\|_{c}\!=\!\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2} and H_{c2}^{\#}(0)\|_{ab} = \Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}. Using the data from the \rho\!=\!\rho_{n} criterion we get for four samples \xi_{ab}\!=\!35\!-\!45 A in the ab plane and \xi_{c}\!=\!14 A in the \epsilon direction. The \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} anisotropy value is found to be 2.7. Comparing these values of \xi_{ab} with the averaged mean-free path \bar{l}\!=\!70 A our crystals appear to be neither in the clean limit nor in the dirty limit with \xi_{ab}/\bar{l}\approx\!0.6. The values of H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{ab} and \xi_{ab}(0) are close to the ones obtained earlier for optimally doped Bi2201 single crystal [10]. Using the energy gap value [29]\Delta_{0}\!=\!3.5 meV, we can estimate the Clogston paramagnetic limit H_{p}(0)\!=\!\Delta_{0}/\mu_{B}\sqrt{2}\!\approx\!24 T (\mu_{B} is Bohr magneton). That is close to the measured values of H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{ab} but lower than the measured H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{c}. A similar suppression of the paramagnetic effect was also observed in the conventional layered superconductors NbSe_{2} and TaS_{2}.

In Fig. 5 we display the reduced critical field h_{c2}=H_{c2}^{\#}/(-dH_{c2}^{\#}/dT)_{T_{c}}T_{c} as a function of the reduced temperature T/T_{c} for five investigated samples at field orientation **H\|c** together with the theoretical WHH curve [20] which describes the behavior of the upper critical field in conventional type-II superconductors without spin paramagnetic and spin-orbit effects. Except for the small region at lower temperatures T/T_{c}\!<\!0.3 the experimental data can be described by the conventional WHH theory. We did not observe any unusual behavior of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\#} in any Bi2201 single crystals that were studied. Notice that the agreement between WHH theory and H_{c2}(T) data has previously been observed also by Chen [30] in studies of a single-crystalline Bi2201 sample in magnetic field up to 8 T at temperatures 4.3-7 K.

The result in Fig. 5 clearly shows that the data for the temperature dependence of the reduced critical field h_{c2} can be described by a linear dependence which is very close to the WHH curve. One can suppose that the deviation of the experimental points at T/T_{c}\!<\!0.3 is indicative of a positive curvature down to the lowest temperatures. However, one must note that at these temperatures it is rather impossible to determine the superconducting transition exactly due to the presence of superconducting fluctuations. In addition, at T\llT_{c} the coherence length is very short and inhomogeneities on the scale of \xi(T) can be resolved, leading to deviation from the averaged properties [31]. Coffe, Muttalib, and Levin [32] calculated the temperature dependence of H_{c2} for highly disordered superconductors and predicted that because the magnetic field diminishes the localization effect, the low-temperature values of H_{c2} can show an enhancement over the WHH curve for dirty superconductors. However, this phenomenon plays probably no role here because in this case one would also expect a negative normal-state in-plane MR. At low temperatures we always observed a positive MR.

Hall effect measurements are a useful method in determining the transport behavior in metals and semimetals. Previous experiments on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} revealed a sign-reversal anomaly of the Hall coefficient R_{H} near T_{c}[33]. Kopn, Ivel'ev, and Kalatsky [34] describe the flux-flow Hall conductivity as a sum of the quasiparticle and vortices parts \sigma_{H}\!=\!\sigma_{H}^{n}\!+\!\sigma_{H}^{f}. \sigma_{H}^{f} is only determined by the imaginary part of the relaxation time and has the same sign for any vortex direction [35]. The Hall conductivity is independent of pinning. The change of sign in Hall resistivity \rho_{xy}(H) relates to exceeding a positive \sigma_{H}^{n} relative to a negative \sigma_{H}^{f}. Roughly approximated, the applied field with \rho_{xy}(H)\!=\!0 may be thought of as an approximate estimation of H_{c2}^{\#}/2 at given temperature. We have measured the field dependence of the mixed-state Hall effect on one of our Bi2201 single crystals #24 at different temperatures down to 0.4 K in magnetic fields up to 23 T perpendicular to the ab plane. We find that \rho_{xy}(H) is negative with a broad minimum at low fields and holelike at high fields in the normal state. By plotting the magnetic fields at points where \rho_{xy}(H)\!=\!0 against reduced temperature, we find in the inset of Fig. 5 that H_{c2}^{\#} varies linearly with T. The H_{c2}^{\#}(T) data determined by this means are in close agreement with those extracted from the \rho_{ab} resistivity for the same sample (Fig. 2).

Figure 6 shows the resistive transitions of sample #13 in a magnetic field **H\|c\|J** at different temperatures. The maximum value of the out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} increases with decreasing temperature in the magnetic field just as in studies of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}[36, 37]. This reflects the common "semi-conducting" normal-state behavior of \rho_{c} in the layered Bi family. The question of the coexistence of the metallic in

  plane resistivity with the "semiconducting"' out-of-plane resistivity down to low temperatures has attracted much attention in last few years and several models have been proposed to explain it. Here, we do not want discuss this topic. However, we would like to notice that the out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} at T\llT_{c} shows a tendency to saturation in very high magnetic fields for the samples with T_{c}\ll5 K. We observed this saturation of the out-of-plane MR in pulsed magnetic fields with the **H\|\mathbf{c}\|J** geometry at 40-50 T. The inset in Fig. 6 shows the magnetic field dependence of \rho_{c} for crystal _t_/54 at T = 4.2 K and 1.9 K. The lock-in-amplifier operates at 10 kHz with an excitation current 500 \mu A. Unfortunately, precise measurements of \rho_{c} are a difficult task in the pulsed magnet, due to the very low resistance of our crystals along the \epsilon axis yielding a higher noise level.

Considering that Bi2201 belongs to the family of the highly anisotropic layered superconductors BiSrCaCuO, it could be expected that the out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} cannot provide information on H_{c2}^{\pm} because in this case the behavior of \rho_{c} is related to Josephson effects and not with the formation of a superconducting order parameter inside the CuO_{2} layers. The resistivity anisotropy \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\sim10^{3}-10^{4} shows that Bi2201 is a highly anisotropic superconductor. However, in contrast to an anisotropy parameter \gamma=\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} = 200-1000 for Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8},[22] for Bi2201 the value of \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}=2.7 was obtained, which could lead to the opposite of the above given conclusion. Indeed, the H_{c2}^{\pm}(T) dependence determined by the maximum in the \rho_{c}(H) curves exhibits a significant positive curvature. The H_{c}^{\pm}(T) data lie close to the points in Fig. 3(a) obtained for the same sample using the 50% criteria. This is consistent with the experimental data because the maxima of \rho_{c}(H) coincide with the field positions of \rho_{ab}(H) = 0.4\rho_{n}. Hence, the peak effect in \rho_{c}(H) is a property of the mixed state and results from a competition between the "'semiconducting" behavior of \rho_{c} and the superconducting transition.

All \rho_{c}(H) curves (Fig. 6) have a pronounced break point in the derivative well above the \rho_{c}(H) peak, which shifts to higher fields with decreasing temperature. At T=T_{c}, this break point disappears. The field position of these break points in the derivative coincide with the H_{c2}^{\pm} values determined by the \rho_{ab}=\rho_{n} criterion with a similar temperature dependence. Since the mechanism of a negative out-of-plane longitudinal magnetoresistance is still unclear, we can only give a qualitative discussion of this phenomenon.

In conclusion, we have studied the superconducting resistive transition in several high-quality Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{x} single crystals with critical temperature T_{c} (midpoint) = 3.7-9 K in magnetic fields up to 28 T for continuous fields and up to 52 T for pulsed fields, both perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane. We found that the temperature dependence of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\pm}, determined as the field at which the in-plane resistivity in the transition region is 90% or more of the normal-state resistivity, is down to the temperatures T/T_{c} = 0.3, in close agreement with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory for conventional type-II superconductors. The measured field dependence of the mixed-state Hall effect at different temperatures down to 0.4 K in the magnetic field up to 28 T confirms the temperature dependence of the resistive upper critical field extracted from the superconducting transitions.

###### Abstract

The superconducting resistive transition has been investigated in high-quality Bi2Sr2CuO_x single crystals with critical temperature _T_c (midpoint) = 3.7 - 9 K in magnetic fields (continuous up to 28 T and pulsed up to 52 T) applied perpendicular and parallel to the _ab_ plane. The temperature dependence of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\bullet} determined as the field at which the in-plane resistivity in the transition region is 90% or more of the normal state resistivity is down to temperatures _T_/_T_c = 0.3, in close agreement with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theoretical curve calculated for conventional type-II superconductors. The following thermodynamic parameters were extracted from the experimental results: H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0)_{ab}= 16 - 27 T, H_{c2}^{\bullet}(0)_{c}= 43 T (for 50% of the normal state resistance), corresponding to superconducting coherence lengths \xi_{ab}(0)= 35 - 45 A and \xi_{c}(0)= 15 A . The measured field dependence of the mixed-state Hall effect confirms the temperature dependence of the resistive upper critical field found from the superconducting transitions.

## 1 Introduction

Despite the fact that the upper critical field _H_c2(0) is one of the fundamental parameters in the problem of high-_T_c superconductivity, up to now some ambiguity has existed about the values and the temperature dependence of _H_c2(_T_). Due to the structural simplicity and the low critical temperature _T_c, the low-_T_c phases of the high-_T_c superconductors (HTSC) are an excellent choice for studying the superconducting and normal state transport properties. Recently, by measuring the resistive transitions of low-critical-temperature oxides Tl2Ba2CuO6 (Tl2201), single crystals (_T_c near 20 K),1 and Bi2Sr2CuO6 (Bi2201) films (transition from 19 down to 12 K),2 in high magnetic fields, an anomalous temperature dependence of _H_c2(_T_) was observed. The magnetoresistance (MR) curves were shifted to higher fields with decreasing temperature, but evidence of saturation down to temperatures in the mK range was not found. The value of _H_c2(0) exceeded the one expected from the slope _dH_c2/_dT_ at _T_c greatly. This anomalous exotic behavior cannot be explained by any well-established model.

The conventional superconductors show a steplike resistive transition with only small broadening for reduced _T_c values at increasing field. In this case, _H_c2(_T_) values can be directly obtained from the shifts of the resistive transition curves as a function of the applied field. Due to the significant field-induced broadening of the resistive transition in HTSC such a method can lead to great uncertainty.3 Nevertheless, data for the magnetotransport measurements of La(2-_x_)Sr4CuO4 (Ref. 4) suggest that whereas the superconducting transitions of optimally doped (with the maximum _T_c) and underdoped samples broaden as the magnetic field is applied, the overdoped samples show a parallel shift. This assumption is supported by the fact that the overdoped samples Tl2201 in the above-mentioned article1 have relatively sharp magnetic transitions with parallel shifts to higher fields as the temperature is lowered.

It is well known that the preparation of homogeneous, single-phase, and pure single crystals of the HTSC with satisfactory quality is a very difficult task. A significant spatial variation in the concentration of the mobile oxygen can have dramatic effects on the magnetotransport phenomena and on the width of the superconducting transition in a magnetic field. In contrast to the situation for the Tl2201 compound, in the Bi2201 crystals the oxygen ions have a low mobility and a weak sensitivity of _T_c to oxygen content in the CuO2 planes. In this connection we have studied the temperature dependence of the upper critical field _H_c2(_T_) by using high-quality Bi2201 single crystals. The investigations of the _H_c2(_T_) dependence were performed in magnetic fields up to 52 T.

After a description of the investigated samples and their characteristics, we will discuss the measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting transition in crystals which reveal conditions close to the flux-flow regime. It is known [5] that in the case of a broadened superconducting transition different criteria can lead to different temperature dependencies for H_{e2}^{\#}(T). Therefore, the temperature dependence for the resistive upper critical field H_{e2}^{\#} will be determined from the field at which the resistivity \rho in the transition region is 10%, 50%, or 90% of the saturation value of the normal state resistivity \rho_{n} at a given temperature.

## II Experiment

The Sr-deficient Bi_{\{2+x\}}Sr_{\{2-(x+y)\}}Cu_{\{1+y\}}O_{\{1+y\}}O_{\{2\}} single crystals were grown in a gaseous phase in the large closed cavities of a KCl solution melt. [6] In this case, the crystals do not have contact with the solidified melt in the crucible, thereby avoiding thermal stresses during cooldown. The number of the crystals in one cavity reached several tens. The crystals were grown in the temperature range 830-850 ^{\circ}C with the ratio Bi/Sr = 1.4-1.5 provided the Cu content was increased insignificantly. Due to the long growth time our single crystals have high cation ordering. The sizes of the crystals were around \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad  crystals, the carrier density n = 5.1 x 1021 cm-3 at 10 K and the effective mass in the _ab_ plane _m_* = 3_m__o_. With this value of _m_* we calculated k_{r} = 0.44 A -1, Fermi velocity r_{F} = 1.7x107 cm/s and l = 90-50 A. It seems likely that _m_* extracted from optical data is more suited to the determination of the transport parameters of crystals.

## III Results and discussion

The zero field temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity of our low-_T__c_ Bi2201 single crystals was described in considerable detail earlier.[13] As an example we display in the upper inset of Fig. 1 the typical temperature dependences of the in-plane r_{b} and out-of-plane r_{c} resistivities for two single crystals with T_{c} = 4.6 K (A) and 8.5 K (B) under zero magnetic field. In the study of the superconducting resistive transition of the crystals in magnetic fields we observed that all transition curves in the magnetic field saturated at temperatures down to 0.4 K. In Fig. 1 (main panel) the zero field resistivity is plotted as a function of temperature (open circles) for one of the studied crystals. The stars represent the data points for r_{b}(_T_) measured in a magnetic field H = 20 T. At temperatures T < T_{c} the resistivity data were defined from the resistive transition as a function of magnetic field in the saturated portion of the r_{b}(_H_) curves. The lower inset in Fig. 1 shows an expanded scale of the low-temperature data. The high magnetic-field measurements testify that the _ab_ plane resistivity in the normal state shows the ordinary behavior for a metal down to 0.4 K. Analogous results were obtained on the low-_T__c_ phases of Tl2201,[1] YBa2(Cu0.9yZn0.03)O7-_d_,[5] and very recently on La-doped Bi2201 (T_{c} = 13 K).[14] Since the finding is in close agreement with data published earlier, we will not discuss these results here.

The resistive superconducting transitions have shown a significant field-induced broadening even at low measuring dc currents (30 _m_A). In Fig. 2 we report the magnetoresistance curves for two samples #13 (a) and #24 (b) at various temperatures with the field direction perpendicular to the _ab_ plane of the crystal. The zero-field temperature region of the transition defined by the 10% and 90% points of the transition equals 5.1 - 6.8 K for sample #13 and 8.7 - 9.5 K for sample #24. The dashed lines in Fig. 2(a) show the method used to define H_{c2}^{\circ} from the measured r_{b}(_H_) curve. Three other studied samples #10, #5, and #14 had the transition between 5.8 - 6.5 K, 4.3 - 4.8 K, and 4.5 - 5 K, respectively. The field-induced resistive transitions for all three samples were similar to those shown in Fig. 2. In spite of the strong broadening of the magnetic transitions one can see in Fig. 2 that the resistive transitions in the normal state are completed at 25 T, even at the lowest experimental temperature (a weak increase of the normal-state resistance is due to a MR contribution in high magnetic fields).

We also measured the resistive transitions for one of our Bi2201 crystals (#54, T_{c} = 5.5 K) in a 52-T pulsed magnetic field with a 10-kHz excitation current of 10 _m_A using a lock-in amplifier. Similar results were obtained. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows the magnetic field dependence of the in-plane resistivity for the Bi2201 single crystal at 4.2 K and

### K. The magnetic field is applied parallel to the **c** axis.

We have studied the resistive transitions with the magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane and obtained similar results. Because of the very large values of the upper critical fields in the {\bf H}\|{\bf ab} geometry we defined the H_{c2}^{\bullet} values in this case for 50% and 10% of the normal-state resistivity \rho_{n} only. The transport current was in the _ab_ plane of the crystals and orthogonal to the field in all cases.

It is well known that in layered HTSC the magnetoresistance near T_{c} is strongly influenced by phenomena related to thermal fluctuations and quasi-two-dimensional vortex states.[15, 16] Because of the low pinning energies and large fluctuations in the case of the high-T_{c} phases of HTSC, transport measurements determine an irreversibility line rather than the thermodynamic critical field H_{c2}. However, in spite of the low T_{c} values of our samples and the low measuring temperatures where thermal fluctuations must play an insignificant role, the MR curves are broadened as before. A similar behavior of the magnetic transitions in the {\bf H}\|{\bf c} geometry in Bi2201 at temperatures T\!=\!2.2-5.4 K was briefly reported previously.[10] If we assume that because of the significant excess of Bi our crystals are heavily doped, the data in Fig. 2 are in strong contrast to the data for overdoped Tl2201 single crystals[1] and Bi2201 films.[2] In cited papers,[1, 2] relatively sharp magnetic transitions with parallel shifts to higher fields are observed even at temperatures near T_{c} . However, in present measurements as may be seen from Fig. 2 the transition widths decrease and the curves shift parallel to higher fields at lower temperatures only. Most probably such a sharpening of the superconducting transitions is caused by reduced flux-flow effects at the lowest temperatures. In the optimally La-doped Bi2201 polycrystals samples which have the maximum value T_{c}\!=\!25 K for Bi2201 a carrier density near n\!=\!3\!\times\!10^{21} cm^{-3} was obtained.[7] Then our single crystals with T_{c}\!=\!3.5\!-\!4 K need to be assigned to be heavily doped. On the other hand, as is reported in Ref. [17], the carrier concentration in the underdoped Bi_{2}Sr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{6+\delta} single crystals with T_{c}\!=\!13 K are similar. Because the largest value of T_{c} in our pure Bi2201 single crystals approximately equals 13 K, the samples studied here with T_{c}\!=\!9-10 K are most likely to be near optimal doping. Taking into account the relatively large value of the elastic scattering length, this assumption seems plausible.[18] This is consistent with the observed wide superconducting transition of the La-doped Bi2201 samples in pulsed magnetic fields.[14] La doping reduces the hole concentration[7] and the width of the transition curves increases. Unfortunately, such doping deteriorates the crystal quality also and the superconducting transition width in magnetic fields is as large as 20 T even at T\!=\!0.8 K. The sharpening of the superconducting transitions upon lowering the temperature was recently observed in the underdoped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system.[19]

Another prominent feature of the MR curves for the low-T_{c} samples (Fig. 2) is that all curves in the {\bf H}\|{\bf c} geometry saturate at high enough fields and to the same value. This is consistent with the temperature independence of the normal state resistivity of our samples at low temperatures.[13]

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependencies of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\bullet} in the {\bf H}\|{\bf c} geometry for samples #13 (a) and #24 (b) extracted from the HR curves. The H_{c2}^{\bullet} values are obtained from the fields at which the resistivity of the samples has reached the samples has reached 10%, 50%, 90%, and 100% of its normal-state value \rho_{n}.

In cited papers,[1, 2] relatively sharp magnetic transitions with parallel shifts to higher fields are observed even at temperatures near T_{c}. However, in present measurements as may be seen from Fig. 2 the transition widths decrease and the curves shift parallel to higher fields at lower temperatures only.

The H_{c2}^{\bullet} values are the fields at which the resistivity of the samples has reached 10%, 50%, 90%, and 100% of its normal-state value \rho_{n}.

The H_{c2}^{\bullet} values are the fields at which the resistivity of the samples has reached 10%, 50%, 90%, and 100% of its normal-state value \rho_{n}.

 as determined from the \rho = \rho_{n} criterion we obtained the slopes dH_{c2}^{*}/dT_{c} ranging from -2.9 T/K to -4.7 T/K for the five samples in the **H\parallele** geometry. For the **H\parallela**b geometry the values dH_{c2}^{*}/dT_{c} = - 12 T/K (sample #7, T_{c} = 3-4.5 K) and -5 T/K (sample #26, T_{c} = 6-7.7 K) for the 50% and 10% criteria, respectively, were obtained. Using a linear extrapolation of dH_{c2}^{*}(T) from T_{c} to zero temperature we found H_{c2}^{*}(0) \approx 27, 22 T, 20 T, 21 T, and 16 T (**H\parallelc** axis) for samples #24, #13, #10, #5 and #14, respectively. In the case of the **H\parallela**b plane geometry H_{c2}^{*}(0) = 40 - 43 T for sample #7 and #26 (50% criterion) was obtained. Using a Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH)-type extrapolation to lower temperature [20] with H_{c2}^{*}(0) = 0.693(-dH_{c2}^{*}/dT)T_{c}^{\prime} we obtained from the \rho = \rho_{n} points H_{c2}^{*}(0) = 22 T, 15 T, 14 T, 14.5 T, and 11 T (samples #24, #13, #10, #5, and #14, respectively) for **H\parallelc** axis. Here, the dH_{c2}^{*}/dT is taken to be the tangent of H_{c2}^{*}(T) at temperatures close to T_{c} and T_{c}^{\prime} the intersection of this tangent with the temperature axis. Our results differ strongly from those found in Ref. 2 for Bi2201 films which have higher values of T_{c} (the midpoint transition at \simeq15 K and the transition width \simeq7 K). Extrapolating the data near T_{c} , the slope dH_{c2}^{*}/dT = - 0.29 T/K and H_{c2}(0) = 3.8 T were found for these films. [2] Since the superconducting transitions of our Bi2201 samples are broadened in a magnetic field and different criteria lead to different temperature dependencies for H_{c2}^{*}(T), we will consider that the data obtained from \rho \simeq \rho_{n} (90% and 100% criteria) show the most accurate reflection of the H_{c2}^{*}(T) dependence. For comparison we determined H_{c2}^{*}(T) also from crossing between the extrapolated normal state resistivity and the tangent of the transition. As a result, smaller values for H_{c2}^{*}(T) and H_{c2}^{*}(0) were obtained but the general view of the H_{c2}^{*}(T) curves remained the same.

Returning to Fig. 3, we observe that the temperature dependence of H_{c2}^{*} obtained from the 10% and 50% criteria demonstrate a strong upward curvature as observed earlier in overdoped materials. [1, 2, 5] In these cited articles [1, 2] the positive curvature of the H_{c2}^{*}(T) dependence was independent of the chosen criterion. It can be supposed that our data deduced from 0.1\rho_{n} and 0.5\rho_{n} criteria determine the irreversibility line which lies well below H_{c2}^{*}(T) and has an upward curvature. [21] The irreversibility line, as is known, does not occupy a well defined position in the H-T diagram insofar as that it depends on the sample, sample size, and other experimental conditions.

For our single crystals with a low T_{c} subsequently involving low measuring temperatures, the fluctuation effects should be quite small except for temperatures very close to T_{c} . However, as can be seen from the broadened transitions close to H_{c2} in Fig. 2, the short coherence length and the large anisotropy probably enhance the contribution of thermal fluctuations. The resistive transition widths decrease with increasing magnetic field for temperatures lower than T \approx 3 K, where the transition curves are shifted showing a clear flux-flow regime with a resistivity linear in field. For the 2D superconductors a crossover between free flux flow and thermally activated motion should take place at a melting temperature T_{m} of the vortex lattice [22] given by T_{m} = (1/8\pi\sqrt{3})\Phi_{0}^{2}/16k_{B}\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}\approx5.5 K using the London penetration depth \lambda_{ab}\approx3100 A (Ref. 23), the CuO_{2} interlayer spacing s = 12.3 A , and the flux quantum \Phi_{0}. The estimated T_{m} value is close to that found in our experiment.

Earlier measurements of the flux-flow resistivity \rho_{f} in conventional type-II superconductors have shown that \rho_{f} is proportional to the magnetic field at low temperatures, i.e., \rho_{f}/\rho_{n} = H/H_{c2}(0) (Ref. 24), where \rho_{n} is the normal-state resistivity. For the comparison of experimental data on different samples it is convenient to use the dimensionless ratio S(T) = \left[{{Hd(\rho_{f}/\rho_{n})}/{dH}}\right]_{H_{c2}}. This parameter extracted from our MR data for the **H\parallelc** geometry as a measure for the slope of the transition curves is plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of the reduced temperature. As is seen from Fig. 4, the range of S(T) values for Bi2201 is almost comparable to that for the conventional dirty Nb-Ta, In-Bi, and Pb-Tl alloys, [25] but their parameters S depend inversely on temperature. In the present case the behavior of S(T) reflects the fact that the depinning field (the onset of resistance) of Bi2201 increases faster than H_{c2}^{*} with decreasing temperature. This is also evident from Fig. 2. Since a depinning line due to thermally activated flux creep is the irreversibility line [26, 27] and the irreversibility field [21] follows an exponential law H_{ir} = \exp(- {T/T_{c}}) or a power law H_{ir} = T^{- 2}, the observed temperature dependence of S seems plausible. The solid curve in Fig. 4 corresponds to the formula A \times \exp(- \alpha T/T_{c}) with A = 2.17 and \alpha = 7.14.

It is known that resistance measurements provide the lower limit for \rho_{f} because pinning may be present. Then using the expression for flux-flow viscosity \eta = \Phi_{0}H/c^{2}\rho_{f} we find the upper limit for \eta \approx 1.8\times 10^{- 7} g/cms at T = 4.3 K and H = 1 T (Fig. 2). This value is close to the theoretical viscosity \eta \approx 3\times 10^{- 7} g/cm s, estimated by use of the formula \eta = \Phi_{0}H_{c2}(0)_{ab}/c^{2}\rho_{n} with the averaged value of the normal-state resistivity in the ab plane \rho_{n} = 120\mu\Omega cm. Based on the data presented in Fig. 4 and the calculated values of T_{m} and \eta, we believe that for the measurements of the MR of our crystals in the mixed state the conditions close to the flux-flow regime were realized. For this reason at the significant broadening of the superconducting transition in a magnetic field, the influence of the flux

  motion dissipation becomes less noticeable when H_{c2}^{\#} is determined at a higher fraction of \rho_{n}. Hence, we suppose that the obtained data for H_{c2}^{\#}(T) in the **H\|c** geometry using the \rho\!=\!0.9\rho_{n} and \rho\!=\!\rho_{n} criteria are rather close to the true values. Then the upper critical field for our Bi2201 single crystals is H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{ab}\!=\!16\!-\!27 T. Because of the very high upper critical fields in the **H\|ab** geometry, we could determine H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{c}\!\simeq\!43 T for the \rho\!=\!0.5\rho_{n} criterion only. If we take H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{ab} at \rho\!=\!0.5\rho_{n} equal to 16 T (Fig. 3), we find that the anisotropy H_{c2}^{\#}(0)\|_{ab}/H_{c2}^{\#}(0)\|_{c} equals 2.7. We may also estimate the ab plane and c axis coherence lengths at zero temperature from the anisotropic Ginsburg-Landau relations [28]H_{c2}^{\#}(0)\|_{c}\!=\!\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2} and H_{c2}^{\#}(0)\|_{ab} = \Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}. Using the data from the \rho\!=\!\rho_{n} criterion we get for four samples \xi_{ab}\!=\!35\!-\!45 A in the ab plane and \xi_{c}\!=\!14 A in the \epsilon direction. The \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} anisotropy value is found to be 2.7. Comparing these values of \xi_{ab} with the averaged mean-free path \bar{l}\!=\!70 A our crystals appear to be neither in the clean limit nor in the dirty limit with \xi_{ab}/\bar{l}\approx\!0.6. The values of H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{ab} and \xi_{ab}(0) are close to the ones obtained earlier for optimally doped Bi2201 single crystal [10]. Using the energy gap value [29]\Delta_{0}\!=\!3.5 meV, we can estimate the Clogston paramagnetic limit H_{p}(0)\!=\!\Delta_{0}/\mu_{B}\sqrt{2}\!\approx\!24 T (\mu_{B} is Bohr magneton). That is close to the measured values of H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{ab} but lower than the measured H_{c2}^{\#}(0)_{c}. A similar suppression of the paramagnetic effect was also observed in the conventional layered superconductors NbSe_{2} and TaS_{2}.

In Fig. 5 we display the reduced critical field h_{c2}=H_{c2}^{\#}/(-dH_{c2}^{\#}/dT)_{T_{c}}T_{c} as a function of the reduced temperature T/T_{c} for five investigated samples at field orientation **H\|c** together with the theoretical WHH curve [20] which describes the behavior of the upper critical field in conventional type-II superconductors without spin paramagnetic and spin-orbit effects. Except for the small region at lower temperatures T/T_{c}\!<\!0.3 the experimental data can be described by the conventional WHH theory. We did not observe any unusual behavior of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\#} in any Bi2201 single crystals that were studied. Notice that the agreement between WHH theory and H_{c2}(T) data has previously been observed also by Chen [30] in studies of a single-crystalline Bi2201 sample in magnetic field up to 8 T at temperatures 4.3-7 K.

The result in Fig. 5 clearly shows that the data for the temperature dependence of the reduced critical field h_{c2} can be described by a linear dependence which is very close to the WHH curve. One can suppose that the deviation of the experimental points at T/T_{c}\!<\!0.3 is indicative of a positive curvature down to the lowest temperatures. However, one must note that at these temperatures it is rather impossible to determine the superconducting transition exactly due to the presence of superconducting fluctuations. In addition, at T\llT_{c} the coherence length is very short and inhomogeneities on the scale of \xi(T) can be resolved, leading to deviation from the averaged properties [31]. Coffe, Muttalib, and Levin [32] calculated the temperature dependence of H_{c2} for highly disordered superconductors and predicted that because the magnetic field diminishes the localization effect, the low-temperature values of H_{c2} can show an enhancement over the WHH curve for dirty superconductors. However, this phenomenon plays probably no role here because in this case one would also expect a negative normal-state in-plane MR. At low temperatures we always observed a positive MR.

Hall effect measurements are a useful method in determining the transport behavior in metals and semimetals. Previous experiments on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} revealed a sign-reversal anomaly of the Hall coefficient R_{H} near T_{c}[33]. Kopn, Ivel'ev, and Kalatsky [34] describe the flux-flow Hall conductivity as a sum of the quasiparticle and vortices parts \sigma_{H}\!=\!\sigma_{H}^{n}\!+\!\sigma_{H}^{f}. \sigma_{H}^{f} is only determined by the imaginary part of the relaxation time and has the same sign for any vortex direction [35]. The Hall conductivity is independent of pinning. The change of sign in Hall resistivity \rho_{xy}(H) relates to exceeding a positive \sigma_{H}^{n} relative to a negative \sigma_{H}^{f}. Roughly approximated, the applied field with \rho_{xy}(H)\!=\!0 may be thought of as an approximate estimation of H_{c2}^{\#}/2 at given temperature. We have measured the field dependence of the mixed-state Hall effect on one of our Bi2201 single crystals #24 at different temperatures down to 0.4 K in magnetic fields up to 23 T perpendicular to the ab plane. We find that \rho_{xy}(H) is negative with a broad minimum at low fields and holelike at high fields in the normal state. By plotting the magnetic fields at points where \rho_{xy}(H)\!=\!0 against reduced temperature, we find in the inset of Fig. 5 that H_{c2}^{\#} varies linearly with T. The H_{c2}^{\#}(T) data determined by this means are in close agreement with those extracted from the \rho_{ab} resistivity for the same sample (Fig. 2).

Figure 6 shows the resistive transitions of sample #13 in a magnetic field **H\|c\|J** at different temperatures. The maximum value of the out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} increases with decreasing temperature in the magnetic field just as in studies of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}[36, 37]. This reflects the common "semi-conducting" normal-state behavior of \rho_{c} in the layered Bi family. The question of the coexistence of the metallic in

The inset shows the temperature dependence of H_{c2}^{\#} at points where the Hall resistivity \rho_{xy}(H)\!=\!0.

  plane resistivity with the "semiconducting"' out-of-plane resistivity down to low temperatures has attracted much attention in last few years and several models have been proposed to explain it. Here, we do not want discuss this topic. However, we would like to notice that the out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} at T\llT_{c} shows a tendency to saturation in very high magnetic fields for the samples with T_{c}\ll5 K. We observed this saturation of the out-of-plane MR in pulsed magnetic fields with the **H\|\mathbf{c}\|J** geometry at 40-50 T. The inset in Fig. 6 shows the magnetic field dependence of \rho_{c} for crystal _t_/54 at T = 4.2 K and 1.9 K. The lock-in-amplifier operates at 10 kHz with an excitation current 500 \mu A. Unfortunately, precise measurements of \rho_{c} are a difficult task in the pulsed magnet, due to the very low resistance of our crystals along the \epsilon axis yielding a higher noise level.

Considering that Bi2201 belongs to the family of the highly anisotropic layered superconductors BiSrCaCuO, it could be expected that the out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} cannot provide information on H_{c2}^{\pm} because in this case the behavior of \rho_{c} is related to Josephson effects and not with the formation of a superconducting order parameter inside the CuO_{2} layers. The resistivity anisotropy \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\sim10^{3}-10^{4} shows that Bi2201 is a highly anisotropic superconductor. However, in contrast to an anisotropy parameter \gamma=\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} = 200-1000 for Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8},[22] for Bi2201 the value of \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}=2.7 was obtained, which could lead to the opposite of the above given conclusion. Indeed, the H_{c2}^{\pm}(T) dependence determined by the maximum in the \rho_{c}(H) curves exhibits a significant positive curvature. The H_{c}^{\pm}(T) data lie close to the points in Fig. 3(a) obtained for the same sample using the 50% criteria. This is consistent with the experimental data because the maxima of \rho_{c}(H) coincide with the field positions of \rho_{ab}(H) = 0.4\rho_{n}. Hence, the peak effect in \rho_{c}(H) is a property of the mixed state and results from a competition between the "'semiconducting" behavior of \rho_{c} and the superconducting transition.

All \rho_{c}(H) curves (Fig. 6) have a pronounced break point in the derivative well above the \rho_{c}(H) peak, which shifts to higher fields with decreasing temperature. At T=T_{c}, this break point disappears. The field position of these break points in the derivative coincide with the H_{c2}^{\pm} values determined by the \rho_{ab}=\rho_{n} criterion with a similar temperature dependence. Since the mechanism of a negative out-of-plane longitudinal magnetoresistance is still unclear, we can only give a qualitative discussion of this phenomenon.

In conclusion, we have studied the superconducting resistive transition in several high-quality Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{x} single crystals with critical temperature T_{c} (midpoint) = 3.7-9 K in magnetic fields up to 28 T for continuous fields and up to 52 T for pulsed fields, both perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane. We found that the temperature dependence of the resistive upper critical field H_{c2}^{\pm}, determined as the field at which the in-plane resistivity in the transition region is 90% or more of the normal-state resistivity, is down to the temperatures T/T_{c} = 0.3, in close agreement with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory for conventional type-II superconductors. The measured field dependence of the mixed-state Hall effect at different temperatures down to 0.4 K in the magnetic field up to 28 T confirms the temperature dependence of the resistive upper critical field extracted from the superconducting transitions.
