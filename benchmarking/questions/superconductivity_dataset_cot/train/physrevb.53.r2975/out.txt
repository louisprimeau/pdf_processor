###### Abstract

The phase diagram of (Nd1-_x_Tb)1.85Ce0.15CuO4 has been studied by resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, x-ray, electron-, and neutron-diffraction experiments. For low-Tb concentrations the samples are superconducting; however, _Tc_ diminishes rapidly with increasing x. For higher Tb concentrations all diffraction studies indicate the long-range lattice deformation characterized by the rotation of the CuO4 squares around the c axis (i.e., the orthorhombic phase recently observed in Gd2CuO4); the structural consequences of the distortion are discussed.

Recently a structural distortion of the _T'_ phase was observed in Gd2CuO4,1 where the CuO4 squares are rotated around the c axis by an angle of 5.2deg at room temperature. The underlying structural phase transition appears to be dominated by the ionic radius of the R since Nd0.38Tb1.62CuO4, which possesses the same averaged ionic radius as Gd2CuO4, presents the identical distortion.1

 both temperatures a linear dependence is observed for the a parameter, the c parameter plot represents clear kinks indicating a modified crystal structure for Tb concentrations higher than x_{c}(295 K)=0.46(2) and x_{c}(11 K)=0.36(3). A similar kink seen in the dependence of the published R_{2}CuO_{4}c parameters on the R ionic radius [7, 8] indicates a general strain order-parameter coupling. For high-Tb concentrations we additionally observe superstructure peaks which can be indexed in a \sqrt{2}a\times\sqrt{2}a\times c lattice in respect to the high-temperature _14/mmm_ structure; for example the (212) reflection is shown in Fig. 3. Rietveld refinements with the patterns obtained with \lambda=2.43 and 1.22 A confirm that the superstructure in the NTCCO samples is identical to the one observed in Gd_{2}CuO_{4} (Ref. [1]) with space group Acam (standard setting Cmca), i.e., the superstructure is characterized by the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares. (In the following this transition will be called rotation transition in contrast to the tilt transitions in the T phase where the axes of rotation lie within the CuO_{2} plane.) As discussed in Ref. [1], the simplest structural distortion due to a CuO_{4} rotation corresponds to the space group Acam. More complex structures correspond to different stacking sequences of the distorted CuO_{2} planes leading to at least a doubling of the c parameter, a situation not supported by the diffraction pattern. The space group I4_{1}/acd which is reported for the similarly distorted Sr_{2}IrO_{4} and Sr_{2}RhO_{4} structures [9], is incompatible with the positions of the superstructure reflections.

The main characteristic of the transition is the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares around c (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 1 in Ref. [1]), which is the order parameter. The T=11 K values scale roughly linearly with (x-x_{c}). Attempts to refine a distortion of the rotated CuO_{4} square gave no improvement compared to the rigid one; therefore, the plane oxygen [O(1)] position was constrained to (0.25+d,0.25-d,0). The upper limit for the splitting of the CuO bond distances can be estimated to 0.01 A. A smaller splitting, even though too small to be detected by powder diffraction, might have a strong impact on the electronic band structure.

As a consequence of the rotation transition at higher Tb contents several bond lengths are strongly modified. The Cu-O(1) distance decreases with increasing Tb content as long as the samples stay in the ideal T^{\prime} structure in accordance with the relatively smaller ionic radius of the Tb ion. For higher Tb contents the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares gives rise to an elongation of the Cu-O(1) bond when compared to the value extrapolated from the I4/mmm plane. In this system with a Ce concentration of 0.15 the Cu-O(1) bond does not go below 1.958 A. The elongation of the Cu-O(1) bond in the distorted phase was also observed for the tilt transition in the T phase [10]. So, a similar bond-length mismatch between the R-O and Cu-O subsystems might be responsible for the rotation transition in the T^{\prime} phase in agreement with the pronounced dependency on the R ionic radius [1, 11]. However, a more detailed analysis with respect to the rather an

  isotropic coordinations reveals a more complex driving mechanism.[12]

The influence of Ce doping on the transition has been studied by comparing the superstructure reflection intensities in (Nd_{0.35}Tb_{0.65})_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} and (Nd_{0.35}Tb_{0.65})_{2}CuO_{4}, see Fig. 3. There is only a small effect: for the Ce containing sample the intensity has been measured as a function of temperature thereby determining the transition temperature from the I-centered high-temperature phase to the Acam phase, T_{I-A}=505(5) K; extrapolation of the intensities measured for the Ce-free sample gives T_{I-A}=450(15) K. The obtained shift in T_{I-A} agrees to a recent measurement on Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} single crystals.[13] Qualitatively the increase of T_{I-A} is explained by the smaller ionic radius of Ce^{4+} and the charge transfer into the planes which should enhance the equilibrium Cu-O distances. Quantitatively, the 15% Ce doping shifts the transition temperature by about +50 K, whereas in the case of La_{2}CuO_{4} the Sr doping by the same amount reduces the transition by about 350 K. The strongly reduced influence of the electronic doping in case of the T^{\prime} phase might indicate that the charge transfer is incomplete in respect to the amount of Ce substitution.

The phase diagram of NTCCO has been established combining the different diffraction techniques with the resistivity and susceptibility measurements, see Fig. 5.[12] The superconducting T_{c} diminishes rapidly with the Tb substitution, superconductivity (SC) could not be detected for Tb concentrations higher than 0.25. For an only slightly higher Tb content we observed the rotation distorted phase, with the characteristic superstructure reflections appearing in electron and neutron diffraction, furthermore the plot of the c lattice parameters obtained at 11 K presents the characteristic kink at 0.36(3). For x = 0.55, 0.60, and 0.65 the transition temperatures were determined on analyzing the superstructure reflection intensities as a function of temperature by means of neutron diffraction; for x = 0.4 the corresponding intensities appeared in the electron-diffraction pattern on cooling. The exclusion between SC and the structural distortion in NTCCO resembles the interplay between superconductivity and the LTT phase in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{x}Sr_{y}CuO_{4}.[5] In the case of (Nd_{1-x}Tb_{x})_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} the superdonducting phase is separated from the rotation phase by a region of nonsuperconducting samples not presenting a long range superstructure. However, the strong difference of the Nd and Tb ionic radii might favor a local distortion in the samples around x = 0.3, which is very difficult to detect in a diffraction experiment.

For several T^{\prime} compounds the appearance of weak ferromagnetism (WFM) has been reported.[14] However, WFM is incompatible with the ideal structure with space group I4/mmm and necessitates a structural distortion. The Acam structure described by the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares easily explains the occurrence of WFM and the alignment of the ferromagnetic moment parallel to the CuO_{2} planes. It, therefore, seems reasonable to assume that all T^{\prime} compounds presenting WFM possess the Acam superstructure. Hence, it is possible to compare the structural distortion in NTCCO to the magnetic phase diagrams of similar systems. Oseroff _et al.[14]_ observe at low temperatures indications for WFM in Eu_{2}CuO_{4}. Our conjecture that Eu_{2}CuO_{4} undergoes a structural phase transformation is supported by the appearance of additional Raman lines.[15] A direct proof of the distortion in Eu_{2}CuO_{4} was recently obtained by neutron diffraction.[16] As Ce increases the transition temperature Eu_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} should present the superstructure, too; however, this compound is still superconducting though its T_{c} is already reduced.[2] Furthermore, Fuchs _et al._ observe SC and WFM in the same Eu_{1.75}Gd_{0.15}CuO_{4} sample.[17] In all published phase diagrams, SC disappears close to the composition where WFM appears, and where a lattice parameter anomaly similar to the one in Fig. 2 is observed.[17, 18, 19, 20] Hence, we suggest the following interpretation: the rotation distortion might not suppress SC but only reduce the T_{c} . However, the increased distortion in the samples with the smallest R's might enhance such an effect leading to the observed suppression.

Such a relation to the SC reflects the continuous character of the rotation transition. Furthermore, it corresponds to the current understanding of the influence of the tilt transition in the LTO-T phase: the LTO tilt was also shown to reduce and not to suppress T_{c}.[21] However, it cannot be ruled out that the suppression of SC in the T^{\prime} compounds with small R's is due to an inefficient or incomplete reduction of the oxygen content. It seems worthwhile to remind that for our samples the reduction step had to be performed at lower temperature for increasing Tb content. So, a less effective reduction appears possible. However, it was verified that the oxygen content has only a minor influence on the rotation transition by analyzing an oxidized sample.[12] Mantharam and Zhu argue that an inherent instability in the case of the smaller ionic radii would prevent a proper reduction.[22]

In conclusion we have analyzed the structural distortion and the superconducting properties in NTCCO. The smaller ionic radius of the Tb ions causes the rotation transition with strong impacts on several bond distances. Especially the

  Cu-O bonds are elongated. The driving force of the transition seems to be more complex in nature than the isotropic bond-length mismatch which can account quantitatively for the tilt transitions in the T phase.

The phase diagram of NTCCO exhibits an exclusion between SC at low-Tb concentrations, and the rotation distorted phase at large concentrations. For some intermediate concentrations neither SC or a long-range structural deformation can be detected. Our data together with the published phase diagrams on the WFM were interpreted by the assumption that the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares reduces T_{c} continuously resulting into a rather strong effect for larger rotation angles. The question whether such an effect is responsible for the nonexistence of SC in R_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} samples with small R's needs further analysis on the role of the oxygen content and on the character of the charge transfer in these compounds.

###### Abstract

The phase diagram of (Nd1-_x_Tb)1.85Ce0.15CuO4 has been studied by resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, x-ray, electron-, and neutron-diffraction experiments. For low-Tb concentrations the samples are superconducting; however, _Tc_ diminishes rapidly with increasing x. For higher Tb concentrations all diffraction studies indicate the long-range lattice deformation characterized by the rotation of the CuO4 squares around the c axis (i.e., the orthorhombic phase recently observed in Gd2CuO4); the structural consequences of the distortion are discussed.

Recently a structural distortion of the _T'_ phase was observed in Gd2CuO4,1 where the CuO4 squares are rotated around the c axis by an angle of 5.2deg at room temperature. The underlying structural phase transition appears to be dominated by the ionic radius of the R since Nd0.38Tb1.62CuO4, which possesses the same averaged ionic radius as Gd2CuO4, presents the identical distortion.1

A similar kink seen in the dependence of the published R_{2}CuO_{4}c parameters on the R ionic radius [7, 8] indicates a general strain order-parameter coupling. For high-Tb concentrations we additionally observe superstructure peaks which can be indexed in a \sqrt{2}a\times\sqrt{2}a\times c lattice in respect to the high-temperature _14/mmm_ structure; for example the (212) reflection is shown in Fig. 3. Rietveld refinements with the patterns obtained with \lambda=2.43 and 1.22 A confirm that the superstructure in the NTCCO samples is identical to the one observed in Gd_{2}CuO_{4} (Ref. [1]) with space group Acam (standard setting Cmca), i.e., the superstructure is characterized by the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares. (In the following this transition will be called rotation transition in contrast to the tilt transitions in the T phase where the axes of rotation lie within the CuO_{2} plane.) As discussed in Ref. [1], the simplest structural distortion due to a CuO_{4} rotation corresponds to the space group Acam. More complex structures correspond to different stacking sequences of the distorted CuO_{2} planes leading to at least a doubling of the c parameter, a situation not supported by the diffraction pattern. The space group I4_{1}/acd which is reported for the similarly distorted Sr_{2}IrO_{4} and Sr_{2}RhO_{4} structures [9], is incompatible with the positions of the superstructure reflections.

The main characteristic of the transition is the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares around c (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 1 in Ref. [1]), which is the order parameter. The T=11 K values scale roughly linearly with (x-x_{c}). Attempts to refine a distortion of the rotated CuO_{4} square gave no improvement compared to the rigid one; therefore, the plane oxygen [O(1)] position was constrained to (0.25+d,0.25-d,0). The upper limit for the splitting of the CuO bond distances can be estimated to 0.01 A. A smaller splitting, even though too small to be detected by powder diffraction, might have a strong impact on the electronic band structure.

As a consequence of the rotation transition at higher Tb contents several bond lengths are strongly modified. The Cu-O(1) distance decreases with increasing Tb content as long as the samples stay in the ideal T^{\prime} structure in accordance with the relatively smaller ionic radius of the Tb ion. For higher Tb contents the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares gives rise to an elongation of the Cu-O(1) bond when compared to the value extrapolated from the I4/mmm plane. In this system with a Ce concentration of 0.15 the Cu-O(1) bond does not go below 1.958 A. The elongation of the Cu-O(1) bond in the distorted phase was also observed for the tilt transition in the T phase [10]. So, a similar bond-length mismatch between the R-O and Cu-O subsystems might be responsible for the rotation transition in the T^{\prime} phase in agreement with the pronounced dependency on the R ionic radius [1, 11]. However, a more detailed analysis with respect to the rather an

  isotropic coordinations reveals a more complex driving mechanism.[12]

The influence of Ce doping on the transition has been studied by comparing the superstructure reflection intensities in (Nd_{0.35}Tb_{0.65})_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} and (Nd_{0.35}Tb_{0.65})_{2}CuO_{4}, see Fig. 3. There is only a small effect: for the Ce containing sample the intensity has been measured as a function of temperature thereby determining the transition temperature from the I-centered high-temperature phase to the Acam phase, T_{I-A}=505(5) K; extrapolation of the intensities measured for the Ce-free sample gives T_{I-A}=450(15) K. The obtained shift in T_{I-A} agrees to a recent measurement on Gd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} single crystals.[13] Qualitatively the increase of T_{I-A} is explained by the smaller ionic radius of Ce^{4+} and the charge transfer into the planes which should enhance the equilibrium Cu-O distances. Quantitatively, the 15% Ce doping shifts the transition temperature by about +50 K, whereas in the case of La_{2}CuO_{4} the Sr doping by the same amount reduces the transition by about 350 K. The strongly reduced influence of the electronic doping in case of the T^{\prime} phase might indicate that the charge transfer is incomplete in respect to the amount of Ce substitution.

The phase diagram of NTCCO has been established combining the different diffraction techniques with the resistivity and susceptibility measurements, see Fig. 5.[12] The superconducting T_{c} diminishes rapidly with the Tb substitution, superconductivity (SC) could not be detected for Tb concentrations higher than 0.25. For an only slightly higher Tb content we observed the rotation distorted phase, with the characteristic superstructure reflections appearing in electron and neutron diffraction, furthermore the plot of the c lattice parameters obtained at 11 K presents the characteristic kink at 0.36(3). For x = 0.55, 0.60, and 0.65 the transition temperatures were determined on analyzing the superstructure reflection intensities as a function of temperature by means of neutron diffraction; for x = 0.4 the corresponding intensities appeared in the electron-diffraction pattern on cooling. The exclusion between SC and the structural distortion in NTCCO resembles the interplay between superconductivity and the LTT phase in La_{2-x-y}Nd_{x}Sr_{y}CuO_{4}.[5] In the case of (Nd_{1-x}Tb_{x})_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} the superdonducting phase is separated from the rotation phase by a region of nonsuperconducting samples not presenting a long range superstructure. However, the strong difference of the Nd and Tb ionic radii might favor a local distortion in the samples around x = 0.3, which is very difficult to detect in a diffraction experiment.

For several T^{\prime} compounds the appearance of weak ferromagnetism (WFM) has been reported.[14] However, WFM is incompatible with the ideal structure with space group I4/mmm and necessitates a structural distortion. The Acam structure described by the rotation of the CuO_{4} squares easily explains the occurrence of WFM and the alignment of the ferromagnetic moment parallel to the CuO_{2} planes. It, therefore, seems reasonable to assume that all T^{\prime} compounds presenting WFM possess the Acam superstructure. Hence, it is possible to compare the structural distortion in NTCCO to the magnetic phase diagrams of similar systems. Oseroff _et al.[14]_ observe at low temperatures indications for WFM in Eu_{2}CuO_{4}. Our conjecture that Eu_{2}CuO_{4} undergoes a structural phase transformation is supported by the appearance of additional Raman lines.[15] A direct proof of the distortion in Eu_{2}CuO_{4} was recently obtained by neutron diffraction.[16] As Ce increases the transition temperature Eu_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4} should present the superstructure, too; however, this compound is still superconducting though its T_{c} is already reduced.[2] Furthermore, Fuchs _et al._ observe SC and WFM in the same Eu_{1.75}Gd_{0.15}CuO_{4} sample.[17] In all published phase diagrams, SC disappears close to the composition where WFM appears, and where a lattice parameter anomaly similar to the one in Fig. 2 is observed.[17, 18, 19, 20] Hence, we suggest the following interpretation: the rotation distortion might not suppress SC but only reduce the T_{c} .
