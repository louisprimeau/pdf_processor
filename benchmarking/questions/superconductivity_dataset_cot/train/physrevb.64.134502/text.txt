###### Abstract

The isothermal magnetization curves obtained from a superconducting _T_*-phase SmLa0.8Sr0.2CuO4-_d_ single crystal have demonstrated the existence of distinct peak effect in a large temperature range, persisting up to the vicinity of the superconducting critical temperature (\(T_{c}^{\rm eq}\)=24 K). The magnetization curves also exhibit the remarkable feature of zero-field peaking and its enhancement at lower temperature. Analysis of the associated vortex phase diagram further establishes the role of geometrical barrier in the retardation of vortex penetration at high temperature and that of surface barrier at lower temperature. The temperature dependence of the second peak field is also found to conform with existing models at the appropriate temperature regimes. Additionally, the irreversibility line shows a sign reversal of its slope at a field position around \(H_{\rm 2D}\) indicating two-dimensional melting at higher field. Nevertheless, the temperature dependent behavior of the second peak onset field is at variance with other published results and defies explanation on the basis of existing theoretical models.

 range of magnetic phase up to its normal state. Given its additional advantage of having a single layer of CuO\({}_{2}\), this system serves as an ideal model for the much needed study of structure-property correlation.

Up till now, most research works on this 214 system have been devoted to the \(T\) and _T'_ phases, presumably due to greater obstacle in obtaining a good quality single crystal of the _T*_ phase. On the other hand, the study of the _T*_ phase is likely to provide additional insight to the understanding of the peak effect and other related properties due to its unique structure embedding two different phases in one system. Being a hybrid of \(T\) phase [(La1-Sr)2CuO4-d] and _T'_ phase (Sm2CuO4-d), this system is expected to exhibit interesting new features in its vortex phase structure and the associated transitional behaviors. This will in turn provide additional experimental data for the study of structure-property correlation. With this hope in mind, we have undertaken the task of growing the single crystal of _T*_ phase SmLa1-Sr,CuO4-d for the study of its vortex behavior. In this paper, we report the results of magnetic measurements of a SmLa0,Sr0,CuO4-d single crystal, demonstrating the fishtail effect in a large temperature range below _Tc_ . It will be shown that most of these magnetization data do conform with the existing models, while others, such as the onset field of the second peak effect, are clearly in need of further theoretical and experimental studies.

## Experiments

Single crystals of SmLa0,Sr0,CuO4-d were grown by the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method using a four-mirror furnace from Crystal System, Inc. A crystal with dimensions of ~2.0x2.0x0.9 mm3 and a mass of ~23 mg was obtained by cleaving the as-cut crystal in air along the _ab_ plane. The superconductivity of the crystal was attained by annealing the as grown crystal in 200 bar oxygen at 600 degC for 7 days, followed by another heat treatment at 300 degC for 3 days before being cooled slowly to room temperature at a rate of 25 degC/hr. The onset of the critical transition temperature after this oxidation process is found to be \(T_{c}^{\text{on}} \approx 24\) K with D_Tc_  3 K as depicted by the _M -T_ curve in Fig. 1. Details on this crystal growth process, its oxidation effect and structural characterization of the crystal will be published elsewhere. [40]

A series of isothermal magnetic measurements were performed with the external magnetic field \(H\) applied parallel to the \(c\) axis of the crystal using a commercial Quantum Design MPMS-5 magnetometer. To ensure field homogeneity during the measurement, a scan length of 4 cm was used, and each measurement was started after cooling the sample in zero field (ZFC mode) to the predetermined temperature.

## Results of measurement

The data presented in Figs. 2\(-\)6 are the results of isothermal magnetization loop measurement carried out over the temperature range from 2 to 20 K, at a temperature interval of 1 K. The _M_(_H_)_T_ curves obtained clearly separate into two groups associated, respectively, with the temperature regions of 9 <= \(T\) <= 20 K (Figs. 2\(-\)4) and 2 <= \(T\) <= 8 K (Figs. 5,6). In the higher temperature region, a distinct second peak is observed on each of the magnetization curves with varying position and magnitude. The position of this second peak _H_SP together with those of the onsets of field penetration _Hp_ , the onset of the second peak effect _H_on as well as the irreversible field _H_ir are indicated in Fig. 2 for easy identification. The penetration field _Hp_ is determined as the first minimum of magnetization on the curve, the onset field of peak effect _H_on as the first maximum and the second peak field _H_SP as the second minimum on the curve. The irreversibility field _H_ir is determined from the _M_(_H_)_T_ curves as the point where the difference between the values of the magnetization for in

  creasing and decreasing field begins to deviate from zero to within the accuracy of the experiment (\(\pm\,5\times 10^{-6}\) emu). We note that a near perfect mirror symmetry between the ascending and descending branches of the hysteresis loop clearly features on all the curves in this temperature region. As we enter the lower temperature region (\(T\)\(<\)9 K), the peak effect on the ascending branch becomes weaker with decreasing temperature, while the mirror symmetry mentioned earlier fades away concurrently.

In this temperature range, the penetration field \(H_{p}\) appears more similar to a kink instead of a peak, similar to the result reported for Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6}\) single crystal.[26] A closer look at the field above \(H_{p}\) reveals a curvature change located slightly above \(H_{p}\) . This is identified as the onset of a second peak field, determined as the point of inflection satisfying \(d^{2}M/dH^{2}\)\(=\) 0 as illustrated by the inset in Fig. 6.

In order to facilitate the following analysis and discussion of the experimental results, the characteristic fields (\(H_{p}\) , \(H_{\rm on}\) , \(H_{\rm SP}\) , and \(H_{\rm irr}\)) on each magnetization curve have been

The result is given in Fig. 7, which indicates the separation of the entire solid phase area into a number of distinct regions bounded by the associated "phase lines." These experimental curves are the objects of our analysis and discussion on the basis of existing models.

## 5 Analysis and discussion

We note that the data of penetration field in Fig. 7 show a general trend of increasing \(H_{p}\) with decreasing temperature. It is well known that this general temperature dependent behavior of \(H_{p}\) has been theoretically predicted by the surface barrier model [41] as well as the geometrical barrier model [42] and experimentally verified in several systems [10, 11, 15, 29, 43] and different temperature ranges. [8, 20, 21, 44] The surface barrier model predicts for a strongly layered system a functional relation of the form \(H_{p}(T) = H_{c}\exp( - T/T_{0})\) where \(T_{0}\) is a constant. For a less anisotropic (quasi-3D) system, this model yields the approximate expression \(H_{p}(T)\)\(\propto (T_{c} - T)^{3/2}/T\) for \(H_{p} < H_{c}\). On the other hand, the geometrical barrier model leads to a penetration field \(H_{p}\) having the temperature dependence given by \(H_{p}(T) = H_{p}(0)(1 - T/T_{c})\), which is expected to be dominant at elevated temperature. The results of best fit to our data on the basis of these models are depicted in the figure. It is seen that the data for \(T \geq 14\) K are closely fitted by the geometrical barrier model with \(H_{p}(0) = 116\) Oe and \(T_{c} = 26.3\) K which begins to deviate from the data below 14 K. This result confirms previous observations on Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4\({}_{4 - \delta}\) (Ref. [8]) and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Refs. [20, 21, 42]) crystals in the elevated temperature regime.

In the lower-temperature regime where the bulk pinning and surface barrier are supposed to be important we have found a good fit with the exponential function with \(H_{c}\) = 377 Oe and \(T_{c} = 7.5\) K, as observed previously on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, [15, 20, 21] Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8, [15, 43] Nd2 - \(X_{c}\)CeCuO4 - \(\delta\), [10, 11] and HgBa 2CuO4 (Ref. [29]) crystals, but failed to fit the quasi 3D relation in contrast to previous observation reported on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 by Niderost _et al._[44] It must be noted, however, that perceptible deviation from the exponential function does occur at the lower end of the temperature range. This may well be attributed to the significant bulk pinning at low temperature below 5 K explaining the need of a higher external field for its effective penetration into the sample. It is not clear whether this deviation mainly manifest the effect of bulk pinning or may have some contribution from the measurement conducted at a faster pace below 5 K as pointed out in an earlier report. [44]

Further, let us turn our attention to the insets of Figs. 3, 4, and 5, where the descending magnetization curves exhibit sharp peaks at a negative field close to zero. The "zero-field" peaks observed in magnetization curves of high-temperature superconductors [45] were theoretically explained by Zeldov _et al._ as an important effect of geometrical barrier in the sample, which becomes significantly enhanced in the presence of Bean Livingston surface barrier. [42] Our data of the zero-field peak as displayed in those insets in terms of its normalized value with respect to magnetization at the corresponding \(H_{p}\) also show its enhancement at lower temperature where the surface barrier is expected to become operative. These observations constitute a clear support for the theoretical description of Zeldov _et al._[42]

We turn next to the \(H_{\text{on}}\) curve located slightly above \(H_{p}\). As mentioned earlier, this curve marks the onset of the fishtail effect which is commonly associated with a transition between two solid phases. A recent model proposed by Giller _et al._[9] describes the effect as a disorder-induced transition, taking place at a field determined by the competition between the vortex elastic energy \(E_{\text{elastic}}\) and the pinning energy \(E_{\text{pinning}}\). The elastic interaction at low field governs the structure of the vortex solid leading to the formation of a quasi-ordered lattice (Bragg glass), while disorder becomes dominant at high field where the interaction between the vortices and the pinning centers results in an entangled solid (vortex glass). [36, 37, 38, 39] According to this model, the characteristic cross over field \(H_{\text{on}}\) has a temperature dependence of the form \(H_{\text{on}}(T) = H_{\text{on}}(0)\{[ 1 - (T/T_{c})^{4}\rbrack^{3/2}\). We have found that this functional relationship, showing an opposite curvature, can hardly fit our data, as was reported previously for the systems of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4\({}_{4 - \delta}\) (Ref. [11]) and (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8 + \(\delta\). [24] On the other hand, our data in the temperature range of 4 - 20 K are much better fitted by an exponential function of \(H_{\text{on}}(T) = H_{a}\exp( T_{a}/T)\), with \(H_{a}\) = 50 Oe and \(T_{a} = 11\) K. It is worth noting that this curve extrapolates at both ends of the temperature range toward the \(H_{\text{SP}}\) field at temperatures where the peak effect is supposed to disappear completely. We recall that this is precisely the phenomenon depicted in Fig. 5. This exponential \(T\)-dependent behavior is nevertheless in direct contrast to the exponential dependence of \(H_{\text{on}}(T) = H_{0}\exp( - T/T_{0})\) reported for Tl2Ba2CuO6 (Ref. [27]) and HgBa2CuO4 (Ref. [29]) sys

The theoretical fits of these transition lines are indicated by either the dotted, dashed, and solid lines for easy distinction. See text for discussions.

  tems. To the best of our knowledge, explanations of these different results are not available from the existing theoretical models.

The data of second peak field _H_sp(_T_) is examined on the basis of thermal decoupling theory.22,39,46-49 This theory predicts the suppression of superconducting long-range order in the direction of the applied field due to thermal fluctuation of the pancake vortices, leading to the decoupling of the pancake vortex layers. In the (Sm,La,Sr)2CuO4 crystal, the moderate value of anisotropy parameter g satisfies the condition \(\xi_{ab}{\leq}\gamma{s^{\ast}}{\leq}\Lambda_{ab}\), where g_ab_ and l_ab_ are the in-plane coherence length and penetration depth, respectively, while \(s\) is the CuO2 interlayer distance. Assuming a mean-field temperature dependence of \(\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T) = \lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)/(1 - T/T_{c})\), the decoupling field \(H_{d}\) is then given by46,47\(H_{d}(T) = \Phi_{0}^{3}/[16\,\pi^{2}e\,k_{B}\mu_{0}\,\varsigma^{2}\,T_{\Delta}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)\)], with Ph0 denoting the flux quantum (2.07 x 10-15 Wb), _kB_ the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10-23 J/K), and m0 the permeability of free space (4 \(p\) x 10-7 H/m). Based on this model the second peak field is supposed to have a temperature dependence of _H_sp(_T_) = _H_sp(_T_c/_T_) - 1 with \(H_{\text{sp}}^{\ast}\) = \(\Phi_{0}^{3}/[16\,\pi^{2}e\,k_{B}\mu_{0}\varsigma^{2}\,T_{\Delta}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(0)\)]. This function can be nicely fitted to the data points with the value of \(H_{\text{sp}}^{\ast}\) = 430 Oe and _T_c = 24.6 K. This result indicates that the second peak effect, weakening at high temperatures in the _T_* phase of SmLa08Sr02CuO4 - \(s\), has its origin in the thermal disorder-induced interlayer decoupling. A similar analysis was reported on an overdoped (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8 + \(s\) (Ref. [22]) and qualitatively on Tl2Ba2CuO6 (Ref. [27]) single crystals. Substituting the parameter \(s\) in the theoretical expression of \(H_{\text{sp}}^{\ast}\) by the value \(s\) = \(c\)  12.60 A obtained from the refinement analysis of XRD pattern,40 we arrive at the zero temperature in-plane penetration depth of l_ab_(0) >= 3634 A. This value is very close to that of \(T\) phase La1,875Sr02,125CuO4 - \(s\).50 It must be stressed nevertheless, that the lower-temperature part of the second peak data (_T_ <= 5 K) is better described by an exponential function of _H_sp(_T_) = 5500 exp(_-T_4) in conformity with the expression \(H_{\text{sp}}(T) = H_{\text{sp}}(0)\) exp(_-_a_T_/_T_c_) as adopted in the previous analysis of Tl-based single crystal26,28 and (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8 + \(s\) single crystal.24 This different behavior in the lower-temperature region (_T_ <= 5 K) is most likely a manifestation of a different pinning mechanism as a consequence of diminishing role of thermal energy.

The temperature dependence of the irreversibility line _H_ir(_T_) as depicted in Fig. 7 shows a curvature reversal around 10 K, from negative curvature at higher temperature-low field region to positive curvature at lower temperature-high field region. The data in the higher temperature region (10 = \(T\) <= 20 K) displays an excellent fit to the theoretical curve given by \(H_{\text{irr}}(T) = H_{\text{irr}}(0)(1 - T/T_{c})^{3/2}\) with _H_ir(0) = 15 kOe and _T_c = 22.5 K. This temperature dependency is supposed to indicate the dominance of thermal effect as predicted by the giant flux creep models of Yeshurun51 and Tinkham.52 In the lower temperature region (_T_ < 10 K), the _H_ir curve exhibiting positive curvature is very well fitted by an exponentially dependence of the form _H_ir(_T_) = _H_ir exp(_b_/_T_), with _H_m = 2500 Oe and _b =_ 11 K. This behavior has been suggested in the quasi 2D Josephson coupled layer-superconductor (JCLS) model with moderate anisotropy.53 It is tempting at this point to consider the empirical formula proposed by Kitazawa _et al._,54 which relates the anisotropy parameter g to the measured irreversibility field _H_irr(_T_), namely, \(H_{\text{irr}}(T) = 33\,400/\gamma^{2}(1 - T/T_{c})^{m}\). This empirical equation is based on the consideration that the cuprate HTSC compound can be viewed universally as a system of alternating insulating/blocking and superconducting layers.55 In such a system, the associated anisotropy is expected to control various electromagnetic phenomena including flux pinning strength. Equating the multiplicative factor in this equation with the _H_ir(0), obtained above from the constant factor of the irreversibility line in the higher-temperature region, yields the value of g~47 which lies between those of (La,Sr)2CuO4 - \(s\) system (g = 14-63) (Ref. [54]) and (Nd,Ce)2CuO4 - \(s\) system (g = 30-100).56

A rough estimation of dimensional crossover field (3D-quasi 2D crossover) \(H\)2D following the approximate formula47\(H_{\text{2D}}{\approx}\,\Phi_{0}/\lambda_{f}^{2}\) with l_j = _ys_ and g~47 yields the value \(H\)2D(r = 6000 Oe. Looking at the _H_-_T_ phase diagram, this \(H\)2D value is located approximately at the field where the _H_ir curve undergoes sign reversal in its slope, marking the onset of weakening interlayer coupling and indicating 2D melting at higher field. This view is consistent with steep rise of _H_ir(_T_) for \(H\) > \(H\)2D, approaching the well known theoretical prediction of field independent melting line _H_m(_T_) for the strongly layered 2D system.53 Although the dimensional crossover \(H\)2D given above is strictly valid only in the low-temperature region far away from _T_c, the near coincidence between \(H\)2D and the curvature reversal of _H_ir(_T_) is nevertheless an interesting point to note in the context explained above.

The estimation of the out-of-plane penetration depth at zero temperature l_c(0) based on the estimated anisotropy parameter g and zero temperature in-plane penetration depth l_ab_(0) according to the general formula g= l_c/l_ab_ yields l_c(0)  17.08 _m_m_. This value is smaller than the one observed from optical measurement obtained from the same batch of crystals under different oxygen annealing treatment, namely l_c(3_K_)  45 \(m\).57 We are inclined to attribute this discrepancy to different carrier doping levels in these two crystals, in congruence with different anisotropy parameters and different critical temperatures. The crystal used for optical measurement is known as a strongly underdoped sample (_T_c  16 K), while our sample is approximately in the optimal doping state (_T_c  24 K).

## Conclusion

We have demonstrated from the isothermal magnetization data of SmLa08Sr02CuO4 - \(s\) single crystal with \(T_{c}^{\text{on}_{\infty}}\)24 K that this system exhibits the well known peak effect in a large temperature range, extending from 2 to 20 K. Additionally, the magnetization data also reveal remarkable zero-field peak throughout most of the same temperature range, with perceptible enhancement at lower temperatures. Analysis of the magnetic phase diagram derived from these data on the basis of an existing models clearly indicates the role of geometrical barrier in the retardation of vortex penetration at  elevated temperature range, and that of surface barrier at lower temperature. We have also found that most of the data in various temperature and field regions can be well described with the existing theoretical models. In particular, a slope change of the irreversibility line at the field position around \(H_{\rm 2D}\) confirms the 2D melting characteristics at \(H\)\(>\)\(H_{\rm 2D}\). One exception is the temperature dependent behavior of the second peak onset field \(H_{\rm on}(T)\) which appears to defy explanation by any model known to the authors. Further, estimations of the anisotropy parameter and penetration depth at zero temperature have also been made, yielding a value between those of \(T\) and \(T^{{}^{\prime}}\) 214 systems, and thereby provide further indication of the different features occurring in this \(T^{*}\) phase compared to the other 214 compounds.
