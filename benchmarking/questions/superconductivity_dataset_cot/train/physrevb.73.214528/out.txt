###### Abstract

Measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda in the ternary boride superconductor Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (T_{c} =7.3 K) have been carried out by means of muon-spin rotation (\muSR). The absolute values of \lambda, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, and the first H_{c1} and second H_{c2} critical fields at T=0 obtained from \muSR were found to be \lambda(0) = 252(2) nm, \kappa(0) = 27(1), \mu_{0}H_{c1}(0) = 9.5(1) mT, and \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.66(8) T, respectively. The zero-temperature value of the superconducting gap \Delta_{0}=1.31(3) meV was found, corresponding to the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.0(1). At low temperatures \lambda(T) saturates and becomes constant below T= 0.2T_{c}, in agreement with what is expected for s-wave BCS superconductors. Our results suggest that Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is a s-wave BCS superconductor with only one isotropic energy gap.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the ternary boride superconductors Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B has attracted considerable interest in the study of these materials.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] It is believed now that superconductivity in both the above-mentioned compounds is most likely mediated by phonons. It stems from photoemission,[3] nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),[4] and specific heat experiments.[6] Moreover, the observation of a Hebel-Slichter peak in the ^{11}B spin-lattice relaxation rate in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B strongly supports singlet pairing.[4] However, experimental results concerning the structure of the superconducting energy gap are still controversal. On the one hand, NMR data of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (Ref. [4]) and specific heat data of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (Ref. [6]) can be well explained assuming conventional superconductivity. On the other hand, recent measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda suggest unconventional behavior of both compounds, namely, double-gap superconductivity in Li_{3}Pd_{2}B and nodes in the energy gap in Li_{3}Pt_{2}B.[5, 7] This contradiction is serious and shows that further experimental investigations of these compounds are needed.

In this paper, we report a systematic study of magnetic field penetration depth \lambda in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B by means of transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF-\muSR) (the detailed description of the TF-\muSR technique in connection with \lambda studies can be found, e.g., in Ref. [8]). Measurements were performed down to 30 mK in a series of fields ranging from 0.02 to 2.3 T. For all magnetic fields studied (0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2.3 T) no sign of a second superconducting gap was detected. All our results may be well explained by assuming conventional superconductivity with only _one isotropic_ energy gap. The absolute values of \lambda, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, and the first (H_{c1}) and second (H_{c2}) critical fields at T=0 obtained from \muSR were found to be \lambda(0) = 252(2) nm, \kappa(0) = 27(1), \mu_{0}H_{c1}(0) = 9.5(1) mT, and \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.66(8) T, respectively. The zero temperature value of the superconducting gap \Delta_{0} was found to be 1.31(3) meV that corresponds to the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.0(1).

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we describe the sample preparation procedure and the TF-\muSR technique in connection with \lambda(T) measurements. In Sec. III A we discuss the temperature dependence of the second critical field H_{c2}. In Sec. III B we present the calculation of the absolute value of \lambda and the magnetic field dependence of the second moment of the \muSR line. Section III.3 comprises studies of the temperature dependence of \lambda. The conclusions follow in Sec. IV.

## II Experimental Details

The Li_{2}Pd_{3}B polycrystalline sample was prepared by two-step arc melting.[1] First, a binary Pd_{3}B alloy was prepared by conventional arc melting from the mixture of Pd(99.9% ) and B(99.5% ). The alloying of Li was done in the second arc melting, in which a small piece of Pd_{3}B alloy was placed on a Li(>99 % ) plate. Once the Pd_{3}B alloy melted, the reaction with Li occurred and developed very fast, forming a small button specimen (around 300 mg). Since the loss of Li was inevitable, the Li concentration in the final sample was estimated from the weight change. The deviation of the Li concentration from the stoichiometric one was less than 1% for the specimens used in this experiment.

Field-cooled magnetization (M_{\rm FC}) measurements were performed with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in fields ranging from 0.5 mT to 4 T and temperatures between 1.75 and 10 K. The M_{\rm FC}(T) curve for \mu_{0}H=0.5 mT is shown in Fig. 1. The superconducting transition is rather broad indicating that the sample is not particularly uniform, i.e., the superconducting transition temperature may be evaluated only approximately. The middle point of the transition corresponds to T_{c}^{\rm(mp)}=7.1 K, while the linear extrapolation of the steepest part of the M(T) curve to M=0 results in T_{c}^{\rm(ext)}= 7.6 K (see Fig. 1).

TF-\muSR experiments were performed at the \piM3 beam line at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The Li_{2}Pd_{3}B sample was field cooled from above T_{c} down to 30 mK in fields of 2.3, 1, and 0.5 T, and down to \simeq 1.6 K in fields of 0.1 and 0.02 T. In the transverse-field geometry the local magnetic field distribution P(B) inside the superconducting sample in the mixed state, probed by means of the TF-\muSR technique, is determined by the values of the coherence length \xi and the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda. In extreme type-II superconductors (\lambda \gg \xi) the P(B) distribution is almost independent on \xi and the second moment of P(B) line becomes simply proportional to 1/\lambda^{4}.[9, 10]

The \muSR signal was recorded in the usual time-differential way by counting positrons from decaying muons as a function of time. The time dependence of the positron rate is given by the expression[11]

\[N(t)=N_{0}\frac{1}{\tau_{\mu}}e^{-t/\tau_{\mu}}[1+aP(t)]+bg\,,\] (1)

where N_{0} is the normalization constant, bg denotes the time-independent background, \tau_{\mu}=2.19703(4) x 10-6 s is the muon lifetime, a is the maximum decay asymmetry for the particular detector telescope (a \sim 0.18 in our case), and P(t) is the polarization of the muon ensemble

\[P(t)=\int\,P(B)\mathrm{cos}(\gamma_{\mu}Bt+\phi)dB\,.\] (2)

Here \gamma_{\mu}=2 \pi x 135.5342 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio and \phi is the angle between the initial muon polarization and the effective symmetry axis of a positron detector. P(t) can be linked to the internal field distribution P(B) by using the algorithm of Fourier transform.[11]

The P(t) and P(B) distributions inside the Li_{2}Pd_{3}B sample in the normal (T = 8.5 K) and in the mixed state (T = 2 K) after field cooling in a magnetic field of 0.1 T are shown in Fig. 2. The P(B) distributions were obtained from the measured P(t) by using the fast Fourier transform procedure based on the maximum entropy algorithm.[12] In the normal state, a symmetric line at the position of the external magnetic field with a broadening arising from the nuclear magnetic moments is seen. Below T_{c} the field distribution is broadened and asymmetric. In order to account for the asymmetric field distribution, \muSR time spectra obtained below T_{c} were fitted by two Gaussian lines[13, 14]

\[P(t)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2}A_{i}\,\exp(-\,\sigma_{i}^{2}t^{2}/2)\mathrm{cos}( \gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t+\phi)\,,\] (3)

where A_{i}, \sigma_{i}, and B_{i} are the asymmetry, the Gaussian relaxation rate, and the first moment of the i-th line, respectively. At T>T_{c}, the analysis is simplified to a single line with \sigma_{\mathrm{mm}}\sim 0.1 MHz arising from the nuclear moments of the sample. Equation (3) is equivalent to the field distribution[14]

\[P(B)=\gamma_{\mu}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}}{\sigma_{i}}\,\exp(-\,\frac{ \gamma_{\mu}^{2}(B-B_{i})^{2}}{2\sigma_{i}^{2}})\,.\] (4)

  \muSR time spectra. The corresponding P(B) lines are shown in Figs. 2(c). For this distribution the mean field and the second moment are [14]

\[\langle B\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}B_{i}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}\] (5)

and

\[\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\gamma_{\mu}^{2}}=\sum_{i=1}^{2} \frac{A_{i}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}\Bigg{[}\frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}}{\gamma_{\mu}^{2}}+[B_{ i}-\langle B\rangle]^{2}\Bigg{]}.\] (6)

The superconducting part of the square root of the second moment \sigma_{\rm sc} was then obtained by subtracting the contribution of nuclear moments \sigma_{\rm nm} measured at T>T_{c} as \sigma_{\rm sc}^{2} = \sigma^{2} = -\sigma_{\rm nm}^{2}. From the known value of \sigma_{\rm sc} the absolute value of \lambda can be evaluated using the following relation:

\[\sigma_{\rm sc}[\mu{\rm s}^{-1}] = 4.83\times 10^{4}(1-H/H_{c2})[1+1.21(1\] (7) \[-\sqrt{H/H_{c2}})^{3}]\lambda\text{-}^{2}[{\rm nm}],\]

which describes the field variation of \sigma_{\rm sc} for an ideal triangular vortex lattice. [10] Note, that according to Ref. [10], Eq. (7) does not hold for very low magnetic inductions.

## III III. Experimental results and discussion

### A. Temperature dependence of the upper critical field

The field-cooled magnetization M_{\rm FC}(T) curves for several magnetic fields H are shown in Fig. 3. For each particular field H the corresponding transition temperature T_{c}(H) was taken as an intersect of the linear extrapolation of the steepest part of the M_{\rm FC}(H) curve with M = 0 line. The resulting H_{c2}(T) dependence is presented in Fig. 4. It is seen that H_{c2}(T) data can be satisfactorily fitted with the model provided by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory. [15] The fit yields H_{c2}(0) = 3.58(10) T and T_{c} = 7.25 K. Note, that the value of the transition temperature obtained from the fit lies between T_{c}^{\rm(mp)} and T_{c}^{\rm(ext)}introduced in Fig. 1, i.e., it is in agreement with low-field magnetization measurements. In the following, the H_{c2}(T) curve presented in Fig. 4 is used to analyze the \muSR data (see Sec. III.3).

To summarize, the temperature dependence of the second critical field can be well described within the WHH theory. The absolute value of the second critical field at T = 0 was found to be 3.58(10) T in agreement with results of Badica _et al._[2]

### B. Magnetic field dependence of the second moment of \muSR line

In Fig. 5(a) the temperature dependences of \sigma_{\rm sc} for \mu_{0}H = 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2.3 T are shown. For \mu_{0}H = 0.5, 1, and 2.3 T, \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) was measured down to 30 mK. It is seen, that below 1.5 K \sigma_{\rm sc} is practically temperature independent [Fig. 5(b)]. Bearing in mind that the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\rm sc} saturates at low temperatures, the values of \sigma_{\rm sc}(T = 0) can be reliably evaluated for all magnetic fields. The results are plotted in Fig. 6 as a function of H. For \mu_{0}H=0.5, 1.0, and 2.3 T \sigma_{\rm sc}(0) was obtained from the zero slope linear fit of the T\leq 1.5 K data [see Fig. 5(b)] and for \mu_{0}H=0.02 and 0.1 T \sigma_{\rm sc}(0) was assumed to be equal to \sigma_{\rm sc} at the lowest measured temperature (T\approx 1.55 K). The solid line in Fig. 6 represents the result of the fit of Eq. (7) to the experimental data with H_{c2}(0)= 3.66(8) T and \lambda(0) = 252(2) nm. As it was already mentioned above, Eq. (7) does not hold for very low magnetic fields. For this reason the data point for \mu_{0}H= 0.02 T was excluded from the fit. It is seen (Fig. 6), that the theoretical curve perfectly matches all data points for \mu_{0}H\geq 0.1 T. The value of \sigma_{\rm sc} for \mu_{0}H=0.02 T lies slightly below the theoretical curve, as expected. It is important to emphasize that the value of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.66(8) T obtained from the fit of \sigma_{\rm sc}(0,H) data coincides within the error with \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.58(10) T, evaluated in the previous section from the directly measured H_{c2}(T). This good agreement between the values of H_{c2}, obtained from the two completely

  different experiments, demonstrates the validity of our analysis.

The above-presented experiments show unambiguously that l, evaluated from _m_SR measurements, is _magnetic field independent_, as one would expect in case of a conventional superconductor with isotropic energy gap.[16] On the other hand, in superconductors with nodes in the gap and isotropic double-gap superconductors like MgB_{2}, l, evaluated in the same way, increases with increasing magnetic field (see, e.g., Refs. [13], [16], and [17]). Thus, the fact, that the \sigma_{\rm sc}(0) versus H dependence is perfectly described by the field independent l (see Fig. 6), implies that Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is a _conventional single-gap_ superconductor.

The zero-temperature value of the superconducting coherence length \xi(0) may be estimated from H_{c2}(0) as \xi(0) =[\Phi_{0}/2\,\pi H_{c2}(0)]0.[5], which results in \xi(0) = 9.5(2) nm (\Phi_{0} is the magnetic flux quantum). Using the values of l(0) and \xi(0), one can evaluate the zero-temperature value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa(0) = l(0)/\xi(0) \approx 27(1). The value of the first critical field can be calculated by means of Eq. (4) from Ref. [10] as \mu_{0}H_{c1} = 9.5(1) mT. It is remarkable that all superconducting characteristics of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B could be obtained solely from _m_SR experiments.

To summarize, the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting part of the _m_SR depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm sc} is well described within the Ginzburg-Landau theory for anisotropic single-gap superconductors. The zero-temperature values of the first and second critical fields, the magnetic penetration depth, the coherence length, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter were found to be \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.66(8) T, \mu_{0}H_{c1} = 9.5(1) mT, l(0) = 252(2) nm, \xi(0) = 9.5(2) nm, and \kappa = 27(1), respectively.

### Temperature dependence of l

Equation (7) implies that \sigma_{\rm sc} depends on l and the reduced magnetic field H/H_{c2}. It is also clear that \sigma_{\rm sc} vanishes for H \congH_{c2}(T). This means that in order to obtain the temperature dependence of l from the \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) curves, the temperature dependence of H/H_{c2} must be taken into account. In our calculations, the H_{c2}(T) curve provided by the solid line in Fig. 4 was used. Due to the known value of \kappa = 27(1), we are not limited by Eq. (7) but can directly apply the numerical calculations of Brandt.[10] In this case, the results collected in the lowest magnetic field (\mu_{0}H = 0.02 T) can also be used. The resulting temperature dependence of l is shown in Fig. 7. Remarkably, all l points, reconstructed from \sigma_{\rm sc} measured in various magnetic fields, collapse onto a single l(T) curve. It should be emphasized that in this reconstruction no adjustable parameter was used. The \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) dependences were obtained by means of _m_SR, while the H_{c2}(T) curve was measured in a completely different set of magnetization experiments (see Sec. III.1).

Considering the temperature dependence of l, one should note that it can be better described by the BCS theory for a moderate coupling with the zero-temperature energy gap 2\Delta_{0} = 4.0(1)k_{B}T_{c} [\Delta(0) = 1.31(3) meV] rather than for the weak coupling limit. This is in agreement with the value 2\Delta_{0} = 3.94k_{B}T_{c} obtained recently from specific-heat measurements.[6] The upward deviations of the experimental data points from the theoretical curve at higher temperatures (see Fig. 7) is expected for nonuniform samples (e.g., for the samples where the transition temperatures are distributed via a certain range \Delta T_{c}). At temperatures close to T_{c}\sim^{2} \sim (T_{c}-T). Assuming that the critical temperature varies throughout the sample from T_{c0} -\Delta T_{c} to T_{c0}, then the relative variation of l^{\sim}T <T_{c0} -\Delta T_{c} is proportional to [1 -\Delta T_{c}/(T_{c0}

  -T)]^{-1}, i.e., it increases with increasing temperature. The value of \sigma, resulting from \muSR experiments in the case of nonuniform samples, may be written as \sigma^{2}= 1/V_{0}\int\sigma_{\rm local}^{2}dV (\sigma_{\rm local} is the local value of \sigma in the unit volume dV and V_{0} is the sample volume). Taking into account that \sigma_{\rm local}\sim 1/\lambda_{\rm local}^{4} this averaging implies that the parts of the sample with the smallest values of \lambda (the highest values of T_{c}) provide the main contribution to \sigma_{\rm sc}. At lower temperatures, however, \lambda become more uniform throughout the sample and \sigma_{\rm sc} can be used for reliable calculations of \lambda(T).

Recently, Yuan _et al._ studied the magnetic field penetration depth in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B by means of self-inductance technique.[5, 6] It was obtained that a considerable increase of \lambda starts already at temperatures well below 1 K. Since such a behavior contradicts conventional BCS theory, the authors assumed the presence of the second superconducting gap. Our results (see Fig. 7) are quite different. \lambda(T), evaluated from \muSR measurements, is practically temperature independent below 2 K in complete agreement with conventional single-gap theories of superconductivity. We argue that the most probable reason for the above-mentioned disagreement in the \lambda(T) dependence comes from the difference in the experimental techniques. The self-inductance technique used in Refs. [6, 6] provides information about the properties of the surface of the sample. It is likely that in this Li-containing compound the properties of the surface layer of the sample are different from those of the bulk.

To summarize, in the whole temperature range (from T_{c} down to 30 mK) the temperature dependence of \lambda is consistent with what is expected for a single-gap s-wave BCS superconductor. The value of the superconducting gap was found to be \Delta_{0}=1.31(3) meV, that corresponds to the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.0(1).

## IV Conclusions

Muon-spin rotation and magnetization studies were performed on the ternary boride superconductor Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (T_{c} = 7.3 K). The main results are (i) The absolute values of \lambda, \xi, \kappa, H_{c1}, and H_{c2} at zero temperature obtained from \muSR are \lambda(0)= 252(2) nm, \xi(0)=9.5 nm, \kappa(0)=27(1), \mu_{0}H_{c1}(0) =9.5(1) mT, and \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=3.66(8) T. (ii) The values of H_{c2}(0) evaluated from \muSR and magnetization measurements coincide within the experimental accuracy. (iii) Over the whole temperature range (from T_{c} down to 30 mK) the temperature dependence of \lambda is consistent with what is expected for a single-gap s-wave BCS superconductor. (iv) No influence of the applied magnetic field to \lambda(T) was observed. (v) At T=0, the magnetic field dependence of \sigma_{\rm sc} is in agreement with what is expected for a superconductor with an isotropic energy gap.

To conclude, all the above-mentioned features suggest that Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is a _BCS superconductor with an isotropic energy gap_.

###### Abstract

Measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda in the ternary boride superconductor Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (T_{c} =7.3 K) have been carried out by means of muon-spin rotation (\muSR). The absolute values of \lambda, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, and the first H_{c1} and second H_{c2} critical fields at T=0 obtained from \muSR were found to be \lambda(0) = 252(2) nm, \kappa(0) = 27(1), \mu_{0}H_{c1}(0) = 9.5(1) mT, and \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.66(8) T, respectively. The zero-temperature value of the superconducting gap \Delta_{0}=1.31(3) meV was found, corresponding to the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.0(1). At low temperatures \lambda(T) saturates and becomes constant below T= 0.2T_{c}, in agreement with what is expected for s-wave BCS superconductors. Our results suggest that Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is a s-wave BCS superconductor with only one isotropic energy gap.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the ternary boride superconductors Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B has attracted considerable interest in the study of these materials.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] It is believed now that superconductivity in both the above-mentioned compounds is most likely mediated by phonons. It stems from photoemission,[3] nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),[4] and specific heat experiments.[6] Moreover, the observation of a Hebel-Slichter peak in the ^{11}B spin-lattice relaxation rate in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B strongly supports singlet pairing.[4] However, experimental results concerning the structure of the superconducting energy gap are still controversal. On the one hand, NMR data of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (Ref. [4]) and specific heat data of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (Ref. [6]) can be well explained assuming conventional superconductivity. On the other hand, recent measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda suggest unconventional behavior of both compounds, namely, double-gap superconductivity in Li_{3}Pd_{2}B and nodes in the energy gap in Li_{3}Pt_{2}B.[5, 7] This contradiction is serious and shows that further experimental investigations of these compounds are needed.

In this paper, we report a systematic study of magnetic field penetration depth \lambda in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B by means of transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF-\muSR) (the detailed description of the TF-\muSR technique in connection with \lambda studies can be found, e.g., in Ref. [8]). Measurements were performed down to 30 mK in a series of fields ranging from 0.02 to 2.3 T. For all magnetic fields studied (0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2.3 T) no sign of a second superconducting gap was detected. All our results may be well explained by assuming conventional superconductivity with only _one isotropic_ energy gap. The absolute values of \lambda, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, and the first (H_{c1}) and second (H_{c2}) critical fields at T=0 obtained from \muSR were found to be \lambda(0) = 252(2) nm, \kappa(0) = 27(1), \mu_{0}H_{c1}(0) = 9.5(1) mT, and \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.66(8) T, respectively. The zero temperature value of the superconducting gap \Delta_{0} was found to be 1.31(3) meV that corresponds to the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.0(1).

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we describe the sample preparation procedure and the TF-\muSR technique in connection with \lambda(T) measurements. In Sec. III A we discuss the temperature dependence of the second critical field H_{c2}. In Sec. III B we present the calculation of the absolute value of \lambda and the magnetic field dependence of the second moment of the \muSR line. Section III.3 comprises studies of the temperature dependence of \lambda. The conclusions follow in Sec. IV.

## II Experimental Details

The Li_{2}Pd_{3}B polycrystalline sample was prepared by two-step arc melting.[1] First, a binary Pd_{3}B alloy was prepared by conventional arc melting from the mixture of Pd(99.9% ) and B(99.5% ). The alloying of Li was done in the second arc melting, in which a small piece of Pd_{3}B alloy was placed on a Li(>99 % ) plate. Once the Pd_{3}B alloy melted, the reaction with Li occurred and developed very fast, forming a small button specimen (around 300 mg). Since the loss of Li was inevitable, the Li concentration in the final sample was estimated from the weight change. The deviation of the Li concentration from the stoichiometric one was less than 1% for the specimens used in this experiment.

Field-cooled magnetization (M_{\rm FC}) measurements were performed with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in fields ranging from 0.5 mT to 4 T and temperatures between 1.75 and 10 K. The M_{\rm FC}(T) curve for \mu_{0}H=0.5 mT is shown in Fig. 1. The superconducting transition is rather broad indicating that the sample is not particularly uniform, i.e., the superconducting transition temperature may be evaluated only approximately. The middle point of the transition corresponds to T_{c}^{\rm(mp)}=7.1 K, while the linear extrapolation of the steepest part of the M(T) curve to M=0 results in T_{c}^{\rm(ext)}= 7.6 K (see Fig. 1).

TF-\muSR experiments were performed at the \piM3 beam line at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The Li_{2}Pd_{3}B sample was field cooled from above T_{c} down to 30 mK in fields of 2.3, 1, and 0.5 T, and down to \simeq 1.6 K in fields of 0.1 and 0.02 T. In the transverse-field geometry the local magnetic field distribution P(B) inside the superconducting sample in the mixed state, probed by means of the TF-\muSR technique, is determined by the values of the coherence length \xi and the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda. In extreme type-II superconductors (\lambda \gg \xi) the P(B) distribution is almost independent on \xi and the second moment of P(B) line becomes simply proportional to 1/\lambda^{4}.[9, 10]

The \muSR signal was recorded in the usual time-differential way by counting positrons from decaying muons as a function of time. The time dependence of the positron rate is given by the expression[11]

\[N(t)=N_{0}\frac{1}{\tau_{\mu}}e^{-t/\tau_{\mu}}[1+aP(t)]+bg\,,\] (1)

where N_{0} is the normalization constant, bg denotes the time-independent background, \tau_{\mu}=2.19703(4) x 10-6 s is the muon lifetime, a is the maximum decay asymmetry for the particular detector telescope (a \sim 0.18 in our case), and P(t) is the polarization of the muon ensemble

\[P(t)=\int\,P(B)\mathrm{cos}(\gamma_{\mu}Bt+\phi)dB\,.\] (2)

Here \gamma_{\mu}=2 \pi x 135.5342 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio and \phi is the angle between the initial muon polarization and the effective symmetry axis of a positron detector. P(t) can be linked to the internal field distribution P(B) by using the algorithm of Fourier transform.[11]

The P(t) and P(B) distributions inside the Li_{2}Pd_{3}B sample in the normal (T = 8.5 K) and in the mixed state (T = 2 K) after field cooling in a magnetic field of 0.1 T are shown in Fig. 2. The P(B) distributions were obtained from the measured P(t) by using the fast Fourier transform procedure based on the maximum entropy algorithm.[12] In the normal state, a symmetric line at the position of the external magnetic field with a broadening arising from the nuclear magnetic moments is seen. Below T_{c} the field distribution is broadened and asymmetric. In order to account for the asymmetric field distribution, \muSR time spectra obtained below T_{c} were fitted by two Gaussian lines[13, 14]

\[P(t)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2}A_{i}\,\exp(-\,\sigma_{i}^{2}t^{2}/2)\mathrm{cos}( \gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t+\phi)\,,\] (3)

where A_{i}, \sigma_{i}, and B_{i} are the asymmetry, the Gaussian relaxation rate, and the first moment of the i-th line, respectively. At T>T_{c}, the analysis is simplified to a single line with \sigma_{\mathrm{mm}}\sim 0.1 MHz arising from the nuclear moments of the sample. Equation (3) is equivalent to the field distribution[14]

\[P(B)=\gamma_{\mu}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}}{\sigma_{i}}\,\exp(-\,\frac{ \gamma_{\mu}^{2}(B-B_{i})^{2}}{2\sigma_{i}^{2}})\,.\] (4)

  \muSR time spectra. The corresponding P(B) lines are shown in Figs. 2(c). For this distribution the mean field and the second moment are [14]

\[\langle B\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\frac{A_{i}B_{i}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}\] (5)

and

\[\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\gamma_{\mu}^{2}}=\sum_{i=1}^{2} \frac{A_{i}}{A_{1}+A_{2}}\Bigg{[}\frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}}{\gamma_{\mu}^{2}}+[B_{ i}-\langle B\rangle]^{2}\Bigg{]}.\] (6)

The superconducting part of the square root of the second moment \sigma_{\rm sc} was then obtained by subtracting the contribution of nuclear moments \sigma_{\rm nm} measured at T>T_{c} as \sigma_{\rm sc}^{2} = \sigma^{2} = -\sigma_{\rm nm}^{2}. From the known value of \sigma_{\rm sc} the absolute value of \lambda can be evaluated using the following relation:

\[\sigma_{\rm sc}[\mu{\rm s}^{-1}] = 4.83\times 10^{4}(1-H/H_{c2})[1+1.21(1\] (7) \[-\sqrt{H/H_{c2}})^{3}]\lambda\text{-}^{2}[{\rm nm}],\]

which describes the field variation of \sigma_{\rm sc} for an ideal triangular vortex lattice. [10] Note, that according to Ref. [10], Eq. (7) does not hold for very low magnetic inductions.

## III III. Experimental results and discussion

### A. Temperature dependence of the upper critical field

The field-cooled magnetization M_{\rm FC}(T) curves for several magnetic fields H are shown in Fig. 3. For each particular field H the corresponding transition temperature T_{c}(H) was taken as an intersect of the linear extrapolation of the steepest part of the M_{\rm FC}(H) curve with M = 0 line. The resulting H_{c2}(T) dependence is presented in Fig. 4. It is seen that H_{c2}(T) data can be satisfactorily fitted with the model provided by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory. [15] The fit yields H_{c2}(0) = 3.58(10) T and T_{c} = 7.25 K. Note, that the value of the transition temperature obtained from the fit lies between T_{c}^{\rm(mp)} and T_{c}^{\rm(ext)}introduced in Fig. 1, i.e., it is in agreement with low-field magnetization measurements. In the following, the H_{c2}(T) curve presented in Fig. 4 is used to analyze the \muSR data (see Sec. III.3).

To summarize, the temperature dependence of the second critical field can be well described within the WHH theory. The absolute value of the second critical field at T = 0 was found to be 3.58(10) T in agreement with results of Badica _et al._[2]

### B. Magnetic field dependence of the second moment of \muSR line

In Fig. 5(a) the temperature dependences of \sigma_{\rm sc} for \mu_{0}H = 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2.3 T are shown. For \mu_{0}H = 0.5, 1, and 2.3 T, \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) was measured down to 30 mK. It is seen, that below 1.5 K \sigma_{\rm sc} is practically temperature independent [Fig. 5(b)]. Bearing in mind that the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\rm sc} saturates at low temperatures, the values of \sigma_{\rm sc}(T = 0) can be reliably evaluated for all magnetic fields. The results are plotted in Fig. 6 as a function of H. For \mu_{0}H=0.5, 1.0, and 2.3 T \sigma_{\rm sc}(0) was obtained from the zero slope linear fit of the T\leq 1.5 K data [see Fig. 5(b)] and for \mu_{0}H=0.02 and 0.1 T \sigma_{\rm sc}(0) was assumed to be equal to \sigma_{\rm sc} at the lowest measured temperature (T\approx 1.55 K). The solid line in Fig. 6 represents the result of the fit of Eq. (7) to the experimental data with H_{c2}(0)= 3.66(8) T and \lambda(0) = 252(2) nm. As it was already mentioned above, Eq. (7) does not hold for very low magnetic fields. For this reason the data point for \mu_{0}H= 0.02 T was excluded from the fit. It is seen (Fig. 6), that the theoretical curve perfectly matches all data points for \mu_{0}H\geq 0.1 T. The value of \sigma_{\rm sc} for \mu_{0}H=0.02 T lies slightly below the theoretical curve, as expected. It is important to emphasize that the value of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.66(8) T obtained from the fit of \sigma_{\rm sc}(0,H) data coincides within the error with \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.58(10) T, evaluated in the previous section from the directly measured H_{c2}(T). This good agreement between the values of H_{c2}, obtained from the two completely

  different experiments, demonstrates the validity of our analysis.

The above-presented experiments show unambiguously that l, evaluated from _m_SR measurements, is _magnetic field independent_, as one would expect in case of a conventional superconductor with isotropic energy gap.[16] On the other hand, in superconductors with nodes in the gap and isotropic double-gap superconductors like MgB_{2}, l, evaluated in the same way, increases with increasing magnetic field (see, e.g., Refs. [13], [16], and [17]). Thus, the fact, that the \sigma_{\rm sc}(0) versus H dependence is perfectly described by the field independent l (see Fig. 6), implies that Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is a _conventional single-gap_ superconductor.

The zero-temperature value of the superconducting coherence length \xi(0) may be estimated from H_{c2}(0) as \xi(0) =[\Phi_{0}/2\,\pi H_{c2}(0)]0.[5], which results in \xi(0) = 9.5(2) nm (\Phi_{0} is the magnetic flux quantum). Using the values of l(0) and \xi(0), one can evaluate the zero-temperature value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa(0) = l(0)/\xi(0) \approx 27(1). The value of the first critical field can be calculated by means of Eq. (4) from Ref. [10] as \mu_{0}H_{c1} = 9.5(1) mT. It is remarkable that all superconducting characteristics of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B could be obtained solely from _m_SR experiments.

To summarize, the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting part of the _m_SR depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm sc} is well described within the Ginzburg-Landau theory for anisotropic single-gap superconductors. The zero-temperature values of the first and second critical fields, the magnetic penetration depth, the coherence length, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter were found to be \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = 3.66(8) T, \mu_{0}H_{c1} = 9.5(1) mT, l(0) = 252(2) nm, \xi(0) = 9.5(2) nm, and \kappa = 27(1), respectively.

### Temperature dependence of l

Equation (7) implies that \sigma_{\rm sc} depends on l and the reduced magnetic field H/H_{c2}. It is also clear that \sigma_{\rm sc} vanishes for H \congH_{c2}(T). This means that in order to obtain the temperature dependence of l from the \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) curves, the temperature dependence of H/H_{c2} must be taken into account. In our calculations, the H_{c2}(T) curve provided by the solid line in Fig. 4 was used. Due to the known value of \kappa = 27(1), we are not limited by Eq. (7) but can directly apply the numerical calculations of Brandt.[10] In this case, the results collected in the lowest magnetic field (\mu_{0}H = 0.02 T) can also be used. The resulting temperature dependence of l is shown in Fig. 7. Remarkably, all l points, reconstructed from \sigma_{\rm sc} measured in various magnetic fields, collapse onto a single l(T) curve. It should be emphasized that in this reconstruction no adjustable parameter was used. The \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) dependences were obtained by means of _m_SR, while the H_{c2}(T) curve was measured in a completely different set of magnetization experiments (see Sec. III.1).

Considering the temperature dependence of l, one should note that it can be better described by the BCS theory for a moderate coupling with the zero-temperature energy gap 2\Delta_{0} = 4.0(1)k_{B}T_{c} [\Delta(0) = 1.31(3) meV] rather than for the weak coupling limit. This is in agreement with the value 2\Delta_{0} = 3.94k_{B}T_{c} obtained recently from specific-heat measurements.[6] The upward deviations of the experimental data points from the theoretical curve at higher temperatures (see Fig. 7) is expected for nonuniform samples (e.g., for the samples where the transition temperatures are distributed via a certain range \Delta T_{c}). At temperatures close to T_{c}\sim^{2} \sim (T_{c}-T). Assuming that the critical temperature varies throughout the sample from T_{c0} -\Delta T_{c} to T_{c0}, then the relative variation of l^{\sim}T <T_{c0} -\Delta T_{c} is proportional to [1 -\Delta T_{c}/(T_{c0}

  -T)]^{-1}, i.e., it increases with increasing temperature. The value of \sigma, resulting from \muSR experiments in the case of nonuniform samples, may be written as \sigma^{2}= 1/V_{0}\int\sigma_{\rm local}^{2}dV (\sigma_{\rm local} is the local value of \sigma in the unit volume dV and V_{0} is the sample volume). Taking into account that \sigma_{\rm local}\sim 1/\lambda_{\rm local}^{4} this averaging implies that the parts of the sample with the smallest values of \lambda (the highest values of T_{c}) provide the main contribution to \sigma_{\rm sc}. At lower temperatures, however, \lambda become more uniform throughout the sample and \sigma_{\rm sc} can be used for reliable calculations of \lambda(T).

Recently, Yuan _et al._ studied the magnetic field penetration depth in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B by means of self-inductance technique.[5, 6] It was obtained that a considerable increase of \lambda starts already at temperatures well below 1 K. Since such a behavior contradicts conventional BCS theory, the authors assumed the presence of the second superconducting gap. Our results (see Fig. 7) are quite different. \lambda(T), evaluated from \muSR measurements, is practically temperature independent below 2 K in complete agreement with conventional single-gap theories of superconductivity. We argue that the most probable reason for the above-mentioned disagreement in the \lambda(T) dependence comes from the difference in the experimental techniques. The self-inductance technique used in Refs. [6, 6] provides information about the properties of the surface of the sample. It is likely that in this Li-containing compound the properties of the surface layer of the sample are different from those of the bulk.

To summarize, in the whole temperature range (from T_{c} down to 30 mK) the temperature dependence of \lambda is consistent with what is expected for a single-gap s-wave BCS superconductor. The value of the superconducting gap was found to be \Delta_{0}=1.31(3) meV, that corresponds to the ratio 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.0(1).

## IV Conclusions

Muon-spin rotation and magnetization studies were performed on the ternary boride superconductor Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (T_{c} = 7.3 K). The main results are (i) The absolute values of \lambda, \xi, \kappa, H_{c1}, and H_{c2} at zero temperature obtained from \muSR are \lambda(0)= 252(2) nm, \xi(0)=9.5 nm, \kappa(0)=27(1), \mu_{0}H_{c1}(0) =9.5(1) mT, and \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=3.66(8) T. (ii) The values of H_{c2}(0) evaluated from \muSR and magnetization measurements coincide within the experimental accuracy. (iii) Over the whole temperature range (from T_{c} down to 30 mK) the temperature dependence of \lambda is consistent with what is expected for a single-gap s-wave BCS superconductor. (iv) No influence of the applied magnetic field to \lambda(T) was observed. (v) At T=0, the magnetic field dependence of \sigma_{\rm sc} is in agreement with what is expected for a superconductor with an isotropic energy gap.

To conclude, all the above-mentioned features suggest that Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is a _BCS superconductor with an isotropic energy gap_.
