###### Abstract

Magnetization, electrical-resistivity, specific-heat, and thermopower measurements were performed on single crystals of the filled skutterudite compound PrRu_{4}As_{12}. These measurements reveal a superconducting transition near 2.5 K that is quantified by: (1) magnetic susceptibility data which display an onset to a Meissner state at T_{c} = 2.5 K and complete diamagnetic shielding as T \rightarrow 2.0 K, (2) electrical-resistivity data which show a transition to a zero-resistance state at T_{c} \approx 2.5 K, and (3) specific-heat and thermopower data which display "jumps" at T_{c} \approx 2.5 K. Furthermore, the electronic contribution to the specific heat follows the BCS prediction for a superconductor. For temperatures above T_{c}, magnetization measurements indicate local moment behavior where \mu_{eff}=3.52 \mu_{\rm B}/Pr^{3+} ion. Analysis of the data for T > T_{c}, using a crystalline electric field model, suggests that PrRu_{4}As_{12} has a \Gamma_{1} ground state with a \Gamma_{4} first excited state at T_{\Gamma_{4}} = 95 K.

## I Introduction

The family of filled skutterudite compounds with the chemical formula MT_{4}X_{12}--where M is an alkali metal, alkaline earth, lanthanide, or actinide; T is Fe, Ru, or Os; and X is P, As, or Sb--display a wide variety of strongly correlated electron phenomena: e.g., superconductivity (both conventional and unconventional), magnetic and quadrupolar order, metal-insulator transitions, Kondo phenomena, heavy-fermion, and non-Fermi-liquid behavior.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] The Pr-based filled skutterudites provide a particularly large reservoir of interesting phenomena as a result of the interplay between several factors including: (1) hybridization between conduction electron and Pr localized f-electron states, (2) splitting of the Pr^{3+} ion Hund's rule ground-state multiplet by crystal-line electric fields (CEFs), and (3) complicated electronic band structures.

To date, much of the research on the Pr-based filled skutterudite compounds has focused on those that include Sb and P, in part because of technical difficulties in synthesizing single crystals of As-based filled skutterudites. These problems were recently overcome[6] and several members of the arsenide series have now been studied in single-crystal form. Presented here are the first measurements on single crystals of the compound PrRu_{4}As_{12}. We report results for magnetization M(T), specific heat C(T,H), electrical resistivity \rho(T), and thermopower S(T), all of which show that PrRu_{4}As_{12} displays conventional superconductivity below a critical temperature of T_{c} = 2.5 K. Analysis of CEF effects on M(T), C(T), and \rho(T) are used to determine the CEF splittings of the Pr^{3+} Hund's rule multiplet.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of PrRu_{4}As_{12} were grown from elements with purities >99.9% in a molten Cd:As flux at high temperatures and pressures using a technique detailed elsewhere.[6] Following the growth, PrRu_{4}As_{12} single crystals of an isometric form with dimensions up to \sim1.0 mm were collected and etched in HCl acid to remove any impurity phases from the surfaces. X-ray powder-diffraction measurements were performed using a Rigaku D/MAX B x-ray machine on a powder that was prepared by grinding several single crystals along with a high purity Si (8N) standard. These measurements did not reveal any significant impurity phases. The LaFe_{4}P_{12}-type filled skutterudite crystal structure was confirmed for PrRu_{4}As_{12} by x-ray diffraction on a crystal with a regular octahedral shape and dimensions of 0.21 \times 0.19 \times 0.18 mm^{3}. A total of 3136 reflections (366 unique, R_{\rm int}=0.0108) were recorded and the structure was resolved by the full matrix least-squares method using the shell x-97 program with a final discrepancy factor R1 =0.0324 [for I> 2\sigma(I), wR2=0.0715].[7, 8] The refinement revealed a lattice parameter of a = 8.508(2) A as well as full occupancy of the Pr sites.

Magnetization measurements were performed on single crystals of PrRu_{4}As_{12} using a Quantum Design (QD) magnetic properties measurement system for 1.7 \approx T \leq 300 K and H =1 and 50 mT. The specific heat for a collection of single crystals was measured for 600 mK \leq T < 40 K in a ^{3}He semadiabatic calorimeter using a standard heat pulse technique. Specific-heat measurements for 0 <H< 0.7 T and 0.37 < T < 7 K were performed for a different group of crystals with a total mass m = 13.4 mg in a QD physical properties measurement system using a standard heat pulse technique. The electrical resistivity was measured for 2 \leq T \leq 300 K for a single-crystal specimen in a ^{4}He cryostat using an ac resistance bridge and a standard four-wire technique. Measurements of the thermoelectric power for 0.5 < T < 350 K were performed on single crystals with lengths less than 1 mm using a method described by Wawryk and Henkie.[9]  

## III Results

### Magnetization

Magnetic susceptibility _kh_ = _M_/_H_ vs T measurements were performed for two single crystals of PrRu_{4}As_{12} in fields of 1 and 50 mT (oriented along the [100] crystallographic axis). As shown in Fig. 1, _kh_(_T_) for H = 50 mT can be fitted using a Curie-Weiss (CW) function _kh_(_T_) = _C_/_(_T_ - _th_CW) for temperatures between 115 and 300 K, yielding a Curie-Weiss temperature _th_CW = -6.21 K and an effective magnetic moment m_{f} = 3.52 _m_B (in close agreement with the Pr3+ free ion value of 3.58 _m_B). Below 100 K, the data deviate from CW behavior, indicating that CEF splitting becomes important at lower T. The left inset of Fig. 1 displays the low-temperature zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and FC volume magnetic susceptibilities for H = 1 mT, revealing the onset of superconductivity at T_{c} = 2.5 K. The ZFC measurement shows that _kh_(_T_) - 4p for T <= 2 K, indicating complete diamagnetic shielding. The FC data show 40% of the full Meissner state for T <= 2 K, which provides evidence for the formation of a bulk superconducting state.

### Specific heat

Displayed in Fig. 2 are specific heat _Cp_ divided by T vs T2 data for PrRu_{4}As_{12} between 0.6 and 7 K. A linear fit to the data in the region above the superconducting transition using the function _C__p_/_T_ = _g_/_bT_2 (for 3 <= 7 <= 5 K) yields the Sommerfeld coefficient g  70 mJ/mol K2 and b = 0.813 mJ/mol K4, from which the Debye temperature _th__D_ = 344 K is calculated. The superconducting transition is sharp, indicating good sample homogeneity. The jump in _C__p_/_T_ begins near 2.5 K and an equal area construction gives T_{c} = 2.44 K, in good agreement with the values found from _r_(_T_) and _kh_(_T_) data.

To investigate the nature of the superconducting state, fits of the electronic specific heat C_{c} = C_{p} - C_{i}, where C_{i} is the lattice portion of the specific heat determined from the linear fit described above, were made below T_{c}. For conventional superconductors, _C__c_s_(_T_) can be fit by an exponential BCS function, as is appropriate for an isotropic energy gap, while for unconventional superconductors, _C__c_s_(_T_) can often be described by a power law that is attributed to nodes in the energy gap. _C__c_s_(_T_) for PrRu_{4}As_{12} is described by an exponential function for T <= 0.6_T__c_, indicative of conventional superconductivity with an isotropic energy gap. A semilogarithmic plot of _C__c_s_/_gTc_ vs _T__c_/_T_ is shown in the right inset of Fig. 2 along with a fit to the equation,

\[\frac{C_{\mathit{cs}}}{\gamma T_{\mathit{c}}} = A\,\exp\frac{-BT_{\mathit{c}}}{T},\]

where A and B are fitting parameters. In the region 2.5 < _T__c_/_T_ < 4, the fit yields A = 8.4 and B = 1.44, in very close agreement with the predictions given by the BCS theory.

The jump in the specific heat near the superconducting transition, D_C_(_Tc_), provides information about the strength of the coupling. For PrRu_{4}As_{12}, D_C_(_Tc_)/_gTc_ = 1.53, which is close to the weak-coupling prediction [D_C_(_Tc_)/_gTc_ = 1.43] for a BCS superconductor. This value is quite different than the value of D_C_(_Tc_)/_gTc_ = 0.83 found by Namiki [10] for a polycrystalline specimen of PrRu_{4}As_{12}, suggesting that the single crystals are of higher quality.

Also shown in the left inset of Fig. 2 are the electronic portion of the entropy S_{e} and C_{e} vs T for PrRu_{4}As_{12}. As expected, the superconducting state entropy S_{e} is less than that of the normal-state entropy S_{e} since the superconducting state is more ordered. We also observe that C_{e} < S_{e} for T_{c} < T, in contrast to what is expected for a Fermi liquid. Although we cannot make any definitive statement, since measurement error could yield this difference, we note that

Left inset: zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and FC volume magnetic susceptibility 4 _π__X_ vs T data for PrRu_{4}As_{12} in a 1 mT field.

The solid line shows _γT_ + _βT_3 for 3 <= 7 <= 5 K where the Sommerfeld coefficient _γ_ × 70 mJ/mol K2 and _β_ = 0.813 mJ/mol K4, from which the Debye temperature _θ__D_ = 344 K is calculated. Left inset: low-temperature electronic contribution to the specific heat _C_s (closed circles) and entropy (open circles) S_{e} for PrRu_{4}As_{12}.

Right inset: electronic contribution to the specific heat in the superconducting state plotted as _C__cs_/_γT_c_ vs _T__c_/_T_ on a semilogarithmic plot. The solid line represents a fit to the data using Eq. (1) where A = 8.4 and B = 1.44.

 this situation could arise if C_{e} were to deviate from T-linear behavior for T<T_{c}.

Specific-heat measurements were performed for 0<H< 0.7 T and 0.37<T< 3 K [Fig. 3(a)]. From these data, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) [Fig. 3(b)] was determined using an equal entropy construction. Disregarding the small positive curvature near T_{c}, the initial slope (-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}} is 0.43 T/K and is 20% larger than that previously reported for polycrystalline samples.[10] The Pauli paramagnetic limiting field can be calculated from the expression H_{p_{0}}(0)=1.84T_{c} which gives a value near 4.4 T.[11, 12] By comparison, the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula for the orbital critical field in the clean limit yields H_{\rm WHH}(0)\simeq 0.71 T.[13] Thus, we conclude that the superconductivity is limited by orbital depairing mechanisms.

The superconducting coherence length can be determined from the expression (-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T} = \Phi/2T_{c}\pi\delta_{0}^{2}, yielding \xi_{0} = 178 A.[14] The Fermi velocity v_{F}\equiv 3.1\times10^{6} cm/s can then be calculated from the expression \xi_{0}=0.18hv_{F}/k_{B}T_{c}.[15] From v_{F}, the charge carrier effective mass m^{*} and the coefficient of the electronic specific heat \gamma can be estimated using a spherical Fermi-surface approximation where k_{F}= (3\pi^{2}/\Omega). Here, Z is the number of electrons per unit cell, and O is the unit-cell volume. From this expression, k_{F} is found to be 6.6\times10^{7} cm^{-1} and m^{*}=\hbark_{F}/v_{F} then gives m^{*}=24m_{e}. Finally, the electronic coefficient of the specific heat is given by \gamma=\pi^{2}(Z/\Omega)k_{B}^{2}m^{*}/\hbark_{F}^{2} and is found to be near 156 mJ/mol K^{2}. This value is somewhat enhanced in comparison to the value estimated from the normal-state specific heat and \Delta_C_(T_{c}) at T_{c}. It is interesting to note that similar results were obtained for the compound PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} where m^{*}\sim 24m_{e} and \gamma\sim 182 mJ/mol K^{2}, as calculated using the formalism described above.[16] In that case, the extrapolated normal state values for \gamma and \Delta_C_(T_{c}) are 75 mJ/mol K^{2} and 96 mJ/mol K^{2}, respectively.[17]

### C. Electrical resistivity

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) for a single crystal of PrRu_{4}As_{12} (closed circles). With decreasing T, \rho(T) decreases from the room-temperature value [\rho(300 K)=135 \mu\Omega cm] with negative curvature down to T\sim 50 K, after which \rho(T) exhibits positive curvature down to \rho_{0}=1.04 \mu\Omega cm just before it drops to zero below T_{c}\approx 2.5 K due to the superconducting transition (right inset of Fig. 4). From this value of \rho_{0}, we estimate the residual resistivity ratio RRR =\rho(300 K)/\rho_{0}\approx 94, which is comparable to the values found for PrOs_{4}As_{12} and PrFe_{4}As_{12} (RRR \approx 75)

To analyze the electrical transport behavior for PrRu_{4}As_{12} above T_{c}, we measured \rho(T) for a single-crystal specimen of LaRu_{4}As_{12} [\rho(300 K)=197 \mu\Omega cm], which is the homologous compound without f electrons (open circles in Fig. 4) to PrRu_{4}As_{12}. In order to describe \rho(T) for LaRu_{4}As_{12}, we considered the following scattering processes: (1) a T-independent term \rho_{0} which arises from impurities and/or defects that perturb the periodicity of the lattice potential and (2) electron-phonon scattering due to lattice vibrations, which can be described by the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) formula,

\[\rho_{\rm BG}(T)=A\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{R}}\right)^{n}\int_{0}^{\theta_{R}T} \frac{x^{n}dx}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})},\] (2)

where n= 5 (in the original treatment) and \theta_{R} is the Debye temperature. At low temperatures (T<\frac{1}{\theta}_{R}), this expression reduces to AT^{5} while at high temperatures (\frac{1}{\theta}_{R}<T) it becomes linear in T.[18] However, the BG expression where n = 5 is not generally valid and values of 2<n< 5 are commonly observed in intermetallic compounds with rare-earth elements.[19] For LaRu_{4}As_{12}, we find that for 10<T< 39 K, n= 3, as shown in the left inset of Fig. 4. The \rho(T) data in Fig. 4 are described well for 10<T< 150 K by the expression,

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+A\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{R}}\right)^{n}\int_{0}^{\theta_{R}T} \frac{x^{n}dx}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})},\] (3)

where n= 3, \rho_{0}=1.04 \mu\Omega cm, \theta_{R}= 272 K, and A = 207.3 \mu\Omega cm. From this value of \rho_{0}, we estimate RRR

  = 198, which is a factor of two larger than found for PrRu_{4}As_{12}. Finally, we find that the data can be fitted over the entire temperature range 10 < T < 300 K (solid line Fig. 4) by including a term _BT_[3], where B = -1.66 \times 10^{-6}\mu\Omega cm/K^{3}. This term is ascribed to _s_-_d_-type scattering, originally proposed by Mott, where s electrons are scattered by phonons into overlapping and incompletely filled bands. In this scenario, there is high probability that the s electrons will scatter into the dense empty states near the Fermi level associated with the d bands rather than back into the s band.[20]

Based on this treatment of _r_(_T_) for LaRu_{4}As_{12}, we are able to deduce the contribution to _r_(_T_) for PrRu_{4}As_{12} without f electrons in the following way. We first normalize _r_(_T_) for LaRu_{4}As_{12} such that it has the same slope at high T as _r_(_T_) for LaRu_{4}As_{12}. This is done by multiplying _r_(_T_) for LaRu_{4}As_{12} by 0.3/0.54 (open circles Fig. 5). Subsequently, we account for the difference between the Debye temperatures for LaRu_{4}As_{12} and PrRu_{4}As_{12} by multiplying the temperature scale by the ratio r0/_th_ = 344/272, where _th__D_ is taken from the fit to the specific heat for PrRu_{4}As_{12} (closed squares Fig. 5). If this modified curve is then subtracted from _r_(_T_) for PrRu_{4}As_{12} and r0= 1.04 \mu\Omega cm (for LaRu_{4}As_{12}) is replaced by r0= 1.44 \mu\Omega cm (for PrRu_{4}As_{12}), we then obtain the approximate CEF contribution to _r_(_T_) for PrRu_{4}As_{12} (open squares in Fig. 5).

### Thermoelectric power

Thermoelectric power _S_(_T_) data for PrRu_{4}As_{12} along the [100] crystallographic axis are shown as open circles in Fig. 6. The _S_(_T_) data for PrRu_{4}As_{12} deviate from a straight line _S_(_T_)=_a_T_ (_a_=0.12 \muV/K^{2}) above \sim80 K, as expected for diffusive thermoelectric power in a single band metal. However, the negative curvature at higher temperatures may indicate that PrRu_{4}As_{12} is a two-band metallic conductor,[21] as _S_(300 K) only reaches 18.0 \muV/K, while the resistivity is moderately low _r_(300 K) = 135 \mu\Omega cm. Additionally, a weak maximum is seen at T \sim 26 K followed by a minimum at T \sim 11 K. We note that a simple change in transition metal ion--Os for Ru--drastically changes _S_(_T_) above \approx100 K.

Figure 7 shows the temperature derivative of the thermoelectric power _dS_/_dT_ vs log T for PrRu_{4}As_{12} and PrOs_{4}As_{12}. This result emphasizes the sharpness of the change in curvature and accentuates the local maxima and minima of the curves. The abrupt slope changes are defined as T_{1}^{\prime} and T_{2}^{\prime} and mark characteristic temperatures for electron scattering. From the plot, a great deal of similarity between the _dS_/_dT_ vs log T behavior for PrRu_{4}As_{12} and PrOs_{4}As_{12} is evident, although the features of PrOs_{4}As_{12} are shifted to higher T. This similarity suggests comparable mechanisms for the thermoelectric power in the two compounds.

Behnia _et al._ argue that, in the zero-_T_ limit, the thermoelectric power should obey the relation

A clear difference is seen in the curvature of the data for the two compounds with convex and concave T dependence for PrOs_{4}As_{12} and PrRu_{4}As_{12}, respectively. For PrRu_{4}As_{12}, _S_(_T_) indicates possible two-band character. Left inset: the transition to the superconducting state at _T_c \approx 2.5 K and the superconducting region where _S_=0 \muV/K. Right inset: _S_/_T_ vs T showing a linear extrapolation to _T_=0.

  \[q=(S/T)(N_{\rm{A}}e^{i}/\gamma),\] (4)

where \gamma is the electronic specific-heat coefficient, N_{\rm{A}} is Avogadro's number, e is the electron charge, and the product N_{\rm{A}}e=9.65\times10^{4} C/mol is the Faraday number.[22] The dimensionless quantity q corresponds to the density of carriers per formula unit for the case of a free-electron gas with an energy-independent relaxation time. [Equation (4) was more rigorously derived by Zlatic _et al.[23]_ Shown in inset (b) of Fig. 6 is S(T)/T for PrRu_{4}As_{12} along with a linear fit of the data over the temperature range 3.6\,\leq\,T\,\leq\,10^{\rm} K. As can be seen, the data are nearly linear in this region, with a minimum in (S/T)_{min}=0.32 \,\muV/K^{2} before the onset of superconductivity. If the fit in the linear region is extrapolated to T=0 K, then (S/T)_{ext}=0.39 \,\muV/K^{2}. Using these values [(S/T)_{min} and (S/T)_{ext}] as well as \gamma=70 \,mJ/mol K^{2}, the dimensionless quantity q is calculated to be q\,=\,0.43 and q\,\approx\,0.53, respectively; both of which are consistent with the metallic conductivity of PrRu_{4}As_{12}.

### Crystalline electric field

In order to analyze the influence of the CEF on the Pr^{3+} ion energy levels in PrRu_{4}As_{12}, the \chi(T), \rho(T), and C(T) data were compared to various CEF level models. In the Steven's operator formalism, the CEF Hamiltonians for cubic O_{h} (Ref. [24]) and tetrahedral T_{h} symmetry[25] are

\[H_{O_{h}}=B_{4}(O_{4}^{0}+5O_{4}^{4})+B_{6}(O_{6}^{0}-21O_{6}^{4})\] (5)

and

\[H_{T_{h}}=H_{O_{h}}+B_{6}^{\prime}(O_{6}^{2}-O_{6}^{6}),\] (6)

respectively. Both groups have the same level degeneracies, although different labels and selection rules apply. While the extra term used for T_{h} symmetry has little effect on the actual CEF energies, it does mix the \Gamma_{4} and \Gamma_{5} wave functions from the O_{h} symmetry.[26] The difference this causes for the type of analysis to follow is small. Thus, although the true symmetry of the Pr^{3+} ion in PrRu_{4}As_{12} is T_{h}, the CEF analysis employed here will use the O_{h} symmetry and notation.

For cubic O_{h} symmetry, the inediol J=4 Hund's rule multiplet of Pr^{3+} is split into a \Gamma_{1} singlet, a \Gamma_{3} nonmagnetic doublet, and \Gamma_{4} and \Gamma_{5} triplets. Using the Lea, Leask, and Wolf (LLW) formalism,[24]x and W, where x is the ratio of the fourth- and sixth-order terms of the CEF Hamiltonian, and W sets the appropriate energy scale, serve as parameters to describe the energy levels.

Figure 8 shows the CEF fits to \chi(T) and \chi^{-1}(T) for T =2-300 K in the LLW formalism where x=0.95, W= =10.4 K, and the Lande g-factor g=0.8 with energy levels \Gamma_{1} (0 K), \Gamma_{4} (95 K), \Gamma_{3} (162 K), and \Gamma_{5} (502 K). Although the low-temperature behavior is not perfectly reproduced by the CEF fit (possibly because of a small concentration of paramagnetic impurities), these parameters were found to give the best representation of the data. For this reason, we conclude that this is the most likely energy-level arrangement.

A fit to the CEF contribution to the electrical resistivity \rho_{\rm{CEF}}(T), where \rho_{\rm{CEF}}(T) was acquired using the method described in Sec. III.3, is shown in Fig. 9. The fit was performed using only a magnetic exchange term for Pr^{3+} ions in a cubic environment[27] and by assuming that the CEF splitting scheme found from the fit to \chi(T) accurately described the data, i.e., x=0.95, W=-10.4 K, and the Lande g-factor g=0.8 with energy levels \Gamma_{1} (0 K), \Gamma_{4} (95 K), \Gamma_{3} (162 K), and \Gamma_{5} (502 K). Since the addition of an aspherical Coulomb scattering term did not improve the quality of the fits to the \rho_{\rm{CEF}}(T) data for PrRu_{4}As_{12}, this contribution was not included in the analysis.

In order to describe the total specific heat C_{p}(T), we found that, in addition to the electronic C_{e}=\,\gammaT, Debye C_{D}, and CEF C_{\rm{CEF}} components, it is necessary to include an Einstein mode lattice contribution which may arise as the result of the "rattling" motion of the Pr filler ions, as was found to be the case for several other filled skutterudites [e.g., Tl_{0.22}Co_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. [28]) and NdOs_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. [29])]. To obtain an estimate of the Einstein temperature, we first considered the expression

\[U=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{\rm{Pr}}k_{B}\theta_{E}}{\rm{coth}}\frac{\theta_{E}}{2T},\] (7)

where U=0.013 \AA^{2} is the room-temperature thermal displacement parameter determined from single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements,[6]m_{\rm{Pr}} is the atomic mass of Pr, and

  \theta_{E} is the Einstein temperature. From this analysis, we find that \theta_{E}= 89 K. Therefore, we assume that the Pr atoms partially act like Einstein oscillators with a mixing ratio r, and the lattice contribution to the specific heat can be expressed as C_{\mathit{Linf}}= C_{E}+C_{D} given by

\[C_{D} = (17 - _r_)9R\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{D}}\right)^{3}\int_{0}^{\theta_{D}/T}\frac{x^ {4}e^{x}}{(e^{x} - 1)^{2}}dx\]

and

\[C_{E}= _r_\left[\frac{3R(\theta_{E}/T)^{2}e^{\theta_{E}/T}}{(e^{\theta_{E}/T}-1)^{ 2}}\right],\]

where R is the universal gas constant, \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature, and \theta_{E} is the Einstein temperature. If we assume that \theta_{D}=344 K, g=70 mJ/mol K2, and the CEF contribution to _C_(_T_) can be calculated from the parameters described above for _kh_(_T_) and _r_(_T_), then it is possible to adjust r and \theta_{E} in order to optimize the fit to the data C_{\mathit{fri}}= C_{e}+ C_{D}+ C_{\mathrm{EE}} + C_{\mathrm{EE}} (Fig. 10). From this analysis, we find that r  0.45 and _thE_  55 K, in reasonably good agreement with the room-temperature value from single-crystal x-ray diffraction.

## IV Discussion

From these measurements, we conclude that PrRu_{4}As_{12} is a typical paramagnetic metal for which CEF effects play an important role. We find a high-_T_ Pr moment \mu_{\mathit{eff}}=3.52 \mu_{\mathrm{B}} from _kh_(_T_) measurements, which is close to the Pr3+ free ion value of 3.58 \mu_{\mathrm{B}}. The electrical resistivity _r_(_T_) decreases monotonically with decreasing T, consistent with a simple model that includes impurity/defect, lattice, and _s-d_ scattering processes. Below T, we find an excellent example of a BCS superconductor. For comparison purposes, we point out that recent measurements on polycrystalline PrRu_{4}As_{12} yielded similar superconducting transition temperature values, T_{\mathrm{c}}=2.33 K and T_{\mathrm{c}}=2.4 K. [10, 30] Perhaps not surprisingly, we do not see several features that Namiki _et al._ find including, (1) the strong upturn in _C_(_T_)/_T_ at low temperatures T  2 K and (2) the feature at 6 K. As Namiki _et al._ explain, they find an impurity phase in x-ray diffraction data and speculate that the 6 K feature is due to this phase: low-temperature upturn and the large differences found for \Delta C(T_{c})/\gamma T_{c} may also be due to an impurity phase.

In order to put PrRu_{4}As_{12} in context, it is informative to reflect on the richness of the behavior found in the Pr-based filled skutterudite compounds, as is most apparent in the first Pr-based heavy-fermion superconductor, PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. This compound enters an unconventional superconducting state at T_{\mathrm{c}}=1.85 K where heavy quasiparticles participate in the formation of Cooper pairs. [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] Upon suppression of the superconductivity with applied magnetic field, an antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) state is observed for 4.5\leq_H_  16 T and for T  1 K, suggesting that the superconductivity may be mediated by AFQ fluctuations. [42, 43] In contrast to PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, the remaining Pr-based filled skutterudites exhibit a variety of ground states including magnetic ordering (PrFe_{4}As_{12} and PrOs_{4}As_{12}), AFQ ordering (PrFe_{4}P_{12}), conventional superconductivity (PrRu_{4}As_{12} and PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}), heavy-fermion behavior (PrFe_{4}P_{12}, PrOs_{4}As_{12}, and PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}), metal-insulator transition (PrRu_{4}P_{12}), etc. [50]

Commensurate with the variety of phenomena in these compounds are a large number of CEF level arrangements, which vary unexpectedly from one compound to the next. While PrRu_{4}As_{12} has a \Gamma_{1} singlet ground state with a \Gamma_{4} first excited state, the other two members of the arsenide series appear to be the reverse of this and have a \Gamma_{5} triplet ground state with a \Gamma_{1} singlet first excited state. This \Gamma_{5}\rightarrow\Gamma_{1} to \Gamma_{1}\rightarrow\Gamma_{4} to \Gamma_{5}\rightarrow\Gamma_{1} evolution of the CEF ground states as Fe\rightarrowRu\rightarrowOs, is not universal in the Pr-based filled skutterudites. For the case of the antimonides, the \Gamma_{5}\rightarrow\Gamma_{1} of Pr_{1-x}Fe_{4}Sb_{12} becomes \Gamma_{1}\rightarrow\Gamma_{5} for both PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} and PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. On the other hand, the lattice parameter behaves as expected; PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} has the largest value of a of 9.3050 A and a decreases as the pnictogen or transition-metal ion decreases in size. It is also interesting to note that while PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} has a small CEF splitting \sim7 K between the ground state and first excited state, both PrRu_{4}As_{12} and PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} have much larger splittings, \sim95 K and \sim53 K, respectively. This result may support the notion that the unconventional superconductivity observed in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is related to the small splitting between the ground state and the first excited state. More generally, it seems likely that the ground state for each Pr-based filled skutterudites arises as the result of a delicate balance between several competing factors, among which CEF splitting plays a pivotal role.

## V Conclusion

From measurements of magnetization, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermopower, PrRu_{4}As_{12} is found to be a conventional superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature T_{\mathrm{c}}\approx 2.5 K. Magnetization measurements indicate that the 4f electrons of the Pr ion are localized with \mu_{\mathit{eff}}=3.52 \mu_{B} at high temperatures. From electrical-resistivity measurements, we find conventional metallic behavior above T_{c}. Specific-heat measurements reveal a mod

###### Abstract

Magnetization, electrical-resistivity, specific-heat, and thermopower measurements were performed on single crystals of the filled skutterudite compound PrRu_{4}As_{12}. These measurements reveal a superconducting transition near 2.5 K that is quantified by: (1) magnetic susceptibility data which display an onset to a Meissner state at T_{c} = 2.5 K and complete diamagnetic shielding as T \rightarrow 2.0 K, (2) electrical-resistivity data which show a transition to a zero-resistance state at T_{c} \approx 2.5 K, and (3) specific-heat and thermopower data which display "jumps" at T_{c} \approx 2.5 K. Furthermore, the electronic contribution to the specific heat follows the BCS prediction for a superconductor. For temperatures above T_{c}, magnetization measurements indicate local moment behavior where \mu_{eff}=3.52 \mu_{\rm B}/Pr^{3+} ion. Analysis of the data for T > T_{c}, using a crystalline electric field model, suggests that PrRu_{4}As_{12} has a \Gamma_{1} ground state with a \Gamma_{4} first excited state at T_{\Gamma_{4}} = 95 K.

## I Introduction

The family of filled skutterudite compounds with the chemical formula MT_{4}X_{12}--where M is an alkali metal, alkaline earth, lanthanide, or actinide; T is Fe, Ru, or Os; and X is P, As, or Sb--display a wide variety of strongly correlated electron phenomena: e.g., superconductivity (both conventional and unconventional), magnetic and quadrupolar order, metal-insulator transitions, Kondo phenomena, heavy-fermion, and non-Fermi-liquid behavior.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] The Pr-based filled skutterudites provide a particularly large reservoir of interesting phenomena as a result of the interplay between several factors including: (1) hybridization between conduction electron and Pr localized f-electron states, (2) splitting of the Pr^{3+} ion Hund's rule ground-state multiplet by crystal-line electric fields (CEFs), and (3) complicated electronic band structures.

To date, much of the research on the Pr-based filled skutterudite compounds has focused on those that include Sb and P, in part because of technical difficulties in synthesizing single crystals of As-based filled skutterudites. These problems were recently overcome[6] and several members of the arsenide series have now been studied in single-crystal form. Presented here are the first measurements on single crystals of the compound PrRu_{4}As_{12}. We report results for magnetization M(T), specific heat C(T,H), electrical resistivity \rho(T), and thermopower S(T), all of which show that PrRu_{4}As_{12} displays conventional superconductivity below a critical temperature of T_{c} = 2.5 K. Analysis of CEF effects on M(T), C(T), and \rho(T) are used to determine the CEF splittings of the Pr^{3+} Hund's rule multiplet.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of PrRu_{4}As_{12} were grown from elements with purities >99.9% in a molten Cd:As flux at high temperatures and pressures using a technique detailed elsewhere.[6] Following the growth, PrRu_{4}As_{12} single crystals of an isometric form with dimensions up to \sim1.0 mm were collected and etched in HCl acid to remove any impurity phases from the surfaces. X-ray powder-diffraction measurements were performed using a Rigaku D/MAX B x-ray machine on a powder that was prepared by grinding several single crystals along with a high purity Si (8N) standard. These measurements did not reveal any significant impurity phases. The LaFe_{4}P_{12}-type filled skutterudite crystal structure was confirmed for PrRu_{4}As_{12} by x-ray diffraction on a crystal with a regular octahedral shape and dimensions of 0.21 \times 0.19 \times 0.18 mm^{3}. A total of 3136 reflections (366 unique, R_{\rm int}=0.0108) were recorded and the structure was resolved by the full matrix least-squares method using the shell x-97 program with a final discrepancy factor R1 =0.0324 [for I> 2\sigma(I), wR2=0.0715].[7, 8] The refinement revealed a lattice parameter of a = 8.508(2) A as well as full occupancy of the Pr sites.

Magnetization measurements were performed on single crystals of PrRu_{4}As_{12} using a Quantum Design (QD) magnetic properties measurement system for 1.7 \approx T \leq 300 K and H =1 and 50 mT. The specific heat for a collection of single crystals was measured for 600 mK \leq T < 40 K in a ^{3}He semadiabatic calorimeter using a standard heat pulse technique. Specific-heat measurements for 0 <H< 0.7 T and 0.37 < T < 7 K were performed for a different group of crystals with a total mass m = 13.4 mg in a QD physical properties measurement system using a standard heat pulse technique. The electrical resistivity was measured for 2 \leq T \leq 300 K for a single-crystal specimen in a ^{4}He cryostat using an ac resistance bridge and a standard four-wire technique. Measurements of the thermoelectric power for 0.5 < T < 350 K were performed on single crystals with lengths less than 1 mm using a method described by Wawryk and Henkie.[9]  

## III Results

### Magnetization

Magnetic susceptibility _kh_ = _M_/_H_ vs T measurements were performed for two single crystals of PrRu_{4}As_{12} in fields of 1 and 50 mT (oriented along the [100] crystallographic axis). As shown in Fig. 1, _kh_(_T_) for H = 50 mT can be fitted using a Curie-Weiss (CW) function _kh_(_T_) = _C_/_(_T_ - _th_CW) for temperatures between 115 and 300 K, yielding a Curie-Weiss temperature _th_CW = -6.21 K and an effective magnetic moment m_{f} = 3.52 _m_B (in close agreement with the Pr3+ free ion value of 3.58 _m_B). Below 100 K, the data deviate from CW behavior, indicating that CEF splitting becomes important at lower T. The left inset of Fig. 1 displays the low-temperature zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and FC volume magnetic susceptibilities for H = 1 mT, revealing the onset of superconductivity at T_{c} = 2.5 K. The ZFC measurement shows that _kh_(_T_) - 4p for T <= 2 K, indicating complete diamagnetic shielding. The FC data show 40% of the full Meissner state for T <= 2 K, which provides evidence for the formation of a bulk superconducting state.

### Specific heat

Displayed in Fig. 2 are specific heat _Cp_ divided by T vs T2 data for PrRu_{4}As_{12} between 0.6 and 7 K. A linear fit to the data in the region above the superconducting transition using the function _C__p_/_T_ = _g_/_bT_2 (for 3 <= 7 <= 5 K) yields the Sommerfeld coefficient g  70 mJ/mol K2 and b = 0.813 mJ/mol K4, from which the Debye temperature _th__D_ = 344 K is calculated. The superconducting transition is sharp, indicating good sample homogeneity. The jump in _C__p_/_T_ begins near 2.5 K and an equal area construction gives T_{c} = 2.44 K, in good agreement with the values found from _r_(_T_) and _kh_(_T_) data.

To investigate the nature of the superconducting state, fits of the electronic specific heat C_{c} = C_{p} - C_{i}, where C_{i} is the lattice portion of the specific heat determined from the linear fit described above, were made below T_{c}. For conventional superconductors, _C__c_s_(_T_) can be fit by an exponential BCS function, as is appropriate for an isotropic energy gap, while for unconventional superconductors, _C__c_s_(_T_) can often be described by a power law that is attributed to nodes in the energy gap. _C__c_s_(_T_) for PrRu_{4}As_{12} is described by an exponential function for T <= 0.6_T__c_, indicative of conventional superconductivity with an isotropic energy gap. A semilogarithmic plot of _C__c_s_/_gTc_ vs _T__c_/_T_ is shown in the right inset of Fig. 2 along with a fit to the equation,

\[\frac{C_{\mathit{cs}}}{\gamma T_{\mathit{c}}} = A\,\exp\frac{-BT_{\mathit{c}}}{T},\]

where A and B are fitting parameters. In the region 2.5 < _T__c_/_T_ < 4, the fit yields A = 8.4 and B = 1.44, in very close agreement with the predictions given by the BCS theory.

The jump in the specific heat near the superconducting transition, D_C_(_Tc_), provides information about the strength of the coupling. For PrRu_{4}As_{12}, D_C_(_Tc_)/_gTc_ = 1.53, which is close to the weak-coupling prediction [D_C_(_Tc_)/_gTc_ = 1.43] for a BCS superconductor. This value is quite different than the value of D_C_(_Tc_)/_gTc_ = 0.83 found by Namiki [10] for a polycrystalline specimen of PrRu_{4}As_{12}, suggesting that the single crystals are of higher quality.

Also shown in the left inset of Fig. 2 are the electronic portion of the entropy S_{e} and C_{e} vs T for PrRu_{4}As_{12}. As expected, the superconducting state entropy S_{e} is less than that of the normal-state entropy S_{e} since the superconducting state is more ordered. We also observe that C_{e} < S_{e} for T_{c} < T, in contrast to what is expected for a Fermi liquid. Although we cannot make any definitive statement, since measurement error could yield this difference, we note that

Left inset: zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and FC volume magnetic susceptibility 4 _π__X_ vs T data for PrRu_{4}As_{12} in a 1 mT field. The ZFC data display perfect diamagnetism at T = 2 K where 4 _π__X_—−1 due to the diamagnetic shielding signal, while the FC data show the development of a Meissner state at T_{c}  2.5 K. Right inset: magnetic susceptibility _kh_ = _M_/_H_ vs T in a 50 mT field.

Figure 2: Specific heat divided by temperature _C__p_/_T_ vs T2 for PrRu_{4}As_{12} showing the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state at T_{c}  2.5 K. The solid line shows _γT_ + _βT_3 for 3 <= 7 <= 5 K where the Sommerfeld coefficient _γ_ × 70 mJ/mol K2 and _β_ = 0.813 mJ/mol K4, from which the Debye temperature _θ__D_ = 344 K is calculated. Left inset: low-temperature electronic contribution to the specific heat _C_s (closed circles) and entropy (open circles) S_{e} for PrRu_{4}As_{12}. The solid line is the normal-state entropy S_{e} extrapolated from T_{c}  2.5 K < T assuming Fermi-liquid behavior. Right inset: electronic contribution to the specific heat in the superconducting state plotted as _C__cs_/_γT_c_ vs _T__c_/_T_ on a semilogarithmic plot. The solid line represents a fit to the data using Eq. (1) where A = 8.4 and B = 1.44.

 this situation could arise if C_{e} were to deviate from T-linear behavior for T<T_{c}.

Specific-heat measurements were performed for 0<H< 0.7 T and 0.37<T< 3 K [Fig. 3(a)]. From these data, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) [Fig. 3(b)] was determined using an equal entropy construction. Disregarding the small positive curvature near T_{c}, the initial slope (-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}} is 0.43 T/K and is 20% larger than that previously reported for polycrystalline samples.[10] The Pauli paramagnetic limiting field can be calculated from the expression H_{p_{0}}(0)=1.84T_{c} which gives a value near 4.4 T.[11, 12] By comparison, the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula for the orbital critical field in the clean limit yields H_{\rm WHH}(0)\simeq 0.71 T.[13] Thus, we conclude that the superconductivity is limited by orbital depairing mechanisms.

The superconducting coherence length can be determined from the expression (-dH_{c2}/dT)_{T} = \Phi/2T_{c}\pi\delta_{0}^{2}, yielding \xi_{0} = 178 A.[14] The Fermi velocity v_{F}\equiv 3.1\times10^{6} cm/s can then be calculated from the expression \xi_{0}=0.18hv_{F}/k_{B}T_{c}.[15] From v_{F}, the charge carrier effective mass m^{*} and the coefficient of the electronic specific heat \gamma can be estimated using a spherical Fermi-surface approximation where k_{F}= (3\pi^{2}/\Omega). Here, Z is the number of electrons per unit cell, and O is the unit-cell volume. From this expression, k_{F} is found to be 6.6\times10^{7} cm^{-1} and m^{*}=\hbark_{F}/v_{F} then gives m^{*}=24m_{e}. Finally, the electronic coefficient of the specific heat is given by \gamma=\pi^{2}(Z/\Omega)k_{B}^{2}m^{*}/\hbark_{F}^{2} and is found to be near 156 mJ/mol K^{2}. This value is somewhat enhanced in comparison to the value estimated from the normal-state specific heat and \Delta_C_(T_{c}) at T_{c}. It is interesting to note that similar results were obtained for the compound PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} where m^{*}\sim 24m_{e} and \gamma\sim 182 mJ/mol K^{2}, as calculated using the formalism described above.[16] In that case, the extrapolated normal state values for \gamma and \Delta_C_(T_{c}) are 75 mJ/mol K^{2} and 96 mJ/mol K^{2}, respectively.[17]

### C. Electrical resistivity

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) for a single crystal of PrRu_{4}As_{12} (closed circles). With decreasing T, \rho(T) decreases from the room-temperature value [\rho(300 K)=135 \mu\Omega cm] with negative curvature down to T\sim 50 K, after which \rho(T) exhibits positive curvature down to \rho_{0}=1.04 \mu\Omega cm just before it drops to zero below T_{c}\approx 2.5 K due to the superconducting transition (right inset of Fig. 4). From this value of \rho_{0}, we estimate the residual resistivity ratio RRR =\rho(300 K)/\rho_{0}\approx 94, which is comparable to the values found for PrOs_{4}As_{12} and PrFe_{4}As_{12} (RRR \approx 75)

To analyze the electrical transport behavior for PrRu_{4}As_{12} above T_{c}, we measured \rho(T) for a single-crystal specimen of LaRu_{4}As_{12} [\rho(300 K)=197 \mu\Omega cm], which is the homologous compound without f electrons (open circles in Fig. 4) to PrRu_{4}As_{12}. In order to describe \rho(T) for LaRu_{4}As_{12}, we considered the following scattering processes: (1) a T-independent term \rho_{0} which arises from impurities and/or defects that perturb the periodicity of the lattice potential and (2) electron-phonon scattering due to lattice vibrations, which can be described by the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) formula,

\[\rho_{\rm BG}(T)=A\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{R}}\right)^{n}\int_{0}^{\theta_{R}T} \frac{x^{n}dx}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})},\] (2)

where n= 5 (in the original treatment) and \theta_{R} is the Debye temperature. At low temperatures (T<\frac{1}{\theta}_{R}), this expression reduces to AT^{5} while at high temperatures (\frac{1}{\theta}_{R}<T) it becomes linear in T.[18] However, the BG expression where n = 5 is not generally valid and values of 2<n< 5 are commonly observed in intermetallic compounds with rare-earth elements.[19] For LaRu_{4}As_{12}, we find that for 10<T< 39 K, n= 3, as shown in the left inset of Fig. 4. The \rho(T) data in Fig. 4 are described well for 10<T< 150 K by the expression,

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+A\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{R}}\right)^{n}\int_{0}^{\theta_{R}T} \frac{x^{n}dx}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})},\] (3)

where n= 3, \rho_{0}=1.04 \mu\Omega cm, \theta_{R}= 272 K, and A = 207.3 \mu\Omega cm. From this value of \rho_{0}, we estimate RRR

Solid line: fit to \rho(T) for LaRu_{4}As_{12} using Eq. (3) with an additional term BT^{3}. Left inset: \rho vs T^{3} for LaRu_{4}As_{12} showing that n=3 for the Bloch-Grüneisen formula. Right inset: \rho vs T for PrRu_{4}As_{12} showing that T_{c}\approx 2.5 K.

  = 198, which is a factor of two larger than found for PrRu_{4}As_{12}. Finally, we find that the data can be fitted over the entire temperature range 10 < T < 300 K (solid line Fig. 4) by including a term _BT_[3], where B = -1.66 \times 10^{-6}\mu\Omega cm/K^{3}. This term is ascribed to _s_-_d_-type scattering, originally proposed by Mott, where s electrons are scattered by phonons into overlapping and incompletely filled bands. In this scenario, there is high probability that the s electrons will scatter into the dense empty states near the Fermi level associated with the d bands rather than back into the s band.[20]

Based on this treatment of _r_(_T_) for LaRu_{4}As_{12}, we are able to deduce the contribution to _r_(_T_) for PrRu_{4}As_{12} without f electrons in the following way. We first normalize _r_(_T_) for LaRu_{4}As_{12} such that it has the same slope at high T as _r_(_T_) for LaRu_{4}As_{12}. This is done by multiplying _r_(_T_) for LaRu_{4}As_{12} by 0.3/0.54 (open circles Fig. 5). Subsequently, we account for the difference between the Debye temperatures for LaRu_{4}As_{12} and PrRu_{4}As_{12} by multiplying the temperature scale by the ratio r0/_th_ = 344/272, where _th__D_ is taken from the fit to the specific heat for PrRu_{4}As_{12} (closed squares Fig. 5). If this modified curve is then subtracted from _r_(_T_) for PrRu_{4}As_{12} and r0= 1.04 \mu\Omega cm (for LaRu_{4}As_{12}) is replaced by r0= 1.44 \mu\Omega cm (for PrRu_{4}As_{12}), we then obtain the approximate CEF contribution to _r_(_T_) for PrRu_{4}As_{12} (open squares in Fig. 5).

### Thermoelectric power

Thermoelectric power _S_(_T_) data for PrRu_{4}As_{12} along the [100] crystallographic axis are shown as open circles in Fig. 6. The _S_(_T_) data for PrRu_{4}As_{12} deviate from a straight line _S_(_T_)=_a_T_ (_a_=0.12 \muV/K^{2}) above \sim80 K, as expected for diffusive thermoelectric power in a single band metal. However, the negative curvature at higher temperatures may indicate that PrRu_{4}As_{12} is a two-band metallic conductor,[21] as _S_(300 K) only reaches 18.0 \muV/K, while the resistivity is moderately low _r_(300 K) = 135 \mu\Omega cm. Additionally, a weak maximum is seen at T \sim 26 K followed by a minimum at T \sim 11 K. We note that a simple change in transition metal ion--Os for Ru--drastically changes _S_(_T_) above \approx100 K.

Figure 7 shows the temperature derivative of the thermoelectric power _dS_/_dT_ vs log T for PrRu_{4}As_{12} and PrOs_{4}As_{12}. This result emphasizes the sharpness of the change in curvature and accentuates the local maxima and minima of the curves. The abrupt slope changes are defined as T_{1}^{\prime} and T_{2}^{\prime} and mark characteristic temperatures for electron scattering. From the plot, a great deal of similarity between the _dS_/_dT_ vs log T behavior for PrRu_{4}As_{12} and PrOs_{4}As_{12} is evident, although the features of PrOs_{4}As_{12} are shifted to higher T. This similarity suggests comparable mechanisms for the thermoelectric power in the two compounds.

Behnia _et al._ argue that, in the zero-_T_ limit, the thermoelectric power should obey the relation

A clear difference is seen in the curvature of the data for the two compounds with convex and concave T dependence for PrOs_{4}As_{12} and PrRu_{4}As_{12}, respectively. For PrRu_{4}As_{12}, _S_(_T_) indicates possible two-band character. Left inset: the transition to the superconducting state at _T_c \approx 2.5 K and the superconducting region where _S_=0 \muV/K. Right inset: _S_/_T_ vs T showing a linear extrapolation to _T_=0.

  \[q=(S/T)(N_{\rm{A}}e^{i}/\gamma),\] (4)

where \gamma is the electronic specific-heat coefficient, N_{\rm{A}} is Avogadro's number, e is the electron charge, and the product N_{\rm{A}}e=9.65\times10^{4} C/mol is the Faraday number.[22] The dimensionless quantity q corresponds to the density of carriers per formula unit for the case of a free-electron gas with an energy-independent relaxation time. [Equation (4) was more rigorously derived by Zlatic _et al.[23]_ Shown in inset (b) of Fig. 6 is S(T)/T for PrRu_{4}As_{12} along with a linear fit of the data over the temperature range 3.6\,\leq\,T\,\leq\,10^{\rm} K. As can be seen, the data are nearly linear in this region, with a minimum in (S/T)_{min}=0.32 \,\muV/K^{2} before the onset of superconductivity. If the fit in the linear region is extrapolated to T=0 K, then (S/T)_{ext}=0.39 \,\muV/K^{2}. Using these values [(S/T)_{min} and (S/T)_{ext}] as well as \gamma=70 \,mJ/mol K^{2}, the dimensionless quantity q is calculated to be q\,=\,0.43 and q\,\approx\,0.53, respectively; both of which are consistent with the metallic conductivity of PrRu_{4}As_{12}.

### Crystalline electric field

In order to analyze the influence of the CEF on the Pr^{3+} ion energy levels in PrRu_{4}As_{12}, the \chi(T), \rho(T), and C(T) data were compared to various CEF level models. In the Steven's operator formalism, the CEF Hamiltonians for cubic O_{h} (Ref. [24]) and tetrahedral T_{h} symmetry[25] are

\[H_{O_{h}}=B_{4}(O_{4}^{0}+5O_{4}^{4})+B_{6}(O_{6}^{0}-21O_{6}^{4})\] (5)

and

\[H_{T_{h}}=H_{O_{h}}+B_{6}^{\prime}(O_{6}^{2}-O_{6}^{6}),\] (6)

respectively. Both groups have the same level degeneracies, although different labels and selection rules apply. While the extra term used for T_{h} symmetry has little effect on the actual CEF energies, it does mix the \Gamma_{4} and \Gamma_{5} wave functions from the O_{h} symmetry.[26] The difference this causes for the type of analysis to follow is small. Thus, although the true symmetry of the Pr^{3+} ion in PrRu_{4}As_{12} is T_{h}, the CEF analysis employed here will use the O_{h} symmetry and notation.

For cubic O_{h} symmetry, the inediol J=4 Hund's rule multiplet of Pr^{3+} is split into a \Gamma_{1} singlet, a \Gamma_{3} nonmagnetic doublet, and \Gamma_{4} and \Gamma_{5} triplets. Using the Lea, Leask, and Wolf (LLW) formalism,[24]x and W, where x is the ratio of the fourth- and sixth-order terms of the CEF Hamiltonian, and W sets the appropriate energy scale, serve as parameters to describe the energy levels.

Figure 8 shows the CEF fits to \chi(T) and \chi^{-1}(T) for T =2-300 K in the LLW formalism where x=0.95, W= =10.4 K, and the Lande g-factor g=0.8 with energy levels \Gamma_{1} (0 K), \Gamma_{4} (95 K), \Gamma_{3} (162 K), and \Gamma_{5} (502 K). Although the low-temperature behavior is not perfectly reproduced by the CEF fit (possibly because of a small concentration of paramagnetic impurities), these parameters were found to give the best representation of the data. For this reason, we conclude that this is the most likely energy-level arrangement.

A fit to the CEF contribution to the electrical resistivity \rho_{\rm{CEF}}(T), where \rho_{\rm{CEF}}(T) was acquired using the method described in Sec. III.3, is shown in Fig. 9. The fit was performed using only a magnetic exchange term for Pr^{3+} ions in a cubic environment[27] and by assuming that the CEF splitting scheme found from the fit to \chi(T) accurately described the data, i.e., x=0.95, W=-10.4 K, and the Lande g-factor g=0.8 with energy levels \Gamma_{1} (0 K), \Gamma_{4} (95 K), \Gamma_{3} (162 K), and \Gamma_{5} (502 K). Since the addition of an aspherical Coulomb scattering term did not improve the quality of the fits to the \rho_{\rm{CEF}}(T) data for PrRu_{4}As_{12}, this contribution was not included in the analysis.

In order to describe the total specific heat C_{p}(T), we found that, in addition to the electronic C_{e}=\,\gammaT, Debye C_{D}, and CEF C_{\rm{CEF}} components, it is necessary to include an Einstein mode lattice contribution which may arise as the result of the "rattling" motion of the Pr filler ions, as was found to be the case for several other filled skutterudites [e.g., Tl_{0.22}Co_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. [28]) and NdOs_{4}Sb_{12} (Ref. [29])]. To obtain an estimate of the Einstein temperature, we first considered the expression

\[U=\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m_{\rm{Pr}}k_{B}\theta_{E}}{\rm{coth}}\frac{\theta_{E}}{2T},\] (7)

where U=0.013 \AA^{2} is the room-temperature thermal displacement parameter determined from single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements,[6]m_{\rm{Pr}} is the atomic mass of Pr, and

  \theta_{E} is the Einstein temperature. From this analysis, we find that \theta_{E}= 89 K. Therefore, we assume that the Pr atoms partially act like Einstein oscillators with a mixing ratio r, and the lattice contribution to the specific heat can be expressed as C_{\mathit{Linf}}= C_{E}+C_{D} given by

\[C_{D} = (17 - _r_)9R\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{D}}\right)^{3}\int_{0}^{\theta_{D}/T}\frac{x^ {4}e^{x}}{(e^{x} - 1)^{2}}dx\]

and

\[C_{E}= _r_\left[\frac{3R(\theta_{E}/T)^{2}e^{\theta_{E}/T}}{(e^{\theta_{E}/T}-1)^{ 2}}\right],\]

where R is the universal gas constant, \theta_{D} is the Debye temperature, and \theta_{E} is the Einstein temperature. If we assume that \theta_{D}=344 K, g=70 mJ/mol K2, and the CEF contribution to _C_(_T_) can be calculated from the parameters described above for _kh_(_T_) and _r_(_T_), then it is possible to adjust r and \theta_{E} in order to optimize the fit to the data C_{\mathit{fri}}= C_{e}+ C_{D}+ C_{\mathrm{EE}} + C_{\mathrm{EE}} (Fig. 10). From this analysis, we find that r  0.45 and _thE_  55 K, in reasonably good agreement with the room-temperature value from single-crystal x-ray diffraction.

## IV Discussion

From these measurements, we conclude that PrRu_{4}As_{12} is a typical paramagnetic metal for which CEF effects play an important role. We find a high-_T_ Pr moment \mu_{\mathit{eff}}=3.52 \mu_{\mathrm{B}} from _kh_(_T_) measurements, which is close to the Pr3+ free ion value of 3.58 \mu_{\mathrm{B}}. The electrical resistivity _r_(_T_) decreases monotonically with decreasing T, consistent with a simple model that includes impurity/defect, lattice, and _s-d_ scattering processes. Below T, we find an excellent example of a BCS superconductor. For comparison purposes, we point out that recent measurements on polycrystalline PrRu_{4}As_{12} yielded similar superconducting transition temperature values, T_{\mathrm{c}}=2.33 K and T_{\mathrm{c}}=2.4 K. [10, 30] Perhaps not surprisingly, we do not see several features that Namiki _et al._ find including, (1) the strong upturn in _C_(_T_)/_T_ at low temperatures T  2 K and (2) the feature at 6 K. As Namiki _et al._ explain, they find an impurity phase in x-ray diffraction data and speculate that the 6 K feature is due to this phase: low-temperature upturn and the large differences found for \Delta C(T_{c})/\gamma T_{c} may also be due to an impurity phase.

In order to put PrRu_{4}As_{12} in context, it is informative to reflect on the richness of the behavior found in the Pr-based filled skutterudite compounds, as is most apparent in the first Pr-based heavy-fermion superconductor, PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. This compound enters an unconventional superconducting state at T_{\mathrm{c}}=1.85 K where heavy quasiparticles participate in the formation of Cooper pairs. [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41] Upon suppression of the superconductivity with applied magnetic field, an antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) state is observed for 4.5\leq_H_  16 T and for T  1 K, suggesting that the superconductivity may be mediated by AFQ fluctuations. [42, 43] In contrast to PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}, the remaining Pr-based filled skutterudites exhibit a variety of ground states including magnetic ordering (PrFe_{4}As_{12} and PrOs_{4}As_{12}), AFQ ordering (PrFe_{4}P_{12}), conventional superconductivity (PrRu_{4}As_{12} and PrRu_{4}Sb_{12}), heavy-fermion behavior (PrFe_{4}P_{12}, PrOs_{4}As_{12}, and PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}), metal-insulator transition (PrRu_{4}P_{12}), etc. [50]

Commensurate with the variety of phenomena in these compounds are a large number of CEF level arrangements, which vary unexpectedly from one compound to the next. While PrRu_{4}As_{12} has a \Gamma_{1} singlet ground state with a \Gamma_{4} first excited state, the other two members of the arsenide series appear to be the reverse of this and have a \Gamma_{5} triplet ground state with a \Gamma_{1} singlet first excited state. This \Gamma_{5}\rightarrow\Gamma_{1} to \Gamma_{1}\rightarrow\Gamma_{4} to \Gamma_{5}\rightarrow\Gamma_{1} evolution of the CEF ground states as Fe\rightarrowRu\rightarrowOs, is not universal in the Pr-based filled skutterudites. For the case of the antimonides, the \Gamma_{5}\rightarrow\Gamma_{1} of Pr_{1-x}Fe_{4}Sb_{12} becomes \Gamma_{1}\rightarrow\Gamma_{5} for both PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} and PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}. On the other hand, the lattice parameter behaves as expected; PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} has the largest value of a of 9.3050 A and a decreases as the pnictogen or transition-metal ion decreases in size. It is also interesting to note that while PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} has a small CEF splitting \sim7 K between the ground state and first excited state, both PrRu_{4}As_{12} and PrRu_{4}Sb_{12} have much larger splittings, \sim95 K and \sim53 K, respectively. This result may support the notion that the unconventional superconductivity observed in PrOs_{4}Sb_{12} is related to the small splitting between the ground state and the first excited state. More generally, it seems likely that the ground state for each Pr-based filled skutterudites arises as the result of a delicate balance between several competing factors, among which CEF splitting plays a pivotal role.

## V Conclusion

From measurements of magnetization, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermopower, PrRu_{4}As_{12} is found to be a conventional superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature T_{\mathrm{c}}\approx 2.5 K. Magnetization measurements indicate that the 4f electrons of the Pr ion are localized with \mu_{\mathit{eff}}=3.52 \mu_{B} at high temperatures. From electrical-resistivity measurements, we find conventional metallic behavior above T_{c}. Specific-heat measurements reveal a mod
