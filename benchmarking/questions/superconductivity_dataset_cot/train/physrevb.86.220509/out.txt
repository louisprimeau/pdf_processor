###### Abstract

We have carried out a pressure study of the unconventional superconductor FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} up to 1.5 GPa by neutron scattering, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The neutron spin resonance energy and the superconducting transition temperature have been extracted as a function of applied pressure in samples obtained from the same crystal. Both increase with pressure up to a maximum at \approx1.3 GPa, directly demonstrating a correlation between these two fundamental parameters of unconventional superconductivity. A comparison between the quantitative evolution of T_{c} and the resonance energy as a function of applied pressure is also discussed. These measurements serve to demonstrate the feasibility of using pressure dependent inelastic neutron scattering to explore the relationship between the resonance energy and T_{c} in unconventional superconductors.

Unconventional superconductors such as cuprates, heavy-fermion compounds, iron pnictides, and chalcogenides all share some notable features. Perhaps the most salient is the presence of static or dynamic magnetism throughout the superconducting region of the phase diagram.[1, 2] A hallmark of this is a collective spin excitation that appears as a peak in the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility \chi^{\prime\prime}({\bf Q},\omega).[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] often called the spin resonance. This resonance is localized in both wave vector and energy transfer, and appears below the superconducting transition temperature. Although still open to interpretation,[13] a commonly held view is that this signal originates from a sign change of the superconducting order parameter on different parts of the Fermi surface.[14] This implies an unconventional mechanism with a repulsive interaction in momentum space, as opposed to the attractive interaction in BCS theory. Within this picture, the existence of the resonance is definitive evidence of unconventional superconductivity.[15] The observation of this signal in iron superconductors[9, 10, 11, 12, 16] provided further stimulus to explore the relationship between the resonance energy \omega_{r} and other characteristic energy scales such as the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} or the superconducting gap \Delta.[17, 18, 19, 1, 17]

Recent studies show that there is ambiguity in interpreting the relationship between T_{c} and \omega_{r},[18, 19] in large part due to the difficulty in separating the intrinsic and extrinsic effects of chemical doping, such as disorder, inhomogeneity, and the influence of static magnetic order. Consequently, a clean tuning parameter such as pressure has the potential to avoid these complications and yield further insight into the relationship of the resonance and unconventional superconductivity. Unfortunately, pressure dependent inelastic neutron scattering measurements are notoriously difficult and to date we are unaware of any reported studies of the spin resonance as a function of applied pressure. Thus the work presented here provides a demonstration of an experimental approach to explore the relationship between the spin excitation spectrum and unconventional superconductivity.

The FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} family is a good candidate for such studies, as large single crystals can be grown and T_{c} shows a substantial sensitivity to applied pressure.[20, 21] In particular, for compositions close to x\approx 0.43, the samples do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and T_{c} increases with pressure, reaching a maximum at \approx2 GPa,[22] a pressure amenable to a number of experimental techniques. Here, we present inelastic and elastic neutron scattering, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements of FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} (T_{c}\approx 12 K) up to 1.5 GPa. T_{c} and \omega_{r} show a qualitatively similar behavior, although \omega_{r} does not increase as much as T_{c} with increasing pressure, suggesting the lack of proportionality between these two energies.

The FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} crystal studied here was grown using a modified Bridgman technique.[23] The stoichiometry was determined by energy dispersive x-ray analysis, resulting in 1.02\pm 0.02 for Fe, 0.6\pm 0.02 for Te, and 0.4\pm 0.02 for Se. All the high pressure measurements were performed on samples from the same crystal growth (the same large single crystal). The inelastic neutron scattering experiments under pressure were performed on the HB-3 triple axis spectrometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) with collimations of 48'-60'-80'-120'. A McWhan piston-cylinder pressure cell[24] was used with 3M FC-75 fluorant as the pressure medium. A 0.5 g crystal was encapsulated in the inner BeCu neutron pressure cell (9\times h=5 mm \times 10 mm) with the [1\bar{1}0] direction vertical. Room temperature neutron powder diffraction was performed using the SNAP diffractometer at the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL. NaCl powder was ground into a 0.8 g FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} sample to use as a pressure calibration standard. The sample was loaded into a Paris-Edinburgh press fitted with single toroid cubic boron nitride anvils, with the incident beam through the TiZr null scattering alloy gasket. Pressure was determined by application of the isothermal NaCl equation of state determined by Decker[25] to the refined lattice parameters obtained at each measured pressure from LeBail fits using the Gas software suite.[26] High pressure resistivity measurements on a single crystal were performed in an easyLab Mcell 30. The electrical contacts were made using DuPont 4929N silver paste. The pressure was determined during the pressurization  at room temperature with calibrated manganin wire and was also calculated from the applied load. Fluorinert (FC-75) was used as the pressure medium. The dc magnetization was measured on a single crystal by a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS) in a BeCu piston cylinder cell using Daphne7373 as the pressure medium. The pressure was calibrated using the superconducting transition of Sn.

According to the different calibration tests for the McWhan pressure cell [24] (by measuring the resistance of a manganin wire under pressure), the chosen external forces applied on the pressure cell should result in room temperature pressures of \approx0, 1, and 1.5 GPa [Fig. 1(b)]. The lattice parameters of the large single crystal of FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} used for the inelastic measurements were extracted from _th-2p_ scans through the (110) and (001) Bragg reflections [see Figs. 1(a) and 1(c)] at room temperature on the HB-3 spectrometer for the three different chosen pressure points (applied forces of, respectively, 1, 7, and 10 tons). The relative decrease of these lattice parameters are compared to the absolute values of these same lattice parameters obtained from neutron powder diffraction using the SNAP diffractometer. For this purpose, the first pressure point, ambient pressure/1 ton, was considered as a common reference and the HB-3 lattice parameters were normalized to the SNAP ones. The measured relative changes (from HB-3) were then compared to the lattice parameters extracted from the SNAP data [see Fig. 1(a)]. While the lattice parameter a shows higher values than expected from neutron powder diffraction for these pressures, the lattice parameter c shows slightly lower values, which suggests that the actual pressures at room temperature on the single crystal are close to the expected ones. One of the first visible effects of applied pressure, besides the reduction of the lattice parameters, is the broadening of the crystal mosaic. The rocking curves show a significant increase in their width [see Fig. 1(d) and the inset]. A Lorentzian-squared function provides a better description of the rocking curves than a classical Gaussian function.

In the FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} family, the neutron spin resonance has been shown to be two dimensional, centered at a **Q** of (1/2 1/2 L), where L indicates the irrelevant direction. [11] Above T_{c}, the spin excitations in FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} originate from an incommensurate wave vector near (1/2 1/2 L). [27] Below T_{c} there is a suppression of low energy spectral weight transferred to higher energy, resulting in the appearance of a resonance peak at \omega_{s}\approx 6.5 meV. Constant-Q scans at (1/2 1/2 L) were measured on the FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} crystal at 0, 1, and 1.5 GPa. The same superconductivity induced redistribution of spectral weight can be seen in the constant-Q scans under applied pressure, as seen in Fig. 2(b) for 1 GPa and Fig. 2(c) for

  1.5 GPa. In each case there is a clear additional signal in the inelastic spectrum corresponding to the spin resonance. While the background introduced by the pressure cell is substantial, it is not insurmountable and is indicated in Fig. 2(c). This definitively shows the viability of such an experiment and that the resonance can be experimentally explored as a function of applied pressure.

The resonance signal is obtained by subtracting the data collected above T_{c} from the data collected below T_{c}. This procedure results in a positive difference centered at the resonance energy \omega_{r} and an associated negative difference at lower energy corresponding to the opening of a gap in the spin excitation spectrum. Figure 2(a) displays this signal measured on a large single crystal of the same concentration outside of the pressure cell, indicating the expected resonance at \omega_{r}=6.6 meV. For comparison, Fig. 2(d) shows the results of similar measurements on the 0.5 g sample (of the same concentration but different growth) within the pressure apparatus, confirming the presence of the resonance at the same energy. The effect of applied pressure on the resonance is illustrated by Figs. 2(e) and 2(f) (1 and 1.5 GPa, respectively). First, \omega_{r} is shifted to a higher energy at 1 GPa (\omega_{r}=7.5 meV), but does not increase further at higher pressure. Second, the spectral weight enhancement below T_{c} follows the same qualitative behavior as \omega_{r} with a clear increase at 1 GPa and does not increase further at 1.5 GPa.

The large thermal mass of the pressure cell combined with long counting times prohibited an accurate determination of T_{c} from the onset of the resonance. Therefore the pressure dependence of T_{c} was determined from resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystal samples from the same growth as the crystal used for the inelastic neutron scattering measurements (see Fig. 3). Although different methods are commonly used to extract T_{c} from resistivity data, for completeness we adopt two metrics: (1) the onset of the drop in resistivity due to the appearance of superconductivity (T_{c} onset) and (2) the temperature at which the resistivity achieves the minimum value (T_{c} min).

The magnetic susceptibility data show broad transitions [see Fig. 3(a)], as previously observed for lower concentrations of Se (x\leqslant 0.4). In those cases, T_{c} is usually defined as the temperature where \chi_{\text{mag}} starts to decrease.[28] Although the broadness of the transition potentially indicates a distribution of T_{c}'s, the energy of the resonance from the neutron scattering data is well defined, suggesting a unique bulk behavior.[29] For the following discussion, we will use the definition T_{c}(\chi_{\text{mag}}) as described above. Although we believe our neutron scattering data is consistent with a narrow distribution of transition temperatures, we note that a hypothetical distribution of T_{c}'s in our sample, together with a sharp resonance signal, can only be understood if the resonance energy and T_{c} are effectively decoupled.[29]

Here, as shown in Fig. 4(a), despite a constant offset in absolute value, T_{c} obtained from all three methods shows similar qualitative behavior, supporting the reliability of our definitions. At ambient pressure, previous measurements for this concentration suggest a T_{c} of about 14 K as extracted from the onset of resistivity. Our value of 13.6\pm 0.4 K is slightly less than this value. Such discrepancies are not uncommon, and this is precisely why we use pressure to overcome this problem by measuring the relative change of T_{c} in one sample rather than absolute values. Here, T_{c} increases with pressure by \approx50% at \approx1.3 GPa, and then remains constant or decreases slightly at higher pressures. Consistently, similar qualitative behavior was observed in other members of the FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} family.[20, 21, 22]

The lowest value of \chi_{\text{mag}}, at the lowest temperature (5 K), is a manifestation of the screening effect in the sample. \chi_{5\text{ K}} strongly decreases with applied pressure, reaching a plateau above \approx1 GPa [see Fig. 3(a), left]. This increased screening

(b) T_{c} dependence of the \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} ratio of FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.4} for all pressures (squares for 0 GPa, circles for 1 GPa, and triangles for 1.5 GPa), and all definitions of the transition temperature. The horizontal dotted lines correspond to the value of \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} at 0 GPa for all three definitions of T_{c}. The horizontal red line corresponds to \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.6, as previously observed for iron superconductors (Refs. [17] and [18]).

  effect could indicate an enhancement of the superconducting volume fraction with pressure. As the strength of the resonance signal scales with superconducting volume fraction, we would expect a change in volume fraction would result in a change in inelastic neutron scattering intensity, as observed experimentally [see Figs. 2(d)-2(f)]. Whether the intensity increase is due to a changing volume fraction or is caused by a direct link between T_{c} and the resonance spectral weight remains unclear.

To provide further insight into the implications of our measurements we make the assumption that the T_{c}'s which have been determined from bulk measurements are representative of the behavior of the large single crystal. Under this assumption \omega_{r}(P) and T_{c}(P) can be relevantly compared. Figure 4(a) displays such a comparison, where \omega_{r} is expressed in units of kelvin and scaled by a constant to coincide with the lowest estimate of T_{c}(P) at ambient pressure. Despite a qualitative similarity in the behavior of \omega_{r}(P) and T_{c}(P), the resonance energy does not increase nearly as rapidly as T_{c}. To further clarify this point, Fig. 4(b) shows the ratio \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} as a function of T_{c}. Both Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) suggest that \omega_{r} is not proportional to T_{c}. This fact is independent of the definition we choose for T_{c}. These measurements show the feasibility of inelastic neutron scattering as a function of applied pressure for such studies, and future measurements will be of high interest to compare these results with other unconventional superconductors.

A comparison of this observation to the data obtained from multiple 122 materials [19] is particularly interesting. Contrary to the FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} family, these materials have a q_{z} dependent resonance mode where the ratio \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} is constant for q_{z}=\pi and seems to vary with T_{c} for q_{z}=0. Interestingly, the data presented in Fig. 4(b) is qualitatively similar to the q_{z}=0 data for the 122 compounds. This suggests that when three dimensional, the resonance relevant for superconductivity, and which should be compared to either T_{c} or \Delta, might be the one measured at q_{z}=0.

It is worth noting that for the 122 materials, the highest ratios \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} (at q_{z}=0) are obtained for the lowest concentrations of dopant, where electronic correlations are stronger. This is consistent with our observations of \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} decreasing with applied pressure in FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4}, as applying pressure likely increases orbital overlap and hybridization, implying a more itinerant and less correlated system. Within this context, the ratio of these energy scales relevant in unconventional superconductivity, \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c}, seems to be an indication of the strength of the correlations in the system. This is also supported by higher observed ratios of \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} in cuprates, which are notoriously more correlated. [18]

Since the neutron spin resonance is often compared to the superconducting gap \Delta, [18, 19] it is interesting to examine the consequences of our results for the underlying pairing mechanism. Unfortunately, data of \Delta as a function of pressure are lacking. Therefore we discuss our results in the context of a simple Hubbard model and consider the aforementioned model of sign change of the superconducting order parameter. [14] Within this context, a screened, on-site, intraorbital Coulomb interaction U renormalizes \omega_{r} to a value lower than the energy of the particle-hole continuum 2\Delta. [30, 31] Pressure increases orbital overlap, effectively reducing U, and in turn increasing the ratio of \omega_{r}/2\Delta. In the very weak-coupling limit, we expect \omega_{r}/2\Delta\approx 1. [30, 31] For either increasing or constant \omega_{r}/2\Delta, the observed decrease of \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} between 0 and 1 GPa implies a reduction of the superconducting pairing strength 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} (even though paradoxically the energy scale T_{c} has risen).

To conclude, this work further demonstrates that inelastic neutron scattering in conjunction with applied pressure is a powerful approach to unraveling the relationship between spin excitations and unconventional superconductivity. We have performed a pressure dependent study of the neutron spin resonance and superconducting transition temperature of an unconventional FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} superconductor up to 1.5 GPa. Free from any constraint induced by chemical substitution, we have shown that the energy and the intensity of the resonance increase with applied pressure up to 1 GPa and then stabilize. The similarity of this qualitative pressure dependent behavior with that of T_{c} confirms a correlation between those two characteristic energies and the important role of spin excitations in Fe-based unconventional superconductivity.

###### Abstract

We have carried out a pressure study of the unconventional superconductor FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} up to 1.5 GPa by neutron scattering, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The neutron spin resonance energy and the superconducting transition temperature have been extracted as a function of applied pressure in samples obtained from the same crystal. Both increase with pressure up to a maximum at \approx1.3 GPa, directly demonstrating a correlation between these two fundamental parameters of unconventional superconductivity. A comparison between the quantitative evolution of T_{c} and the resonance energy as a function of applied pressure is also discussed. These measurements serve to demonstrate the feasibility of using pressure dependent inelastic neutron scattering to explore the relationship between the resonance energy and T_{c} in unconventional superconductors.

Unconventional superconductors such as cuprates, heavy-fermion compounds, iron pnictides, and chalcogenides all share some notable features. Perhaps the most salient is the presence of static or dynamic magnetism throughout the superconducting region of the phase diagram.[1, 2] A hallmark of this is a collective spin excitation that appears as a peak in the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility \chi^{\prime\prime}({\bf Q},\omega).[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] often called the spin resonance. This resonance is localized in both wave vector and energy transfer, and appears below the superconducting transition temperature. Although still open to interpretation,[13] a commonly held view is that this signal originates from a sign change of the superconducting order parameter on different parts of the Fermi surface.[14] This implies an unconventional mechanism with a repulsive interaction in momentum space, as opposed to the attractive interaction in BCS theory. Within this picture, the existence of the resonance is definitive evidence of unconventional superconductivity.[15] The observation of this signal in iron superconductors[9, 10, 11, 12, 16] provided further stimulus to explore the relationship between the resonance energy \omega_{r} and other characteristic energy scales such as the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} or the superconducting gap \Delta.[17, 18, 19, 1, 17]

Recent studies show that there is ambiguity in interpreting the relationship between T_{c} and \omega_{r},[18, 19] in large part due to the difficulty in separating the intrinsic and extrinsic effects of chemical doping, such as disorder, inhomogeneity, and the influence of static magnetic order. Consequently, a clean tuning parameter such as pressure has the potential to avoid these complications and yield further insight into the relationship of the resonance and unconventional superconductivity. Unfortunately, pressure dependent inelastic neutron scattering measurements are notoriously difficult and to date we are unaware of any reported studies of the spin resonance as a function of applied pressure. Thus the work presented here provides a demonstration of an experimental approach to explore the relationship between the spin excitation spectrum and unconventional superconductivity.

The FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} family is a good candidate for such studies, as large single crystals can be grown and T_{c} shows a substantial sensitivity to applied pressure.[20, 21] In particular, for compositions close to x\approx 0.43, the samples do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and T_{c} increases with pressure, reaching a maximum at \approx2 GPa,[22] a pressure amenable to a number of experimental techniques. Here, we present inelastic and elastic neutron scattering, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements of FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} (T_{c}\approx 12 K) up to 1.5 GPa. T_{c} and \omega_{r} show a qualitatively similar behavior, although \omega_{r} does not increase as much as T_{c} with increasing pressure, suggesting the lack of proportionality between these two energies.

The FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} crystal studied here was grown using a modified Bridgman technique.[23] The stoichiometry was determined by energy dispersive x-ray analysis, resulting in 1.02\pm 0.02 for Fe, 0.6\pm 0.02 for Te, and 0.4\pm 0.02 for Se. All the high pressure measurements were performed on samples from the same crystal growth (the same large single crystal). The inelastic neutron scattering experiments under pressure were performed on the HB-3 triple axis spectrometer at the High Flux Isotope Reactor of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) with collimations of 48'-60'-80'-120'. A McWhan piston-cylinder pressure cell[24] was used with 3M FC-75 fluorant as the pressure medium. A 0.5 g crystal was encapsulated in the inner BeCu neutron pressure cell (9\times h=5 mm \times 10 mm) with the [1\bar{1}0] direction vertical. Room temperature neutron powder diffraction was performed using the SNAP diffractometer at the Spallation Neutron Source at ORNL. NaCl powder was ground into a 0.8 g FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} sample to use as a pressure calibration standard. The sample was loaded into a Paris-Edinburgh press fitted with single toroid cubic boron nitride anvils, with the incident beam through the TiZr null scattering alloy gasket. Pressure was determined by application of the isothermal NaCl equation of state determined by Decker[25] to the refined lattice parameters obtained at each measured pressure from LeBail fits using the Gas software suite.[26] High pressure resistivity measurements on a single crystal were performed in an easyLab Mcell 30. The electrical contacts were made using DuPont 4929N silver paste. The pressure was determined during the pressurization  at room temperature with calibrated manganin wire and was also calculated from the applied load. Fluorinert (FC-75) was used as the pressure medium. The dc magnetization was measured on a single crystal by a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS) in a BeCu piston cylinder cell using Daphne7373 as the pressure medium. The pressure was calibrated using the superconducting transition of Sn.

According to the different calibration tests for the McWhan pressure cell [24] (by measuring the resistance of a manganin wire under pressure), the chosen external forces applied on the pressure cell should result in room temperature pressures of \approx0, 1, and 1.5 GPa [Fig. 1(b)]. The lattice parameters of the large single crystal of FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} used for the inelastic measurements were extracted from _th-2p_ scans through the (110) and (001) Bragg reflections [see Figs. 1(a) and 1(c)] at room temperature on the HB-3 spectrometer for the three different chosen pressure points (applied forces of, respectively, 1, 7, and 10 tons). The relative decrease of these lattice parameters are compared to the absolute values of these same lattice parameters obtained from neutron powder diffraction using the SNAP diffractometer. For this purpose, the first pressure point, ambient pressure/1 ton, was considered as a common reference and the HB-3 lattice parameters were normalized to the SNAP ones. The measured relative changes (from HB-3) were then compared to the lattice parameters extracted from the SNAP data [see Fig. 1(a)]. While the lattice parameter a shows higher values than expected from neutron powder diffraction for these pressures, the lattice parameter c shows slightly lower values, which suggests that the actual pressures at room temperature on the single crystal are close to the expected ones. One of the first visible effects of applied pressure, besides the reduction of the lattice parameters, is the broadening of the crystal mosaic. The rocking curves show a significant increase in their width [see Fig. 1(d) and the inset]. A Lorentzian-squared function provides a better description of the rocking curves than a classical Gaussian function.

In the FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} family, the neutron spin resonance has been shown to be two dimensional, centered at a **Q** of (1/2 1/2 L), where L indicates the irrelevant direction. [11] Above T_{c}, the spin excitations in FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} originate from an incommensurate wave vector near (1/2 1/2 L). [27] Below T_{c} there is a suppression of low energy spectral weight transferred to higher energy, resulting in the appearance of a resonance peak at \omega_{s}\approx 6.5 meV. Constant-Q scans at (1/2 1/2 L) were measured on the FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} crystal at 0, 1, and 1.5 GPa. The same superconductivity induced redistribution of spectral weight can be seen in the constant-Q scans under applied pressure, as seen in Fig. 2(b) for 1 GPa and Fig. 2(c) for

  1.5 GPa. In each case there is a clear additional signal in the inelastic spectrum corresponding to the spin resonance. While the background introduced by the pressure cell is substantial, it is not insurmountable and is indicated in Fig. 2(c). This definitively shows the viability of such an experiment and that the resonance can be experimentally explored as a function of applied pressure.

The resonance signal is obtained by subtracting the data collected above T_{c} from the data collected below T_{c}. This procedure results in a positive difference centered at the resonance energy \omega_{r} and an associated negative difference at lower energy corresponding to the opening of a gap in the spin excitation spectrum. Figure 2(a) displays this signal measured on a large single crystal of the same concentration outside of the pressure cell, indicating the expected resonance at \omega_{r}=6.6 meV. For comparison, Fig. 2(d) shows the results of similar measurements on the 0.5 g sample (of the same concentration but different growth) within the pressure apparatus, confirming the presence of the resonance at the same energy. The effect of applied pressure on the resonance is illustrated by Figs. 2(e) and 2(f) (1 and 1.5 GPa, respectively). First, \omega_{r} is shifted to a higher energy at 1 GPa (\omega_{r}=7.5 meV), but does not increase further at higher pressure. Second, the spectral weight enhancement below T_{c} follows the same qualitative behavior as \omega_{r} with a clear increase at 1 GPa and does not increase further at 1.5 GPa.

The large thermal mass of the pressure cell combined with long counting times prohibited an accurate determination of T_{c} from the onset of the resonance. Therefore the pressure dependence of T_{c} was determined from resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystal samples from the same growth as the crystal used for the inelastic neutron scattering measurements (see Fig. 3). Although different methods are commonly used to extract T_{c} from resistivity data, for completeness we adopt two metrics: (1) the onset of the drop in resistivity due to the appearance of superconductivity (T_{c} onset) and (2) the temperature at which the resistivity achieves the minimum value (T_{c} min).

The magnetic susceptibility data show broad transitions [see Fig. 3(a)], as previously observed for lower concentrations of Se (x\leqslant 0.4). In those cases, T_{c} is usually defined as the temperature where \chi_{\text{mag}} starts to decrease.[28] Although the broadness of the transition potentially indicates a distribution of T_{c}'s, the energy of the resonance from the neutron scattering data is well defined, suggesting a unique bulk behavior.[29] For the following discussion, we will use the definition T_{c}(\chi_{\text{mag}}) as described above. Although we believe our neutron scattering data is consistent with a narrow distribution of transition temperatures, we note that a hypothetical distribution of T_{c}'s in our sample, together with a sharp resonance signal, can only be understood if the resonance energy and T_{c} are effectively decoupled.[29]

Here, as shown in Fig. 4(a), despite a constant offset in absolute value, T_{c} obtained from all three methods shows similar qualitative behavior, supporting the reliability of our definitions. At ambient pressure, previous measurements for this concentration suggest a T_{c} of about 14 K as extracted from the onset of resistivity. Our value of 13.6\pm 0.4 K is slightly less than this value. Such discrepancies are not uncommon, and this is precisely why we use pressure to overcome this problem by measuring the relative change of T_{c} in one sample rather than absolute values. Here, T_{c} increases with pressure by \approx50% at \approx1.3 GPa, and then remains constant or decreases slightly at higher pressures. Consistently, similar qualitative behavior was observed in other members of the FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} family.[20, 21, 22]

The lowest value of \chi_{\text{mag}}, at the lowest temperature (5 K), is a manifestation of the screening effect in the sample. \chi_{5\text{ K}} strongly decreases with applied pressure, reaching a plateau above \approx1 GPa [see Fig. 3(a), left]. This increased screening

(b) T_{c} dependence of the \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} ratio of FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.4} for all pressures (squares for 0 GPa, circles for 1 GPa, and triangles for 1.5 GPa), and all definitions of the transition temperature. The horizontal dotted lines correspond to the value of \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} at 0 GPa for all three definitions of T_{c}. The horizontal red line corresponds to \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c}=4.6, as previously observed for iron superconductors (Refs. [17] and [18]).

  effect could indicate an enhancement of the superconducting volume fraction with pressure. As the strength of the resonance signal scales with superconducting volume fraction, we would expect a change in volume fraction would result in a change in inelastic neutron scattering intensity, as observed experimentally [see Figs. 2(d)-2(f)]. Whether the intensity increase is due to a changing volume fraction or is caused by a direct link between T_{c} and the resonance spectral weight remains unclear.

To provide further insight into the implications of our measurements we make the assumption that the T_{c}'s which have been determined from bulk measurements are representative of the behavior of the large single crystal. Under this assumption \omega_{r}(P) and T_{c}(P) can be relevantly compared. Figure 4(a) displays such a comparison, where \omega_{r} is expressed in units of kelvin and scaled by a constant to coincide with the lowest estimate of T_{c}(P) at ambient pressure. Despite a qualitative similarity in the behavior of \omega_{r}(P) and T_{c}(P), the resonance energy does not increase nearly as rapidly as T_{c}. To further clarify this point, Fig. 4(b) shows the ratio \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} as a function of T_{c}. Both Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) suggest that \omega_{r} is not proportional to T_{c}. This fact is independent of the definition we choose for T_{c}. These measurements show the feasibility of inelastic neutron scattering as a function of applied pressure for such studies, and future measurements will be of high interest to compare these results with other unconventional superconductors.

A comparison of this observation to the data obtained from multiple 122 materials [19] is particularly interesting. Contrary to the FeTe_{1-x}Se_{x} family, these materials have a q_{z} dependent resonance mode where the ratio \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} is constant for q_{z}=\pi and seems to vary with T_{c} for q_{z}=0. Interestingly, the data presented in Fig. 4(b) is qualitatively similar to the q_{z}=0 data for the 122 compounds. This suggests that when three dimensional, the resonance relevant for superconductivity, and which should be compared to either T_{c} or \Delta, might be the one measured at q_{z}=0.

It is worth noting that for the 122 materials, the highest ratios \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} (at q_{z}=0) are obtained for the lowest concentrations of dopant, where electronic correlations are stronger. This is consistent with our observations of \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} decreasing with applied pressure in FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4}, as applying pressure likely increases orbital overlap and hybridization, implying a more itinerant and less correlated system. Within this context, the ratio of these energy scales relevant in unconventional superconductivity, \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c}, seems to be an indication of the strength of the correlations in the system. This is also supported by higher observed ratios of \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} in cuprates, which are notoriously more correlated. [18]

Since the neutron spin resonance is often compared to the superconducting gap \Delta, [18, 19] it is interesting to examine the consequences of our results for the underlying pairing mechanism. Unfortunately, data of \Delta as a function of pressure are lacking. Therefore we discuss our results in the context of a simple Hubbard model and consider the aforementioned model of sign change of the superconducting order parameter. [14] Within this context, a screened, on-site, intraorbital Coulomb interaction U renormalizes \omega_{r} to a value lower than the energy of the particle-hole continuum 2\Delta. [30, 31] Pressure increases orbital overlap, effectively reducing U, and in turn increasing the ratio of \omega_{r}/2\Delta. In the very weak-coupling limit, we expect \omega_{r}/2\Delta\approx 1. [30, 31] For either increasing or constant \omega_{r}/2\Delta, the observed decrease of \omega_{r}/k_{B}T_{c} between 0 and 1 GPa implies a reduction of the superconducting pairing strength 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c} (even though paradoxically the energy scale T_{c} has risen).

To conclude, this work further demonstrates that inelastic neutron scattering in conjunction with applied pressure is a powerful approach to unraveling the relationship between spin excitations and unconventional superconductivity. We have performed a pressure dependent study of the neutron spin resonance and superconducting transition temperature of an unconventional FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} superconductor up to 1.5 GPa. Free from any constraint induced by chemical substitution, we have shown that the energy and the intensity of the resonance increase with applied pressure up to 1 GPa and then stabilize. The similarity of this qualitative pressure dependent behavior with that of T_{c} confirms a correlation between those two characteristic energies and the important role of spin excitations in Fe-based unconventional superconductivity.
