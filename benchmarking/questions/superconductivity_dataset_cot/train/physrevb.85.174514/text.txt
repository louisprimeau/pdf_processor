###### Abstract

We present evidence of type-I superconductivity in single crystals of ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), from magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity measurements: low critical temperatures \(T_{c}\) = 2.1-2.2 K; field-induced second-to first-order phase transition in the specific heat, critical fields less than 240 Oe; and low Ginzburg-Landau coefficients \(\kappa\approx\) 0.23 and 0.30 for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively, are all transits of a type-I-superconducting ground state. These observations render ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) two of only several type-I superconducting compounds, with most other superconductors being type II (compounds and alloys) or type I (elemental metals and metaloids).

## I Introduction

Despite the large number of known conventional and unconventional superconductors (SCs), new findings still emerge even from simple, binary intermetallic systems. The majority of the metallic elements are superconducting with small values of the critical temperatures \(T_{c}\).[1] It has been noted[2] that intermetallic compounds often have \(T_{c}\)values higher than those of the constituent elements, as is the case in Nb\({}_{5}\)Sn,[3] V\({}_{3}\)Si,[4] ZrB\({}_{2}\), and NbB\({}_{2}\).[5] In this work, we present thermodynamic and transport measurements on single crystals of _R_Ga\({}_{3}\) (\(R=\) Sc or Lu), formed with superconducting Ga with \(T_{c}=1.09\) K (Ref. [1]) and either nonsuperconducting Sc or superconducting Lu whose critical temperature is \(T_{c}=0.1\) K.[1]

Past studies focused on the synthesis of polycrystalline samples of _R_Ga\({}_{3}\), with reports on single crystals limited to de Haas van Alphen measurements.[6] Pluzhnikov _et al.[6]_ characterized the geometry of the Fermi surface of three related intermetallic compounds, _R_Ga\({}_{3}\) (\(R=\) Sc, Lu) and LuIn\({}_{3}\). Together with findings from band structure calculations[7] on the same systems, these reports suggested great similarities between the electronic properties of ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\). Superconductivity below 2.3 K in LuGa\({}_{3}\) have already been mentioned,[8] but measurements of thermodynamic and transport properties of both ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) have so far been limited to \(T>4.2\) K.[9, 10] The similarities in the electronic structures of ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) suggest that, if the superconductivity in the latter compound is confirmed, the former is likely to also display a superconducting ground state. In the current paper we show evidence that indeed both _R_Ga\({}_{3}\) (\(R=\) Sc and Lu) are superconducting. The low critical temperatures \(T_{c}\) around 2.2 K and small critical fields \(H_{c}<240\) Oe point to type-I superconductivity in both these compounds. Additional supporting evidence for the type-I superconductivity is provided by the field-dependent specific heat and low values of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coefficient \(\kappa\approx\) 0.23 and 0.3 for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively.

## II Experimental methods

The _R_Ga\({}_{3}\) compounds (\(R=\) Sc, Dy-Tm, Lu) crystallize in the cubic _Pm\(\overline{3}\)m_ space group, a structure suggested by Matthias[11] to be favorable for superconductivity. Single crystals of ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) were prepared using a self flux method by combining Sc or Lu (Hefa Rare Earth 99.999%) with Ga (Alfa Aesar 99.9999%). A \(R\):Ga ratio of 1:9 was mixed in an alumina crucible, heated up to 930 \({}^{\circ}\)C, and then slowly cooled down to 760 \({}^{\circ}\)C, followed by decanting of the residual flux in a centrifuge. Metallic cubic crystals with well-formed facets up to \(2\times 2\times 2\) mm\({}^{3}\) in size were obtained. The crystals were then wrapped in Ta foil and annealed at 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C for a week. Temperature- and field-dependent magnetization measurements with the magnetic field \(H\) parallel to the crystallographic axis \(H||a\) were performed in a Quantum Design (QD) Magnetic Property Measurement System, while specific heat data were collected in a QD Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) using an adiabatic relaxation method. Alternating current resistivity measurements from 0.4 K to 300 K were carried out using the standard four-probe method in the QD PPMS, with the current along the \(a\) axis \(i=0.5\) mA and \(f=17.77\) Hz.

Powder x-ray diffraction data, shown in Fig. 1 for ScGa\({}_{3}\), were collected for both compounds in a Rigaku D/Max diffractometer using CuK\(\alpha\) radiation. The patterns for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) were refined with the cubic space group _Pm\(\overline{3}\)m_, with lattice parameters \(a=4.09\) A and \(a=4.19\) A, respectively. A picture of a ScGa\({}_{3}\) crystal is also shown in the inset in Fig. 1. Traces of residual Ga flux are apparent in the powder pattern and are marked with asterisks in Fig. 1. Additional single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the crystal structure, stoichiometry, and purity of the ScGa\({}_{3}\) crystals.

## III Results and discussion

As-measured susceptibility data \(\chi=\) M/\(H\) for _R_Ga\({}_{3}\) in various applied magnetic fields \(H\) was scaled by \(4\pi\) and corrected for demagnetizing effects \(4\pi\)\(\chi_{\rm{eff}}=4\pi\)\(\chi/(1-N_{d}\chi)\) as shown in Fig. 2. The demagnetizing factor, \(N_{d}\approx 1/3\),[12, 13] is associated with the cubic geometry of the crystals. As anticipated from their electronic properties,[6] both \(R=\) Sc [Fig. 2(a)] and Lu [Fig. 2(b)] compounds display similar superconducting ground states below 2.2-2.3 K. Increasing magnetic field suppresses the transition for ScGa\({}_{3}\) [Fig. 2(a)], such that \(T_{c}\) becomes smaller than 1.8 K for \(H\approx 80\) Oe. Figure 2(b) illustrates the similarity between the \(H=5\) Oe \(M(T)\) data for ScGa\({}_{3}\) (squares) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) (triangles), for both zero-field-cooled (solid symbols) and field-cooled (open symbols) data. The critical field \(H_{c}\) for each compound can also be estimated from the \(M(H)\) data, shown in Fig. 3. Taking the demagnetization effect into consideration, a more accurate estimate of the field \(H\) is \(H_{\rm eff}=H-N_{d}M\), where, as before, for a cube and \(H||a\), \(N_{d}\approx 1/3\). The resulting \(M(H_{\rm eff})\) isotherms are displayed in Fig. 3 (solid symbols, bottom axes) along with as-measured \(M(H)\) for \(T=1.8\) K (open symbols, top axes). The critical-field values \(H_{c}\), corresponding to the entrance to the normal state (\(M=0\)), are not changed when demagnetizing effects are taken into account for \(H||a\). The critical fields are remarkably low, \(H_{c}\) reaching only about 90 Oe at 1.8 K, the lowest temperature available for the magnetization measurements. Moreover, as is shown below, the critical fields for both compounds remain small down to 0.4 K. This observation, along with the small critical temperatures and the shape of the \(M(H)\) isotherms, indicates type-I superconductivity in both ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\). While most elemental SCs are type I, this is a rare occurrence in superconducting compounds, making ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) two of only a few such known systems.[14, 15, 16, 17, 18] It is therefore imperious to fully characterize the superconducting state in the \(R\)Ga\({}_{3}\) SCs. Specific heat and resistivity measurements allow us to extend the findings from magnetization data down to lower temperatures.

Field-dependent specific heat measurements for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) were carried out in fields up to 240 Oe, as shown in Fig. 4. As expected, a sharp peak is observed for field values \(H<240\) Oe, from which the critical temperature \(T_{c}\) can be determined as the point halfway between the peak and the normal state specific heat signal. Type-I superconductivity in both compounds is confirmed by the increase of the jump in specific heat between zero and nonzero applied magnetic field \(H\), indicating second- to first order phase transition. \(T_{c}\) for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) is suppressed from 2.1 K [open squares, Fig. 4(a)] and 2.0 K [open squares, Fig. 4(b)], respectively, at \(H=0\) to below 0.4 K at \(H=240\) Oe [solid line, Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)]. The normal state electronic specific heat coefficient

  \(\gamma_{n}\) and phonon specific heat coefficient \(\beta\) were estimated from the linear fit of the normal state (\(H=240\) Oe) specific heat below 8 K, plotted as \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) (not shown). Very similar \(\gamma_{n}\) values, 7.11 and 8.46 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\), were obtained for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively. The experimental \(\gamma_{n}\) values are larger than those estimated (\(\gamma_{n,\text{PPVW}}=2.4\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and 1.2 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) for LuGa\({}_{3}\)) from existing band structure calculations based on the Pseudopotential Plane-Wave Approximation (PPPW). 7 However, a more accurate estimate of \(\gamma_{n}\) results from the Full Potential Linear Augmented Plane-Wave Method (FPLAPW), 19 which gives \(\gamma_{n,\text{FPLAPW}}=7.1\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) for ScGa\({}_{3}\), identical with the experimental value of 7.11 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\). The superconducting electronic specific heat coefficient \(\gamma_{s}\) can also be determined from \(\gamma_{n}\) and the residual electronic specific heat coefficient \(\gamma_{\text{res}}\). The latter coefficient, \(\gamma_{\text{res}}\), estimated from \(C_{e}/T\) at \(T=0.4\) K and \(H=0\) [Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)], is much smaller than \(\gamma_{n}\) for both compounds. This results in \(\gamma_{s}=\gamma_{n}-\gamma_{\text{res}}\approx\gamma_{n}\) for both ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\). The entropy-conservation construct shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively, yields the same value for the jump in the electronic specific heat \(C_{e}\) at \(T_{c}\), \(\Delta C_{e}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}\approx 1.44\), consistent with BCS-type superconductivity. 20 One more similarity between the two compounds is the minimum excitation energy \(\Delta(0)\): from the low-temperature fit of the electronic specific heat \(C_{e}\propto e^{-\Delta/k_{B}T}\) [dashed lines in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d)], \(\Delta(0)\) is estimated to be 0.18 meV for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and 0.17 meV for LuGa\({}_{3}\). The Debye temperature \(\theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}N_{A}r^{4}k_{B}/\xi\beta)^{1/3}\), where \(r=4\) is the number of atoms per formula unit, can be determined using the phonon specific heat coefficient \(\beta\) (Table 1), also estimated from the linear fit of \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) (not shown). This yields \(\theta_{D}=660\) K for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and 232 K for LuGa\({}_{3}\). Moreover, the electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}\), can be determined using McMillan's theory: 21

\[\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})}{(1-0.62\mu^ {*})\ln(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})-1.04},\]

where \(\mu^{*}\) represents the repulsive screened Coulomb potential and is usually between 0.1 and 0.15. Setting \(\mu^{*}=0.13\), \(\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}=0.45\) and 0.55 for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively, which implies that both compounds are weakly coupled SCs.

From the specific heat data for both the superconducting (\(H=0\)) and the normal (\(H=240\) Oe) states, an estimate of the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\) can be obtained using the free energy relation. 22 The thermodynamic critical field values \(H_{c}=209\pm 10\) Oe for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and \(H_{c}=226\pm 10\) Oe for LuGa\({}_{3}\) are consistent with what has been observed in magnetization and specific heat data. The field- and temperature-dependent data can be summarized in the \(H\)-\(T\) phase diagram shown in Fig. 6 and discussed below.

Previously reported resistivity measurements 9, 10 on LuGa\({}_{3}\) were limited to temperatures above 4.2 K, while similar data had not been presented for ScGa\({}_{3}\). Figure 5 displays the \(H=0\) resistivity data for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) (solid and open symbols,

(c) and (d) Normal (\(H=240\) Oe) and superconducting (\(H=0\)) electronic specific heat \(C_{e}\), scaled by temperature \(T\). The entropy conservation construct gives the ratio \(\Delta C_{es}/\gamma_{n}T_{c}\approx 1.44\) for both ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), with the dashed line representing a fit of \(C_{e}/T\) to the expected BCS electronic specific heat.

  respectively). The superconducting transition (left inset) is around 2.2-2.3 K for both compounds. The apparently finite resistivity in the superconducting state is likely an artifact of the measurement: the overall resistivity values are very small for both compounds; below \(T_{c}\), the contact resistance, albeit small, might alter the measured voltage, which is very close to the instrument resolution. Above the transition and below 80 K for ScGa\({}_{3}\) or 70 K for LuGa\({}_{3}\), \(\rho(T)\) exhibits Fermi liquid behavior, as illustrated by the \(\Delta\rho\propto AT^{2}\) plot, with \(A=3.4\times 10^{-4}\) and \(6.1\times 10^{-4}\)\(\mu\Omega\)cm K\({}^{-2}\), respectively (right inset, Fig. 5). At higher temperatures a slight curvature of the resistivity is apparent. Fits to the Bloch-Gruneisen-Mott (BGM) relation [23] (solid lines, Fig. 5)

\[\rho=\rho_{0}+A\left(\frac{T}{\theta_{D}}\right)^{n}\int_{0}^{\theta_{D}/T} \frac{x^{n}dx}{(e^{x}-1)(1-e^{-x})}-kT^{3},\]

with \(n=2\) for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and \(n=3\) for LuGa\({}_{3}\), describe the data well up to room temperature, even higher than \(\theta_{D}/4\). This points to significant \(s\)-\(d\) band scattering, while the different exponents \(n\) suggest underlying differences in the electron-phonon scattering in the two compounds. The fits shown in Fig. 5 were performed using the \(\theta_{D}\) values determined from specific heat; the other BGM parameters were determined to be \(A=38.5\) and \(28.6\)\(\mu\Omega\)cm and \(k=1.3\times 10^{-7}\) and \(0.3\times 10^{-7}\)\(\mu\Omega\)cm/K\({}^{3}\), for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively. If the parameter \(\theta\) is also released for the BGM fits, equally good fits for \(n=2\) and \(n=3\) are achieved for ScGa\({}_{3}\), for \(\theta_{R}\) values between 320 K and 460 K, significantly smaller than the Debye temperature \(\theta_{D}=660\) K. For LuGa\({}_{3}\), the parameters remain nearly unchanged, with the best fit for \(n=3\) and \(\theta_{R}=230\) K virtually identical to \(\theta_{D}=232\) K.

Based on the Sommerfield coefficient extracted from the specific heat data, it is possible to estimate the London penetration depth \(\lambda_{L}(0)\), the coherence length \(\xi(0)\), and the GL parameter \(\kappa(0)=\lambda_{L}(0)/\xi(0)\). Since both ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) have one formula unit per unit cell, the conduction electron density \(n\), due to three electrons contributed by Sc and Lu, can be estimated as \(n=3/V\), where \(V\) is the volume of the unit cell. It results that \(n=4.39\times 10^{-2}\) A\({}^{-3}\) and \(n=4.08\times 10^{-2}\) A\({}^{-3}\) for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively. If a spherical Fermi surface is assumed for both compounds, the Fermi wave vector \(k_{F}\) can be roughly calculated as \(k_{F}=(3n\pi^{2})^{1/3}=1.09\) A\({}^{-1}\) for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and 1.07 A\({}^{-1}\) for LuGa\({}_{3}\). The effective electron mass can then be determined as \(m^{*}=\hbar^{2}k_{F}^{2}\gamma_{n}/\pi^{2}nk_{B}^{2}=0.30m_{0}\) and \(3.49m_{0}\) for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively, where \(m_{0}\) is the free electron mass. The London penetration depth is given as \(\lambda_{L}(0)=(m^{*}/\mu_{0}ne^{2})^{1/2}=59\) nm for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and 63 nm for LuGa\({}_{3}\). The coherence length is then determined as \(\xi=0.18\hbar k_{F}/k_{B}T_{c}m^{*}=0.26\)\(\mu\)m and \(0.21\)\(\mu\)m for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\), respectively. The GL parameter \(\kappa(0)=\lambda_{L}(0)/\xi(0)\) is thus 0.23 for ScGa\({}_{3}\) and 0.30 for LuGa\({}_{3}\). This indicates that both compounds are type-I SCs, since \(\kappa<1/\sqrt{2}\). By comparison, MgB\({}_{2}\) is an example of a type-II SC and its \(\kappa(0)\) is close to 26, [54] while \(\kappa(0)\) for LuRhSi\({}_{3}\), a reported type-I superconducting compound, is close to 0.25. [14]

## IV Conclusions

In summary, type-I superconductivity in ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) is reported, with the parameters characteristic of the superconducting state shown in Table 1. The shape of the \(M(H)\) isotherms (Fig. 3), field-induced second- to first-order phase transition in specific heat (Fig. 4), and low \(T_{c}\), \(H_{c}\), and \(\kappa\) values (Table 1) suggest that ScGa\({}_{3}\) and LuGa\({}_{3}\) are both type-I superconducting compounds. This is reflected also in the \(H\)-\(T\) phase diagram (Fig. 6), where the symbols represent experimental points from \(M(T)\) (squares), \(M(H)\) (triangles), and \(C_{P}\) (circles). These data are in good agreement with the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\) temperature dependence (solid lines). As suggested by the electronic properties, [6] the superconducting parameters for the two compounds are very similar, as are their \(H\)-\(T\) phase diagrams. A careful analysis of the crystal structure on one hand and the thermodynamic and transport properties of the type-I superconducting compounds on the other hand may offer valuable insights into the rare occurrence of type-I superconductivity in binary or ternary systems. The relatively small electron-phonon coupling parameter \(\lambda_{\text{el-ph}}\) indicates that both compounds are weakly coupled BCS SCs.
