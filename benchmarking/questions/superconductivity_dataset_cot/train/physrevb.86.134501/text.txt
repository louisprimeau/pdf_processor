###### Abstract

We report the observation of superconductivity in rare-earth metal countercalated compounds Yb_x_(_M_),HFNCl with \(M\) = NH3 and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The superconducting transition temperature is about 23 and 24.6 K for Yb0.2(NH3),HFNCl and Yb0.3(NH3),HFNCl, respectively. Replacing the NH3 with a larger molecule THF, the superconducting transition temperature increases to 25.2 K in Yb0.2(THF),HFNCl, which is almost the same as the highest _T_c reported in the alkali-metal intercalated HFNCl superconductors. The _T_c of Yb0.2(THF),HFNCl is apparently suppressed by pressure up to 0.5 GPa, while the pressure effect on _T_c becomes very small above 0.5 GPa. Our results suggest that for the most part, the superconductivity in these layered intercalated superconductors does not rely on intercalated metal ions, even magnetic ions.

## 1.0.1103/PhysRevB.86.134501

High-_T_c superconductivity has been observed in layered cuprates and recently discovered iron-based superconductors.[1, 2, 3] The proximity to magnetically ordered states for these systems suggests that the magnetic interactions are the crucial force for Cooper pairing in such high-_T_c superconductivity, which gives rise to the unconventional nature of the superconductivity in these systems. Superconductivity in various other exotic materials, such as Na2CoO2, Sr2RuO4, and heavy-fermion systems, was also found to be closely connected to magnetism.[4, 5, 6] However, for another type of superconducting material of the layered metallonitride halides (_M_NN_X_, \(M\) = Ti, Zr, Hf; \(X\) = Cl, Br, I) with the maximum _T_c as high as 25.5 K,7 their parent compounds are band insulators, and superconductivity seems to have no correlation with magnetism.[8] There exist two types of layered nitride compounds: one is the (FeOCl)-type structure (so-called \(a\) structure) with a two-dimensional (2D) metal-nitrogen (_M_N) layer of a rectangular lattice; the other is the (SmSI)-type structure (so-called \(b\) structure) with a 2D _M_N layer of a honeycomb lattice.[9] For the former, KxTiNCl was reported to display superconductivity with _T_c = 16 K.[10] For the latter, usually with \(M\) = Hf,Zr and \(X\) = Cl, a maximum of _T_c = 25.5 K has been achieved in Li2(THF),HFNCl.7 The parent compounds of the latter, so-called _b_-_M_NCl, consist of an alternative stacking of honeycomb MN bilayers sandwiched by Cl bilayers.[11] Superconductivity is usually induced through doping charge carriers by means alkali-metal intercalation or producing the Cl deficiency.[12, 13] Unlike the large pressure effect on _T_c observed in cuprates or iron-based superconductors, the _T_c in this type of superconductors decreases slightly as the pressure increases.[14, 15] However, for countercalated _b_-ZrNCl and _b_-HfNCl, the interlayer spacing would strongly affect the superconducting transition temperature. An increase of the basal spacing would lead to a reduction of the negligible warping along the _K_z direction, and thus to an increase in the nesting of the Fermi surface.[16] It is assumed that a modification of the Fermi surface would increase the pairing interaction among the electrons, which would enhance _T_c, and the maximum _T_c is found when the basal spacing increases to approximately 15 A in this type of material.[17]

In two-dimensional superconductors, spin fluctuation may lead to unconventional pairing, and high-_T_c superconductivity might emerge.[18, 19] Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)[20] and muon spin relaxation (_m_SR) experiments[21, 22] revealed the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity in this intercalated layered nitride _M_NCl. The _M_N bilayer honeycomb structure is thought to play a major role in superconductivity.[8] The NMR Knight shift suggested a spin-singlet pairing,[23] and tunneling spectroscopy[24, 25] as well as specific heat[26] revealed a fully open _s_-wave-like gap. The tunneling-current measurements[27, 28] and specific heat[31] revealed quite a large superconducting gap with the ratio \(2\Delta/k_{\text{B}}T\approx 4.6\)-5.6 or even larger, suggesting strong-coupling superconductivity. However, some recent results, such as the anisotropic gap in the large doping level inferred by _m_SR (Ref. [29]) and the absence of a coherence peak in the spin-lattice-relaxation rate revealed by NMR experiment,[30] suggested unconventional pairing mechanisms. Moreover, relatively high _T_c with an extremely low density of states at the Fermi level,[32, 26, 31, 23] weak electron-phonon coupling,[32, 33, 31, 32] and a small isotope effect[34, 35] also favor the unconventional pairing mechanisms in these intercalated _b_-_M_NCl superconductors. The mystery of the superconductivity for the intercalated _b_-_M_NCl compounds has yet to be solved.

In this paper, we report the discovery of superconductivity by countercalating magnetic rare-earth ions of ytterbium with NH3 or THF molecules in HfNCl. Ytterbium was cointercalated with NH3 between HfNCl layers by the liquid ammonia method at room temperature, instead of previous methods of reacting in alkali-organic salt/organic solution,[7] electrochemical intercalation,[36] or using a solid-state reaction with K3N.[37] Superconductivity with _T_c of ~23 or ~24.6 K can be found in Yb2(NH3)3,HFNCl depending on the Yb content. The THF molecule can also be cointercalated with ytterbium into HfNCl, and superconductivity with _T_c as high as 25.2 K was observed from magnetic susceptibility, which is nearly the same as the reported maximum _T_c in the alkali-metal intercalated HfNCl compounds. The pressure effect of this sample is negative; \(dT_{\text{c}}/dP\) is about \(-0.6\) K/GPa below 0.5 GPa and it becomes \(-0.16\) K/GPa above 0.5 GPa.

_b_-HFNCl was synthesized by a reaction of Hf powder and gasiified NH4Cl in an ammonia environment at 923 K for 30 min. Then the product was sealed in a quartz tube followed by a vapor transport recrystallized process from the low-temperature side to the high-temperature side at a temperature gradient of 1023-1123 K with the aid of a small amount of NH4Cl as a transport agent. We can obtained two types of Yb3(NH3)3,HfNCl by adjusting the Yb content: 0.1 g of recrystallized HfNCl together with 0.053 or 0.068 g of ytterbium. Then the mixture was loaded in a 50 mL autoclave which was cooled with liquid nitrogen; the autoclave was slowly filled with 15 mL liquid ammonia and sealed. The sealed autoclave was kept at room temperature for one to three days before it was opened and dried in a glove box. The products were rinsed using liquid ammonia to eliminate soluble impurities, thus we could obtain the final product. The actual Yb concentration (_x_) of these two samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and the actual \(x\) values are 0.2 and 0.3, respectively. Yb0.2(THF)3HfNCl can be synthesized by immersing the Yb0.2(NH3)3,HfNCl powder into a THF solution for one to two days; however, we cannot obtain Yb0.3(THF)3HfNCl using the same method. All the experiments were performed in an Ar atmosphere to prevent air and water contamination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Smartlab-9 diffractometer (Rikagu) using Cu _K_a radiation. XRD was carried out with samples sealed in capillaries that were made of special glass No. 10 and purchased from Hilgenberg GmbH. The magnetization measurement was performed using SQUID MPMS-5T (Quantum Design). The magnetization under pressure was measured by incorporating a copper-beryllium pressure cell (EasyLab) into SQUID MPMS (Quantum Design). The sample was first placed in a teflon cell (EasyLab) with coal oil (EasyLab) as the pressure media. Then, the teflon cell was set in the copper-beryllium pressure cell for magnetization measurement.

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of _b_-HfNCl, Yb0.2(NH3)3,HfNCl, Yb0.3(NH3)3,HfNCl, and Yb0.2(THF)3 HfNCl using Cu _K_a radiation. The XRD pattern of pristine _b_-HfNCl can be well indexed based on the space group \(R\)3_m_, and the lattice parameters are determined to be \(a\) = 3.58 A and \(c\) = 27.71 A, which is consistent with the previous report.7 In comparison with pristine _b_-HfNCl, the XRD patterns of Yb0.2(NH3)3,HfNCl, Yb0.3(NH3)3,HfNCl, and Yb0.2(THF)3HfNCl can be indexed based on the space group \(P\)3_m_. The lattice parameters are determined to be \(a\) = 3.59 A and \(c\) = 11.95 A for Yb0.2(NH3)3,HfNCl, and \(a\) = 3.59 A and \(c\) = 13.20 A for Yb0.3(NH3)3,HfNCl, respectively. The lattice parameters become \(a\) = 3.59A and \(c\) = 15.05 A for Yb0.2(THF)3HfNCl. The lattice parameters in the _ab_ plane are almost unchanged for all the intercalated samples, but the stacking pattern of the layers is changed so much, leading to the change in the space group from \(R\)3_m_ to \(P\)3_m_. The \(d\) spacing between HfNCl layers increases from 9.24 A for pristine _b_-HfNCl to 11.95 and 13.20 A for superconducting Yb0.2(NH3)3,HfNCl and Yb0.3(NH3)3,HfNCl, and to 15.05 A for superconducting Yb0.2(THF)3,HfNCl, respectively. The interlayer spacing \(d\) between _M_NCl (_M_ = Zr or Hf) layers is strongly dependent on the amounts and types of metal ions and the countercalated solvent molecules in intercalated _M_NCl superconductors. The _c_-axis lattice parameter of \(c\) = 11.95 A for Yb0.2(NH3)3,HfNCl is nearly the same as \(c\) = 12.1 A of Li0.3(NH3)3,HfNCl.16 This indicates that the stacking structure for NH3 coincidental HfNCl with Yb should be similar to that of Li0.37(NH3)3,HfNCl, while for Yb0.3(NH3)3,HfNCl, the \(d\) spacing increases to 13.20 A, which may be due to the different Yb amount and orientation of NH3. The spacing between _M_NCl (_M_ = Zr or Hf) layers increases to 14.9 or 18.5 A for Li0.7(THF)3,ZrNCl,38 while it increases to 13.6 or 18.7 A (Ref. [16]) for Li0.7(THF)3,HfNCl. The different spacing between MNC layers depends strongly on the amounts of lithium and the orientation of THF. The _c_-axis parameter increases to 15.05 A for Yb0.2(THF)3,HfNCl, which is very close to 14.9 A for Li0.7(THF)3,ZrNCl. This suggests that the stacking structure of Yb0.2(THF)3,HfNCl is the same as that of Li0.7(THF)3,ZrNCl. The schematic structural models for pristine HfNCl, Yb0.2(NH3)3,HfNCl, Yb0.3(NH3)3,HfNCl, and Yb0.2(THF)3,HfNCl are proposed as shown in Fig. 2, respectively.

  superconducting Yb0.2(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl, Yb0.3(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl, and Yb0.2(THF)\({}_{3}\)HfNCl is shown in Fig. 3(a). The ZFC susceptibilities shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a) indicate a clear superconducting transition at about 23 K for Yb0.2(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl, at 24.6 K for Yb0.3(NH\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl, and at 25.2 K for Yb0.2(THF)\({}_{3}\)HfNCl, respectively. The shielding fractions estimated from the ZFC data were about 170%, 145%, and 160% for Yb0.2(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl, Yb0.3(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl, and Yb0.2(THF)\({}_{3}\)HfNCl, respectively. Such large values might be due to the demagnetizing effect of the tiny single crystals contained in our samples. An interlayer spacing \(d\) dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) for all the superconducting samples is shown in Fig. 3(b). \(T_{\rm c}\) increases slightly from 23 to 25.2 K as interlayer spacing \(d\) increases from 11.95 to 15.05 K. A similar behavior has been observed in Li\({}_{x}\)\({}_{M}\)\({}_{x}\)HNNCl (\(M\) = NH\({}_{3}\) and THF).[16] The inset of Fig. 3(b) shows the isothermal magnetization hysteresis for Yb0.2(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl at 5 K. Similar behavior in the \(M\)-H is observed for the samples of Yb0.3(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl and Yb0.2(THF)\({}_{3}\)HfNCl. The lower critical field (\(H_{\rm c1}\)) for all the superconducting samples is around 80 Oe, which is the same as that of alkali-metal countercalated HfNCl.[38] Lattice parameters and \(T_{\rm c}\) of Yb\({}_{3}\)(\(M\))\({}_{y}\)HfNCl (\(M\) = NH\({}_{3}\) and THF) are summarized in Table 1.

Within the

The inset shows the enlarged area around \(T_{\rm c}\). (b) Interlayer spacing \(d\) dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) for all the superconducting samples. The inset shows the isothermal magnetization hysteresis of Yb0.2(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)),HfNCl taken at 5 K.

  weak-coupling BCS theory, the upper critical field \(H_{\rm c2}\) at \(T=0\) K can be determined by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) equation [39]\(H_{\rm c2}(0)=0.693[-(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)]_{T_{\rm c}}T_{\rm c}\). Using the data of \(H_{\rm c2}\) (T) derived from the susceptibility measurement, one obtains \([-(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)]_{T_{\rm c}}\) to be about 0.25 and 0.38 T/K for Yb\({}_{0.2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)HFNCl and Yb\({}_{0.2}\)(THF)\({}_{3}\)HFNCl, respectively. Thus, \(H_{\rm c2}(0)\) can be estimated to be 4 and 6.6 T for Yb\({}_{0.2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)HfNCl and Yb\({}_{0.2}\)(THF)\({}_{3}\)HfNCl, respectively.

Figure 5(a) shows the temperature dependence of the susceptibility in ZFC measurements for Yb\({}_{0.2}\)(THF)\({}_{3}\)HfNCl under various pressures. The inset of Fig. 5(a) shows the enlarged area around \(T_{\rm c}\). \(T_{\rm c}\) is defined as the temperature at which the susceptibility starts to decrease. The pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) was shown in Fig. 5(b). \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases upon increasing the pressure. \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases at a relatively quick speed with \(dT_{\rm c}/dP=-0.6\) K/GPa below 0.5 GPa, while the pressure effect becomes very small above 0.5 GPa with \(dT_{\rm c}/dP=-0.16\) K/GPa. Such behavior is similar to the observation in the alkali-metal intercalated HfNCl and ZrNCl [14, 15].

Electron-doping of \(\beta\)-HfNCl is usually realized by the intercalation of alkali metals or the cointercalation of alkali metals with molecules. Here, we report superconductivity in electron-doped HfNCl by cointercalation of rare-earth magnetic ions with molecules. It is striking that the maximum \(T_{\rm c}\) of 25.2 K observed in Yb\({}_{0.2}\)(THF)\({}_{3}\)HfNCl is almost the same as the highest \(T_{\rm c}\) in the alkali metals cointercalation with THF. This indicates that superconductivity in the intercalated HfNCl does not rely on the different intercalated ions, even magnetic ions. It is intriguing that the intercalation of magnetic ions of rare-earth metal Yb does not affect the superconductivity relative to the intercalation of alkali-metal ions. This indicates that magnetism does not suppress superconductivity, which is evidence of unconventional superconductivity. \(T_{\rm c}\) increases from 23 to 25.2 K upon increasing the interlayer spacing from 11.95 A for Yb\({}_{0.2}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{3}\)HfNCl to 15.05 A for Yb\({}_{0.2}\)(THF)\({}_{3}\)HfNCl. Such a slight enhancement of \(T_{\rm c}\) induced by a large increase of the interlayer spacing indicates a good two-dimensional electronic system for the intercalated HfNCl superconductors, which could be the reason why superconductivity in intercalated HfNCl does not rely on intercalated ions. An interesting question is whether \(T_{\rm c}\) could be raised to above 25.5 K in the intercalated HfNCl system or not.
