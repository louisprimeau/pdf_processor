###### Abstract

The crystal structure of the high-temperature superconductor HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) has been determined from powder neutron-diffraction experiments up to pressures of 8.5 GPa. Complete structural refinements were carried out on the experimental data taken at (approximate) pressures of \(<\)0.5, 3.5, 6.0, and 8.5 GPa. One of the most significant features to emerge from this study is the extreme sensitivity of the apical Cu-O bond to applied pressure. Between our ambient and high-pressure measurements the apical Cu-O bond length decreases by some 10.5%. In contrast, over the same pressure range, we have recorded significantly smaller changes in other crystal bond lengths. For example, the Cu-O in-plane bond distance changes by only around 2% as does the Hg-O apical bond. The availability of such structural data for this highest transition temperature superconductor may now allow an appraisal of the various structural and electronic factors responsible for superconductivity at such exceptionally high temperatures.

## I Introduction

The recent discoveries of superconductivity in the mercury-bearing cuprates has attracted considerable interest.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] For the homologous series HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{n-1}\)Cu\({}_{n}\)O\({}_{2n+2+\delta}\), this has led to record high superconducting transition temperatures (\(T_{c}\)). For HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) (i.e. \(n=3\)) this temperature is now 135 K at ambient pressure and 164 K under applied pressure.[9] Such remarkable advances illustrate, once again, that the upper limit to \(T_{c}\) in cuprate materials may not yet have been achieved. The structure of HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) (shown in Fig. 1) is based on the complex layer sequence

\[\ldots\,(\mbox{BaO})(\mbox{HgO}_{\delta})(\mbox{BaO})(\mbox{CuO}_{2})\mbox{Ca }(\mbox{CuO}_{2})\mbox{Ca }(\mbox{CuO}_{2})(\mbox{BaO})\,\ldots\]

in which rocksalt blocks of (BaO)(HgO\({}_{\delta}\))(BaO) alternate with oxygen-deficient perovskite-like (CuO\({}_{2}\))Ca(CuO\({}_{2}\)) blocks.

Recent experiments have shown that the transition temperature of HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) increases dramatically with the application of hydrostatic pressure, reaching a maximum value of 164 K at 31 GPa.[7, 8, 9] This represents a record value for \(T_{c}\) in any kind of environment, and a temperature only \(\sim\) 20 K below the lowest recorded ground temperature on this planet. Such high-pressure studies may provide vital information as to the possibility of superconductivity at yet higher temperatures. A major experimental goal would be to simulate such crystal-chemical pressure by appropriate synthesis and chemical substitutions under ambient pressure conditions. With these factors in mind we have undertaken an _in situ_ structural determination of HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) (Hg1223) up to pressures of 8.5 GPa using powder neutron diffraction on the high intensity, medium resolution POLARIS diffractometer at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.[10]

## II Experimental

### Synthesis

Samples of HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) were prepared using the method described in Ref. [11]. A mixed precursor with the nominal composition Ba\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{x}\) was prepared from a

Figure 1: A schematic representation of the structure of HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\).

  stoichiometric mixture of the component nitrates under flowing oxygen at 925 degC for 72 h with three intermediate grindings. A stoichiometric amount of yellow HgO was added to this precursor and the mixture placed in a gold capsule adapted for high pressure synthesis. The sample was pressurized to 1.8 GPa over the course of 20 min and then heated to 880 degC in 40 min. The temperature and pressure were then maintained or 1.6 to 1.8 h before switching the furnace off and decreasing the pressure to ambient over a period of 20 min.

### Magnetic characterization

Superconducting properties were measured using a dc superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Cryogenics Model S100); here the sample vial was lowered into the cryostat and cooled to ~4 K in the absence of any externally generated magnetic field (Fig. 2).

### Neutron diffraction

Time-of-flight powder neutron-diffraction measurements were performed on the high intensity, medium resolution POLARIS diffractometer at the ISIS facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.10 An ambient pressure measurement was made in a cylindrical vanadium can to obtain accurate starting parameters for the refinement of the high-pressure data. Since mercury is a relatively strong absorber (\(\sigma_{a}\) = 372.3 b) these ambient data were corrected for sample attenuation. High-pressure measurements were made using the Paris Edinburgh opposed anvil pressure cell with a sample volume of ~100 mm3. Details of this cell are given elsewhere12 but using tungsten carbide anvils a maximum pressure of around 10.0 GPa can be achieved. High-pressure diffraction data were collected using the detector bands at scattering angles of 82deg < 2 _th_ < 96deg, which gives data over the \(d\) spacing range 0.3 < \(d\) < 4.3 A with a resolution of \(\Delta d/d\) ~ 0.6%. Each data set was collected over a period of 12-15 h. The data were normalized to remove the wavelength dependence of the incident neutron flux and corrected for the effects of attenuation of the incident and scattered beams by components of the pressure cell. Data sets were obtained at applied loads of 20, 65, 85, and 110 tonnes corresponding to approximate pressures of < 0.5, 3.5, 6.0, and 8.5 GPa. Unfortunately constraints of time prevented an equation-of-state experiment from being carried out and these applied pressures have been inferred from the applied load given the known behavior of the pressure cell for similar materials. (Hence the rather large errors shown in the figures.) In an earlier neutron-diffraction study by Hunter _et al._17 one of the impurity phases (CaO) was used as an internal pressure calibration to determine the actual sample pressure. Such an approach cannot be applied here however due to the lack of CaO in our samples. Nevertheless it is possible to use the bulk modulus determined by Hunter _et al._17 in combination with our measured changes in until-cell volume to calibrate our pressure readings. Unfortunately their bulk modulus was determined from only two pressure readings and such a calibration results in a linear dependence of the lattice constants with pressure. This we feel is unreasonable and hence we have continued to use the pressure readings inferred from the applied load.

The ambient pressure structure of Hg1223 was refined using the program TF14LS based on the Cambridge Crystallographic Subroutine Library,13,14 using the model of Chmaissen _et al._ but without splitting the Ba site.11 Scattering lengths of 1.2692, 0.507, 0.476, 0.7718, and 0.5803 (all \(\times 10^{- 12}\) cm) were assigned to Hg, Ba, Ca, and O, respectively.15 A number of reflections arising from impurities in the sample were observed, the most significant of which came from HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{3}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{10 + \delta}\) (Hg1234). Other impurity phases such as "BaCuO\({}_{2}\)" and CaHgO\({}_{2}\) which are present in only small quantities were also included as test of the refinement. In this context we were conscious of the observation of Hunter _et al._17 that the O(3) \(z\) coordinate is sensitive to the treatment of impurity phases. The inclusion of these two minor phases however had no marked effect on the

\begin{table}

In order to simplify our model from four to two phase these minor impurities were not included in subsequent refinement. As a result two phase refinement was performed using the program FORTY1, also based on the Cambridge Crystallographic Subroutine Library. All positional parameters were refined, along with isotropic thermal parameters for all atoms except O(4) in the Hg planes. Thermal parameters for similar sites in Hg1223 and Hg1234 were constrained to be equal.

The high-pressure data was also refined using FORTY1, but in addition to these two phases, parameters for tungsten carbide from the anvils of the pressure cell were refined. Since the number of clearly identifiable peaks in the high-pressure data arising from Hg1234 are small, the \(a\) lattice parameter was constrained to be the same as that of Hg1223. The \(c\) lattice parameter was deduced from the compressibility of Hg1223 with the addition of the compressibility of an additional CaCuO2 unit. An overall temperature factor covering both phases was refined, whilst individual atomic thermal parameters were fixed at the values obtained from the ambient pressure and temperature data. The atomic positional parameters for Hg1223 were varied whilst changes in those for Hg1234 were deduced from those of its three-layer counterpart.

## III Results and Discussion

### Ambient pressure structure

Rietveld analysis of the ambient pressure data converged smoothly for both the single and two-phase refinements. Final refined parameters for both Hg1223 and Hg1234 phases are given in Table 1 and the profile fit to the data is shown in Fig. 3. Note that in Fig. 3 the allowed reflections for Hg1223 are indicated, but the complete profile fit includes both the Hg1223 and Hg1234 phases.

The values for Hg1223 are in good agreement with those of an earlier powder neutron-diffraction study[11] and also a recent single crystal structure determination.[16] These values were used as the starting point for the refinement of the data obtained in the high-pressure cell.

### The effect of pressure

Table 2 shows the refined lattice constants and atomic \(z\) coordinates for Hg1223 under the different loadings. The profile fit for the 8.5 GPa data is shown in Fig. 4.

#### iii.2.1 Cell constants

Figure 5 shows the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the lattice constants of Hg1223. The decrease in both \(a\) and \(c\) is essentially linear with _da_/_dP_~-_ 0.011 A/GPa and _dc_/_dP_~-_ 0.090 A/GPa; with some deviation from linearity at the highest applied pressures; note that the decrease of the \(c\) parameter is ~8 times that of the \(a\) parameter. Hunter _et al._[17] have reported a high-pressure neutron diffraction study of HgBa2CuO4+_d_ (Hg1201), HgBa2CaCu2O6+_d_ (Hg1212), and Hg1223. There are slight differences in the lattice constants from the present work and that of Hunter _et al._ (\(\Delta\)_a_ = 0.0056 A, \(\Delta\)_c_ = 0.0086 A). However, we feel that such small differences are well within the systematic errors limits for two independent studies. Both investigations

#### iii.4.2 Compressibility of cell constants

The compressibility \(\kappa\) of a structural parameter \(m\) is given by \(\kappa_{m}\)= \(-\)(1/_m_)[\(\partial m(P)/\partial P\)]. Hence from the unit-cell data is possible to calculate the compressibility along the \(a\) and \(c\) axes as well as the overall unit-cell volume (\(\kappa_{a}\), \(\kappa_{c}\), and \(\kappa_{v}\), respectively). This in turn yields the bulk modulus (\(B\)) of the structure via the relationship \(B\) = 1/\(\kappa_{v}\). The values of these compressibility parameters are listed in Table 3. In addition to our experimental results of those of Hunter _et al._[17] the results of two theoretical studies on this system are also included.[18, 19]

The results of Cornelius and Schilling[18] are derived using a model based on the ideas of comparative crystal chemistry.[20] Novikov, Mryasov, and Freeman[19] have performed local-density approximation calculations to investigate the effects of pressure on the single CuO\({}_{2}\) layer Hg1201 structure and also the infinite layer (IL) (Sr\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\))\({}_{1-y}\) CuO\({}_{2}\) material. These authors considered the structure of the double, triple, and quadruple CuO\({}_{2}\) layer Hg materials as simple combinations of Hg1201 and IL blocks and subsequently arrives at the figures reported in Table 3.

The anisotropic nature of the compressibility (as expressed by \(\kappa_{c}\)/\(\kappa_{a}\)) is clearly evident from the data given in Table 3. Whilst there is general agreement between the experimentally determined values of \(\kappa_{a}\) and \(\kappa_{c}\), the results from the theoretical models show consistently smaller values of \(\kappa_{c}\). Hence the predicted anisotropy parameter is smaller than the experimentally determined value. It seems clear from these results that dividing the Hg1223 structure into subunits for which compressibility parameters are already known and using these known values to predict the effect of pressure on the three-layer Hg phase is perhaps something of an over simplification. With the availability of data for a number of Hg-containing cuprates, it would now seem appropriate to look in more detail at these calculations.

#### iii.4.3 Bond lengths

The effect of pressure on the individual bond lengths can be seen in Table 4 and the changes in selective Cu-O, Hg-O, and Ba-O bonds are shown in Figs. 6-8, respectively. It should be noted that the variations in Cu(1)-O(1) distances are virtually identical to those of Cu(2)-O(2) and, as such, only the changes in Cu(2)-O(2) are shown in the figure.

At ambient pressure the Cu(2)O(3) apical bond distance is extremely large (2.727 A) and the results of the refinement shows that this decreases by 10.5% (to 2.440 A) on going to 8.5 GPa. Note that this decrease in the Cu(2)-O(3) apical bond corresponds to 38% of the total decrease of the \(c\) lattice constant. Equally impressive is the insensitivity of the Hg-O(3) apical distance to pressure (0.014 A decrease over the same pressure range, 2% of the \(c\)-axis contraction) as this also lies entirely along the \(c\) axis. The picture that emerges is that of a highly compressible Cu(2)-O(3) bond and a virtually incompressible Hg-O(3) bond (see below).

The large compression of the Cu(2)-O(3) apical bond contrasts sharply with the 2.2% decrease (1.926 to 1.883 A) in the Cu(2)-O(2) in-plane distance over the same pressure range. The consistently small changes (2.2-2.4 %) in all the in-plane bonds [Hg-O(4), Cu(1)-O(1), and Cu(2)-O(2)] is the source of the small contraction of the \(a\) lattice parameter (Figs. 6 and 7).

#### 4. Compressibility of chemical bonds

The compressibility of all the bonds listed in Table 4 have been calculated and a selected number of these are shown in Table 5. In addition, data for Hg1201 and Hg1212 (Ref. [17]) have been included. It might be anticipated that under applied pressure cation-anion interaction will have a higher compressibility than anion-anion and cation-cation interactions. An examination of the Hg1223 structure shows that the major cation-anion interactions along the \(c\) axis are the Hg-O(3) and Cu(2)-O(3) bonds, i.e., the cation-apical oxygen bonds. The remaining major interactions are likely to be Cu(2)-Cu(1) cation-cation repulsions but other bonds will, of course, have small components along the \(c\) axis.

Hunter _et al._[17] found that for the single and double CuO\({}_{2}\) layer compounds the Cu-apical O bond has a compressibility greater than \(\kappa_{c}\) but that the Hg-apical O bond is virtually unchanged. In contrast, for the triple CuO\({}_{2}\) layer compound they reported the reverse trend, vis. the Cu(2)-O(3) bond was not strongly compressible. This result is very surprising considering the fact that the Cu(2)-O(3) distance is some 0.7 A longer than the Hg-O(3) bond. In contrast, we find a highly compressible Cu(2)-O(3) bond for HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\) Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\).

Figures 6 and 7 show that applied pressure has very little effect on the Hg-O(3) bond in contrast to a significant contraction of the Cu(2)-O(3) bond. This is consistent with the results[17] from the single and double CuO\({}_{2}\) layer Hg phase and is reflected in the compressibility values given in Table 5 for the various chemical bonds in the single, double, and triple CuO\({}_{2}\) layer mercury cuprates.

## 5 Concluding remarks

The most prominent feature to emerge from these experiments on HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) is the drastic shortening of the apical Cu-O bond with pressure; the Cu(2)-O(3) bond length changes from 2.727 A at ambient pressure to 2.440 A at 8.5 GPa, a change of some 10.5%. Over the same pressure range the Cu(2)-O(2) in-plane distance, for example, decreases by only 2.2% while the Hg-O(3) apical distance reduces also by

  only 2%. The \(da/dP\) and \(dc/dP\) coefficients also illustrate that the crystal compressibility is highly anisotropic.

From a structural point of view, the arrangement of the superconducting and charge reservoir blocks in HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\) Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) are somewhat similar to those found in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\) O\({}_{7+\delta}\).[21] Thus, the structure contains blocks such as (CuO\({}_{2}\))(BaO)(HgO\({}_{\delta}\))(BaO)(CuO\({}_{2}\)) or (CuO\({}_{2}\))(BaO)(CuO\({}_{\delta}\)) (BaO)(CuO\({}_{2}\)) in which (CuO\({}_{2}\)) is the (common) superconducting layer and (HgO\({}_{\delta}\)) and (CuO\({}_{\delta}\)) are the corresponding charge reservoirs. At this stage, it seems reasonable that the very different pressure effects for the Hg-bearing cuprates and YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7+\delta}\) may arise from the differences in the coordination chemistry of the apical oxygens. In YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\) O\({}_{7+\delta}\) the apical is coordinated to two Cu cations, whereas in HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) one finds the apical oxygen bound to a copper cation and a Hg cation. The characteristic dumb bell bond between Hg and O(3) is only 1.980 A at ambient pressure whereas the Cu(2)-O(3) apical bond is exceptionally long at 2.727 A; indeed this Cu-O distance might lead one to question the appellation "chemical bond." This situation almost certainly ensures that the Cu-O-Hg bond is highly compressible while the Cu-O-Cu bond in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7+\delta}\) is only marginally compressible.

It is widely noted that this structural parameter is intimately related to the nature of the electronic band structure of the superconducting cuprates. In particular, the energy level of the apical oxygen ions have been shown to play a fundamental role in the control of the electronic structure of the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes, most notably in governing the maximum value of \(T_{c}\).[22, 23, 24] While the dramatic effect of pressure on \(T_{c}\) and the apical Cu-O bond may be shown to be closely interrelated, it is important to recognize, and take account of, the totality of crystal structure changes under hydrostatic pressure. As just one example, we note that Novikov and Freeman[25] have discussed the influence of Ca ions situated between the CuO\({}_{2}\) layers on the electronic energy bands of these systems. Here an indirect interaction involving Ba (2_p_) states effects the energy of the HgO band. The downward movement of the Hg band charge reservoir electronic band\(-\)and hence the degree of charge transfer-is caused by the subtle interplay between the Ca (4_p_) and Ba (2_p_) states that ultimately govern its location in relation to the Cu (3_d_)-O(2_p_) states.[25] Such features are also highlighted by Rodriguez, Christensen, and Peltzer y Blanca.[26] The present determination of the crystal structure of HgBa\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) at various high pressures may now allow a more complete evaluation of the structural and electronic features responsible for superconductivity at such exceptionally high temperatures.
