###### Abstract

We report the effect of the substitution of the 3d transition metal element Co for Cu on the resistivity, Hall coefficient, and thermopower in the normal state of the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 system over a wide range of carrier concentration. The carrier concentration is varied by partial replacement of Ca by Y ions. The superconducting transition temperature (_T_c_) is found to decrease considerably and a significant enhancement of the thermopower is observed with increasing Co doping. Both _T_c and thermopower show linear dependence on Co concentration. The temperature dependence of the thermopower for the underdoped samples shows a weak anomaly above the broad peak. This anomaly may be assigned to the opening of a normal-state gap in the density of states. A scaling behavior for the normal-state thermopower for optimum and underdoped samples has been established from our studies. We have also shown that the thermopower of all underdoped cuprates can be scaled into a single universal functional form. [S0163-1829(99)09325-X]

## I Introduction

It is well established that the normal-state transport properties of high-temperature superconductors are profoundly different from those of conventional metals and superconductors. The understanding of this unusual normal state is an important step to elucidate the superconducting mechanism in the high-_T_c systems. The strongly correlated charge dynamics in the two-dimensional CuO2 network is the origin of many anomalous transport properties and high superconducting transition temperatures. Several effects due to strong electronic correlation are usually manifested in materials with reduced carrier density, commonly known as underdoped. The universal doping-temperature phase diagram of the cuprates shows the proximity of magnetic ordering, metallic, and superconducting phases, and suggests that they are interrelated. The undoped parent compounds are usually antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott-Hubbard insulators. With increasing carrier doping, magnetic fluctuations suppress long-range ordering and superconductivity evolves in the proximity of the insulator-to-metal (IM) transition. Therefore, the evolution of the metallic phase from the AF insulating phase has received much attention. Recently, a new phenomenon has been discovered in underdoped samples. A gaplike feature in the electronic spectrum of low-energy excitations have been inferred from neutron difraction,[1] NMR,[2] specific heat,[3] electrical[4] and optical[5] conductivity, thermopower,[6] and Raman spectroscopy.[7] In fact all transport properties of high-_T_c superconductors exhibit a systematic dependence on hole concentration including, most notably, the thermopower. The thermopower is a simple but highly sensitive tool to detect any changes in the electronic transport mechanism due to small variations of carrier density or disorder in the CuO2 plane.

In this paper, we report the charge transport characteristics of the Co-doped Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_xCu2O8 system with controlled carrier density from highly underdoped to slightly overdoped. In the YBa2Cu3O7 system, Zn and Ni occupy Cu sites in the CuO2 plane whereas Co and Fe go into the CuO chain site and decrease carrier density. However, in the Bi2212 system Co goes into the CuO2 plane without affecting the carrier density. In YBa2Cu3O7 (Ref. 6), YBa2Cu4O8 (Ref. 6), and La22-_x_Sr_x_CuO4 (Ref. 8) systems, thermopower decreases systematically with the doping of Zn and Ni and a clear indication of the normal-state gap opening and its suppression with Zn doping have been reflected in the temperature dependence of the thermopower of the underdoped samples. In the present study, our aim is to investigate whether similar behavior also exists in the Co-doped Bi2212 system.

## II Experimental techniques

Polycrystalline samples of nominal composition Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_x(Cu1-_y_Co_y_)2O8 were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of oxides and carbonates were mixed throughly and then reacted in air for several days with intermediate grindings. The heat treatment temperature was increased linearly with x from 860 to 900 degC as Y concentration increases from 0 to 1.0. The x-ray diffraction patterns show that all the samples are single phase having orthorhombic structure. The systematic change of lattice parameters and other physical properties with increasing Co concentration suggest that Co is incorporated in the lattice. The variation of lattice parameters are consistent with the reported results.[9] Energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence analysis was used to estimate the Co concentration in the samples. The photopeak integrals of Cu and Co K lines were obtained with a standard peak fitting program. The concentrations of Cu and Co in the samples were then calculated using the fundamental parameter technique [Eq. (1) of Ref. 10] where the effect of absorption of x rays in the sample as well as in the air gap and the enhancement of the Co K x ray by Cu K x rays were taken into account.[11] The estimated values of y are within 15% of the nominal compositions. The thermopower of the samples has been measured using a differential technique where a small temperature gradient is created across the sample and the voltage developed between the hot and cold junctions of the thermocouple formed by the sample and Cu wires is mea sured. The details of the setup and measurement technique have been reported earlier.[12] The electrical resistivity has been measured by dc four probe method. The Hall coefficient measurements have been done at room temperature under the magnetic field of 20 kOe. The magnetic field was reversed to eliminate any magnetoresistance. The average of four to five sets of data were taken to calculate the Hall coefficient for each sample.

## III Results and discussions

The effect of Co doping on the temperature dependence of the resistivity and superconducting transition temperature of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}(Cu_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}O_{8} is shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) for two batches of samples with x = 0 and 0.3. Both the conductivity and T_{c} are observed to decrease with increasing Co concentration. The midpoint of the superconducting transition in the \rho vs T plot is defined as T_{c} here. T_{c} determined in this way is very close to the temperature at which dp/dT is maximum. For x = 0, all the samples are metallic and superconducting. The \rho vs T of Co-rich samples shows a small upturn or semiconductible behavior for higher Y content samples. The x dependence of T_{c} for the undoped (y = 0) samples is as reported in the literature.[13, 14] The variation of T_{c} as a function of y is shown in Fig. 1(c) for samples with different x. From the figure, it is clear that T_{c} decreases linearly with Co doping. From the figure we can see that the slope of T_{c} vs y curves, i.e., the rate of T_{c} suppression with Co doping, is a function of the Y concentration. The slope increases with increasing Y content. This suggests that the T_{c} suppression is stronger in the underdoped regime.

There are various ways to explain the T_{c} suppression by magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities. In the framework of conventional Abrikosov-Gorkov (AG) theory, it can be interpreted as the incorporation of magnetic impurities into a superconductor. However, in CaBa-123 (Ref. [15]) magnetic (Ni) and nonmagnetic impurity (Zn) depress T_{c} with equal effectiveness. Sun and Maki[16] studied the impurity effect in d-wave superconductors and found that the T_{c} reduction for elastic scattering in weak-coupling d-wave superconductors follows the AG equation. Tallon,[17] using the AG equation, analyzed the experimental results of different high-T_{c} systems and found that the initial slope of the depression in T_{c} with impurity concentration (dT_{c}/dy) is constant for overdoped samples where the pseudogap is absent and rises rapidly in the underdoped region with the appearence of the pseudogap. Our present findings that show dT_{c}/dy is stronger in the underdoped region and weaker in the overdoped region are in conformity with their observations and analysis.

The thermopower S for samples with different x and y are plotted against temperature in Fig. 2. For the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} (x = 0 and y = 0) sample, S is negative from 310 K down to T_{c} , and decreases linearly with increasing T. S increases systematically with increasing impurity (y) concentration but remains mostly negative and maintains its linear dependence on T up to the highest doping level of Co. The following clear characteristics are observed in the S vs T curve with increasing Y doping (x): (1) S changes from negative to positive and becomes nonlinear in T, (2) a broad peak appears and this peak shifts towards higher temperatures, (3) a small anomaly appears slightly above the peak in the S vs T curve for x\geq 0.3 samples (clearly depicted in Fig. 3). The small, negative and linear T dependence of S in the overdoped regime is consistent with the metallic nature of the resistivity. It has been pointed out[6] that the appearance of the broad peak in the S-T curve with increasing x (decreasing carrier density) is due to the opening of a gap in the normal state termed the "pseudogap" or "'spin gap." The rapid

  decrease of S below this peak is also due to the opening of this gap. In the Zn-substituted YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} samples, this broad peak is suppressed considerably and the thermopower is enhanced at low temperatures well below the peak.[6] The disorder introduced in the CuO_{2} plane by the random distribution of Zn ions suppresses the gap. The temperature at which S of Zn-doped samples deviates from the undoped one has been assigned as the gap-opening temperature. In the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system too, thermopower decreases considerably with Zn and Ni doping.[8] This behavior is seen in the underdoped as well as in the highly overdoped samples. Sera _et al.[8]_ proposed that S consists of two parts: a T-linear part and an anomalous part. The linear term is usual and ascribed to electron diffusion in metals while the anomalous term is due to the spin fluctuations or spin correlation. They suggested that the decrease of S by Zn substitution is due to the decrease of the anomalous spin fluctuation term. However, the thermopower of Bi-2212 system shows a different kind of behavior with Co doping. S is observed to increase monotonically with Co concentration up to the highest value of y and shows a broad peak for optimum and underdoped samples. Also, we have not seen any enhance

  ment of S below the peak in the Co-substituted samples as observed in Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [6]). Except for a small shift in the peak towards the higher temperature, the nature of the T dependence of S for the Co-doped samples is similar to that of undoped samples. The above unusual behavior of S with Co doping cannot be ascribed to a decrease in the carrier density. Maeda _et al._[18] measured the Hall coefficient of Zn-, Ni-, Co-, and Fe-doped Bi-2212 and did not observe any decrease in the carrier density. In fact, their results show a small decrease in the Hall coefficient for Fe-doped samples as compared to the undoped one. We have also measured the Hall coefficient at room temperature for an x\!=\!0.4 sample for different Co concentrations and observed that R_{H} does not depend on the impurity concentration. Thus the increase of S with Co doping must have a different origin.

In Fig. 3, we show the temperature dependence of S for the underdoped samples (x\!\geq\!0.3) with y\!=\!0. Above the peak, thermopower shows a small anomaly below a characteristic temperature (T_{S}^{\Phi}). This feature was reproduced in several measurements. It may be noted that Co-doped samples with different x also show a similar anomaly above the peak. As has already been discussed, the broad peak in S arises due to the opening of the normal-state gap. The temperature T_{S}^{\Phi} below which S shows anomaly is assigned to the gap opening temperature. A deviation from the linear resistivity [19, 20] behavior below a certain temperature and a small anomaly in the thermopower [20] close to this temperature has been observed for oxygen deficient Bi-2212 samples. It has been suggested that the normal state gap opens below this temperature. [19, 20] The gap opening temperatures T_{S}^{\Phi} are 179, 196, 203, 230, and 258 K, respectively, for our samples with x\!=\!0.3, 0.4, 0.42, 0.44, and 0.46. These temperatures (T_{S}^{\Phi}) are comparable with those reported by others for samples with similar T_{c} and doping level. [5, 7, 19, 20]

Due to the complicated temperature dependence of thermopower in high-T_{c} superconductors, it is difficult to determine the carrier density or other normal-state parameters related to electron transport in these systems. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the temperature dependence of S but at this moment it is hard to judge which one is best to describe the thermopower of high-T_{c} materials. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to find whether any correlation between the thermopower and other physical parameters such as carrier density, T_{c}, etc., exists. [21, 22, 23] With the variation of carrier level, a strong dependence of T_{c} on room-temperature thermopower (S_{300\ \rm{k}}) similar to that of T_{c} vs carrier density has been observed in different systems. To observe whether the Co-doped Bi-2212 system shows a similar behavior we have plotted S_{300\ \rm{k}} as a function of T_{c} and Co concentration in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a) shows that for a given Y concentration, T_{c} decreases linearly with S_{300\ \rm{K}}. This behavior is quite different from that of parabolic dependence of T_{c} on S_{300\ \rm{K}} in oxygen deficient systems [21] where T_{c} is suppressed due to the decrease of carrier density. Thus the effects of T_{c} suppression on normal-state thermopower due to the disorder in the CuO_{2} plane and due to changes in carrier density are different in nature. It is clear from the Fig. 4(b) that S_{300\ \rm{K}} increases linearly with Co concentration for samples with x\!<\!0.50. For x\!=\!0.5 sample, a strong deviation from linear behavior is observed. It may be mentioned that the x\!=\!0.5 doping is close to the metal-to-insulator transition in this system. This suggests that the in

For x\!=\!0.30 sample, S has been shifted upward by 8.5 \muV/K. The arrows indicate the appearance of a weak anomaly due to the opening of the normal-state gap.

  fluence of Co substitution on S is different in the metallic and in the insulating regimes.

The various normal-state transport parameters of high-_T__c_ superconductors can be scaled to universal master curves. Uchida4 showed that the in-plane resistivity of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ deviates from linear behavior below a characteristic temperature T_{n} well above the T_{c} and observed that all the r_{b} vs T plots for underdoped samples including HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+_y_ fall into a single curve by scaling _T__T__n_ and r_{b}(_T_)/_r__ab_(T_{n}). Hwang _et al._24 found that the Hall coefficient R_{H}(_T_) of La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 can be scaled to a universal functional form R_{H}(_T_) = R_{H} + R_{H}(_T_/_T__H_). R_{H}(_T_) is temperature dependent below a characteristic temperature T_{H} and becomes T independent (R_{H}) above T_{H}. The temperature T_{H} is found close to the characteristic temperatures where the susceptibility and the Knight shift show peaks. As in the other cases, T_{H} is also found to increase with the depletion of carrier density. For the Y-123 system, similar type of scaling behavior for the Hall coefficient is confirmed by Chen _et al._25 They observed that the characteristic temperatures T_{n} and T_{H} are close to each other. So far the scaling has been done on materials with finite T_{c} and the physical properties considered mainly resistivity and Hall coefficient. Mandal _et al._22 established a scaling of thermopower for the nonsuperconducting Bi-2212 and Tl-2212 samples. They observed that the S vs T plots for the nonsuperconducting samples fall into a single curve by scaling _S_(_T_)/_S_* and _T_/_T_* as in the case of resistivity. Here, _T__*_ is the temperature where S shows its maximum value _S__*_. Similar scaling behavior for S has also been reported recently by Cooper and Loram23 for La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 and YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ systems. They observed that the temperature (T_{n}) where _kh_ shows maximum is approximately two times higher than that of _T__*_. To investigate whether a similar type of scaling is also applicable for Co-doped samples we have plotted _S_/_S__*_ vs _T_/_T_* in Fig. 5. It is clear that all the S vs T plots for superconducting as well as nonsuperconducting samples of Fig. 2 which show broad peaks can be scaled to a single curve. For some superconducting samples, the low-temperature data deviate and are not plotted in this figure. This is due to the high superconducting onset temperature which is closer to the peak as compared to other samples.

It has been observed4 that the opening of the pseudogap strongly modifies the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity below _T__n_'. r_{b} remains linear above _T__n_' but follows _T__2.5 dependence below _T__n_'. This behavior is universal for all underdoped cuprates. This suggests that the resistivity for all the underdoped cuprates can be scaled into a single universal curve after subtracting the residual resistivity.4 Now the question arises of whether a similar type of universal scaling also exists for other transport coefficients. For this we have plotted the thermopower data for Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 (Tl-2212) (Ref. 26), La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 (LSCO) (Ref. 23), and YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (YBCO) (Ref. 23) systems in Fig. 5. One can see that all the curves for different systems fall onto a single curve. For the La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 system, the small deviation may be due to the scattering of experimental data.23 Thus as in the case of resistivity and Hall coefficient, one can scale thermopower also into a single universal curve of the form _S_/_S__*_ = _f_(_T_/_T_*). As S is zero at T = 0, the function _f_(_T_/_T_*) should also vanish at T = 0. The inset of Fig. 5 shows the variation of _T_* and _S_* with Y concentration (carrier density). The nature of variation of these two parameters with carrier density are qualitatively similar to that for the La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 (Refs. 23,24) and YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (Ref. 23) systems.

In summary, we have investigated the normal-state transport properties of Co-doped Bi-2212 system over a wide range of carrier concentration by means of resistivity, thermopower, and Hall coefficient. Our studies reveal the following. (1) T_{c} decreases linearly with increasing Co impurity. (2) In the optimum and underdoped regimes, S vs T shows a weak anomaly above the broad peak associated with the normal-state gap opening phenomenon. The gap opening temperatures obtained from the thermopower measurements are close to those reported from other measurements. (3) Thermopower increases monotonically with Co doping and the room-temperature thermopower for x < 0.5 samples shows a linear dependence on Co concentration. For the x = 0.5 sample, S increases with Co at a rate much faster than linear. (4) All the S vs T plots showing broad peaks fall into a single curve by scaling _T_/_T__n_' and _S_(_T_)/_S__*_. (5) As with the resistivity the thermopower of underdoped cuprates can be scaled into a single functional form.

###### Abstract

We report the effect of the substitution of the 3d transition metal element Co for Cu on the resistivity, Hall coefficient, and thermopower in the normal state of the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 system over a wide range of carrier concentration. The carrier concentration is varied by partial replacement of Ca by Y ions. The superconducting transition temperature (_T_c_) is found to decrease considerably and a significant enhancement of the thermopower is observed with increasing Co doping. Both _T_c and thermopower show linear dependence on Co concentration. The temperature dependence of the thermopower for the underdoped samples shows a weak anomaly above the broad peak. This anomaly may be assigned to the opening of a normal-state gap in the density of states. A scaling behavior for the normal-state thermopower for optimum and underdoped samples has been established from our studies. We have also shown that the thermopower of all underdoped cuprates can be scaled into a single universal functional form. [S0163-1829(99)09325-X]

## I Introduction

It is well established that the normal-state transport properties of high-temperature superconductors are profoundly different from those of conventional metals and superconductors. The understanding of this unusual normal state is an important step to elucidate the superconducting mechanism in the high-_T_c systems. The strongly correlated charge dynamics in the two-dimensional CuO2 network is the origin of many anomalous transport properties and high superconducting transition temperatures. Several effects due to strong electronic correlation are usually manifested in materials with reduced carrier density, commonly known as underdoped. The universal doping-temperature phase diagram of the cuprates shows the proximity of magnetic ordering, metallic, and superconducting phases, and suggests that they are interrelated. The undoped parent compounds are usually antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott-Hubbard insulators. With increasing carrier doping, magnetic fluctuations suppress long-range ordering and superconductivity evolves in the proximity of the insulator-to-metal (IM) transition. Therefore, the evolution of the metallic phase from the AF insulating phase has received much attention. Recently, a new phenomenon has been discovered in underdoped samples. A gaplike feature in the electronic spectrum of low-energy excitations have been inferred from neutron difraction,[1] NMR,[2] specific heat,[3] electrical[4] and optical[5] conductivity, thermopower,[6] and Raman spectroscopy.[7] In fact all transport properties of high-_T_c superconductors exhibit a systematic dependence on hole concentration including, most notably, the thermopower. The thermopower is a simple but highly sensitive tool to detect any changes in the electronic transport mechanism due to small variations of carrier density or disorder in the CuO2 plane.

In this paper, we report the charge transport characteristics of the Co-doped Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_xCu2O8 system with controlled carrier density from highly underdoped to slightly overdoped. In the YBa2Cu3O7 system, Zn and Ni occupy Cu sites in the CuO2 plane whereas Co and Fe go into the CuO chain site and decrease carrier density. However, in the Bi2212 system Co goes into the CuO2 plane without affecting the carrier density. In YBa2Cu3O7 (Ref. 6), YBa2Cu4O8 (Ref. 6), and La22-_x_Sr_x_CuO4 (Ref. 8) systems, thermopower decreases systematically with the doping of Zn and Ni and a clear indication of the normal-state gap opening and its suppression with Zn doping have been reflected in the temperature dependence of the thermopower of the underdoped samples. In the present study, our aim is to investigate whether similar behavior also exists in the Co-doped Bi2212 system.

## II Experimental techniques

Polycrystalline samples of nominal composition Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_x(Cu1-_y_Co_y_)2O8 were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of oxides and carbonates were mixed throughly and then reacted in air for several days with intermediate grindings. The heat treatment temperature was increased linearly with x from 860 to 900 degC as Y concentration increases from 0 to 1.0. The x-ray diffraction patterns show that all the samples are single phase having orthorhombic structure. The systematic change of lattice parameters and other physical properties with increasing Co concentration suggest that Co is incorporated in the lattice. The variation of lattice parameters are consistent with the reported results.[9] Energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence analysis was used to estimate the Co concentration in the samples. The photopeak integrals of Cu and Co K lines were obtained with a standard peak fitting program. The concentrations of Cu and Co in the samples were then calculated using the fundamental parameter technique [Eq. (1) of Ref. 10] where the effect of absorption of x rays in the sample as well as in the air gap and the enhancement of the Co K x ray by Cu K x rays were taken into account.[11] The estimated values of y are within 15% of the nominal compositions. The thermopower of the samples has been measured using a differential technique where a small temperature gradient is created across the sample and the voltage developed between the hot and cold junctions of the thermocouple formed by the sample and Cu wires is mea sured. The details of the setup and measurement technique have been reported earlier.[12] The electrical resistivity has been measured by dc four probe method. The Hall coefficient measurements have been done at room temperature under the magnetic field of 20 kOe. The magnetic field was reversed to eliminate any magnetoresistance. The average of four to five sets of data were taken to calculate the Hall coefficient for each sample.

## III Results and discussions

The effect of Co doping on the temperature dependence of the resistivity and superconducting transition temperature of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Y_{x}(Cu_{1-y}Co_{y})_{2}O_{8} is shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) for two batches of samples with x = 0 and 0.3. Both the conductivity and T_{c} are observed to decrease with increasing Co concentration. The midpoint of the superconducting transition in the \rho vs T plot is defined as T_{c} here. T_{c} determined in this way is very close to the temperature at which dp/dT is maximum. For x = 0, all the samples are metallic and superconducting. The \rho vs T of Co-rich samples shows a small upturn or semiconductible behavior for higher Y content samples. The x dependence of T_{c} for the undoped (y = 0) samples is as reported in the literature.[13, 14] The variation of T_{c} as a function of y is shown in Fig. 1(c) for samples with different x. From the figure, it is clear that T_{c} decreases linearly with Co doping. From the figure we can see that the slope of T_{c} vs y curves, i.e., the rate of T_{c} suppression with Co doping, is a function of the Y concentration. The slope increases with increasing Y content. This suggests that the T_{c} suppression is stronger in the underdoped regime.

There are various ways to explain the T_{c} suppression by magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities. In the framework of conventional Abrikosov-Gorkov (AG) theory, it can be interpreted as the incorporation of magnetic impurities into a superconductor. However, in CaBa-123 (Ref. [15]) magnetic (Ni) and nonmagnetic impurity (Zn) depress T_{c} with equal effectiveness. Sun and Maki[16] studied the impurity effect in d-wave superconductors and found that the T_{c} reduction for elastic scattering in weak-coupling d-wave superconductors follows the AG equation. Tallon,[17] using the AG equation, analyzed the experimental results of different high-T_{c} systems and found that the initial slope of the depression in T_{c} with impurity concentration (dT_{c}/dy) is constant for overdoped samples where the pseudogap is absent and rises rapidly in the underdoped region with the appearence of the pseudogap. Our present findings that show dT_{c}/dy is stronger in the underdoped region and weaker in the overdoped region are in conformity with their observations and analysis.

The thermopower S for samples with different x and y are plotted against temperature in Fig. 2. For the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} (x = 0 and y = 0) sample, S is negative from 310 K down to T_{c} , and decreases linearly with increasing T. S increases systematically with increasing impurity (y) concentration but remains mostly negative and maintains its linear dependence on T up to the highest doping level of Co. The following clear characteristics are observed in the S vs T curve with increasing Y doping (x): (1) S changes from negative to positive and becomes nonlinear in T, (2) a broad peak appears and this peak shifts towards higher temperatures, (3) a small anomaly appears slightly above the peak in the S vs T curve for x\geq 0.3 samples (clearly depicted in Fig. 3). The small, negative and linear T dependence of S in the overdoped regime is consistent with the metallic nature of the resistivity. It has been pointed out[6] that the appearance of the broad peak in the S-T curve with increasing x (decreasing carrier density) is due to the opening of a gap in the normal state termed the "pseudogap" or "'spin gap." The rapid

  decrease of S below this peak is also due to the opening of this gap. In the Zn-substituted YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} samples, this broad peak is suppressed considerably and the thermopower is enhanced at low temperatures well below the peak.[6] The disorder introduced in the CuO_{2} plane by the random distribution of Zn ions suppresses the gap. The temperature at which S of Zn-doped samples deviates from the undoped one has been assigned as the gap-opening temperature. In the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} system too, thermopower decreases considerably with Zn and Ni doping.[8] This behavior is seen in the underdoped as well as in the highly overdoped samples. Sera _et al.[8]_ proposed that S consists of two parts: a T-linear part and an anomalous part. The linear term is usual and ascribed to electron diffusion in metals while the anomalous term is due to the spin fluctuations or spin correlation. They suggested that the decrease of S by Zn substitution is due to the decrease of the anomalous spin fluctuation term. However, the thermopower of Bi-2212 system shows a different kind of behavior with Co doping. S is observed to increase monotonically with Co concentration up to the highest value of y and shows a broad peak for optimum and underdoped samples. Also, we have not seen any enhance

  ment of S below the peak in the Co-substituted samples as observed in Zn-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [6]). Except for a small shift in the peak towards the higher temperature, the nature of the T dependence of S for the Co-doped samples is similar to that of undoped samples. The above unusual behavior of S with Co doping cannot be ascribed to a decrease in the carrier density. Maeda _et al._[18] measured the Hall coefficient of Zn-, Ni-, Co-, and Fe-doped Bi-2212 and did not observe any decrease in the carrier density. In fact, their results show a small decrease in the Hall coefficient for Fe-doped samples as compared to the undoped one. We have also measured the Hall coefficient at room temperature for an x\!=\!0.4 sample for different Co concentrations and observed that R_{H} does not depend on the impurity concentration. Thus the increase of S with Co doping must have a different origin.

In Fig. 3, we show the temperature dependence of S for the underdoped samples (x\!\geq\!0.3) with y\!=\!0. Above the peak, thermopower shows a small anomaly below a characteristic temperature (T_{S}^{\Phi}). This feature was reproduced in several measurements. It may be noted that Co-doped samples with different x also show a similar anomaly above the peak. As has already been discussed, the broad peak in S arises due to the opening of the normal-state gap. The temperature T_{S}^{\Phi} below which S shows anomaly is assigned to the gap opening temperature. A deviation from the linear resistivity [19, 20] behavior below a certain temperature and a small anomaly in the thermopower [20] close to this temperature has been observed for oxygen deficient Bi-2212 samples. It has been suggested that the normal state gap opens below this temperature. [19, 20] The gap opening temperatures T_{S}^{\Phi} are 179, 196, 203, 230, and 258 K, respectively, for our samples with x\!=\!0.3, 0.4, 0.42, 0.44, and 0.46. These temperatures (T_{S}^{\Phi}) are comparable with those reported by others for samples with similar T_{c} and doping level. [5, 7, 19, 20]

Due to the complicated temperature dependence of thermopower in high-T_{c} superconductors, it is difficult to determine the carrier density or other normal-state parameters related to electron transport in these systems. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the temperature dependence of S but at this moment it is hard to judge which one is best to describe the thermopower of high-T_{c} materials. Nevertheless, efforts have been made to find whether any correlation between the thermopower and other physical parameters such as carrier density, T_{c}, etc., exists. [21, 22, 23] With the variation of carrier level, a strong dependence of T_{c} on room-temperature thermopower (S_{300\ \rm{k}}) similar to that of T_{c} vs carrier density has been observed in different systems. To observe whether the Co-doped Bi-2212 system shows a similar behavior we have plotted S_{300\ \rm{k}} as a function of T_{c} and Co concentration in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a) shows that for a given Y concentration, T_{c} decreases linearly with S_{300\ \rm{K}}. This behavior is quite different from that of parabolic dependence of T_{c} on S_{300\ \rm{K}} in oxygen deficient systems [21] where T_{c} is suppressed due to the decrease of carrier density. Thus the effects of T_{c} suppression on normal-state thermopower due to the disorder in the CuO_{2} plane and due to changes in carrier density are different in nature. It is clear from the Fig. 4(b) that S_{300\ \rm{K}} increases linearly with Co concentration for samples with x\!<\!0.50. For x\!=\!0.5 sample, a strong deviation from linear behavior is observed. It may be mentioned that the x\!=\!0.5 doping is close to the metal-to-insulator transition in this system. This suggests that the in

For x\!=\!0.30 sample, S has been shifted upward by 8.5 \muV/K. The arrows indicate the appearance of a weak anomaly due to the opening of the normal-state gap.

  fluence of Co substitution on S is different in the metallic and in the insulating regimes.

The various normal-state transport parameters of high-_T__c_ superconductors can be scaled to universal master curves. Uchida4 showed that the in-plane resistivity of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ deviates from linear behavior below a characteristic temperature T_{n} well above the T_{c} and observed that all the r_{b} vs T plots for underdoped samples including HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+_y_ fall into a single curve by scaling _T__T__n_ and r_{b}(_T_)/_r__ab_(T_{n}). Hwang _et al._24 found that the Hall coefficient R_{H}(_T_) of La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 can be scaled to a universal functional form R_{H}(_T_) = R_{H} + R_{H}(_T_/_T__H_). R_{H}(_T_) is temperature dependent below a characteristic temperature T_{H} and becomes T independent (R_{H}) above T_{H}. The temperature T_{H} is found close to the characteristic temperatures where the susceptibility and the Knight shift show peaks. As in the other cases, T_{H} is also found to increase with the depletion of carrier density. For the Y-123 system, similar type of scaling behavior for the Hall coefficient is confirmed by Chen _et al._25 They observed that the characteristic temperatures T_{n} and T_{H} are close to each other. So far the scaling has been done on materials with finite T_{c} and the physical properties considered mainly resistivity and Hall coefficient. Mandal _et al._22 established a scaling of thermopower for the nonsuperconducting Bi-2212 and Tl-2212 samples. They observed that the S vs T plots for the nonsuperconducting samples fall into a single curve by scaling _S_(_T_)/_S_* and _T_/_T_* as in the case of resistivity. Here, _T__*_ is the temperature where S shows its maximum value _S__*_. Similar scaling behavior for S has also been reported recently by Cooper and Loram23 for La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 and YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ systems. They observed that the temperature (T_{n}) where _kh_ shows maximum is approximately two times higher than that of _T__*_. To investigate whether a similar type of scaling is also applicable for Co-doped samples we have plotted _S_/_S__*_ vs _T_/_T_* in Fig. 5. It is clear that all the S vs T plots for superconducting as well as nonsuperconducting samples of Fig. 2 which show broad peaks can be scaled to a single curve. For some superconducting samples, the low-temperature data deviate and are not plotted in this figure. This is due to the high superconducting onset temperature which is closer to the peak as compared to other samples.

It has been observed4 that the opening of the pseudogap strongly modifies the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity below _T__n_'. r_{b} remains linear above _T__n_' but follows _T__2.5 dependence below _T__n_'. This behavior is universal for all underdoped cuprates. This suggests that the resistivity for all the underdoped cuprates can be scaled into a single universal curve after subtracting the residual resistivity.4 Now the question arises of whether a similar type of universal scaling also exists for other transport coefficients. For this we have plotted the thermopower data for Tl2Ba2CaCu2O8 (Tl-2212) (Ref. 26), La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 (LSCO) (Ref. 23), and YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (YBCO) (Ref. 23) systems in Fig. 5. One can see that all the curves for different systems fall onto a single curve. For the La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 system, the small deviation may be due to the scattering of experimental data.23 Thus as in the case of resistivity and Hall coefficient, one can scale thermopower also into a single universal curve of the form _S_/_S__*_ = _f_(_T_/_T_*). As S is zero at T = 0, the function _f_(_T_/_T_*) should also vanish at T = 0. The inset of Fig. 5 shows the variation of _T_* and _S_* with Y concentration (carrier density). The nature of variation of these two parameters with carrier density are qualitatively similar to that for the La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 (Refs. 23,24) and YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (Ref. 23) systems.

In summary, we have investigated the normal-state transport properties of Co-doped Bi-2212 system over a wide range of carrier concentration by means of resistivity, thermopower, and Hall coefficient. Our studies reveal the following. (1) T_{c} decreases linearly with increasing Co impurity. (2) In the optimum and underdoped regimes, S vs T shows a weak anomaly above the broad peak associated with the normal-state gap opening phenomenon. The gap opening temperatures obtained from the thermopower measurements are close to those reported from other measurements. (3) Thermopower increases monotonically with Co doping and the room-temperature thermopower for x < 0.5 samples shows a linear dependence on Co concentration. For the x = 0.5 sample, S increases with Co at a rate much faster than linear. (4) All the S vs T plots showing broad peaks fall into a single curve by scaling _T_/_T__n_' and _S_(_T_)/_S__*_. (5) As with the resistivity the thermopower of underdoped cuprates can be scaled into a single functional form.
