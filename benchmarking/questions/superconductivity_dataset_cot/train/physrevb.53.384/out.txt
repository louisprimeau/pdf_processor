###### Abstract

The specific heats of Nb3S4, Nb3Se4, and Nb3Te4 were measured in the temperature range from 0.5 to 30 K. The magnitude of the jump at the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} was 1.11 +- 0.02 _gT__c_ for Nb3S4 and 0.66 +- 0.01 _gT__c_ for Nb3Se4. The superconducting property for both compounds is discussed on the basis of the weak-coupling BCS theory as extended by Clem to include the effects of energy-gap anisotropy. We estimated the mean-squared anisotropy \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.07 +- 0.02 and the reduced-energy gap 2_e__f_(_k__B__T_) = 3.1 +- 0.1 for Nb3S4, and \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.14 +- 0.03 and 2_e__g_/(_k__B__T_) = 2.8 +- 0.1 for Nb3Se4. For Nb3Te4, although it becomes superconducting at about 2 K in the electrical-resistivity measurement, an excess of specific heat due to the superconducting transition was not found down to about 0.5 K. We also discuss the superconducting property of Nb3Te4.

## I Introduction

A number of transition-metal chalcogenides crystallizes in fiber structures [1] which become superconducting at low temperatures [2,3] or undergo phase transitions due to charge-density-wave (CDW) formation. Owing to the characteristic behavior of CDW's, the properties on charge-density waves have been studied intensively [4]. However, there has been little reliable information on the thermodynamic properties of those superconductors. This is because only small single crystals are available and their superconducting transition temperatures are much lower than those of usual superconductors. Niobium chalcogenide Nb3X4 with X = S, Se, and Te is one of those kinds of superconductors and has a moderate high transition temperature [5]. These compounds are, therefore, suitable matters for studying the thermodynamic properties in the superconducting states.

The crystal structures of Nb3X4 are isomorphous with each other and belong to a hexagonal crystal system [6, 7, 8]. The unit cells contain six niobium atoms and eight chalcogens. Each niobium is surrounded by six chalcogens at the corner of a deformed octahedron consisted of Nb3C6. The niobium atoms are shifted from the centers of the octahedra in the direction of faces sharing two edges with other octahedra. Hence zigzag Nb-Nb chains are formed along the c axis. The Nb-Nb distances in the chains (_d_1 = 2.881, 2.885, and 2.973 A for X = S, Se, and Te) are comparable to the corresponding value in niobium metal (2.859 A), while the shortest Nb-Nb distances d1 between Nb chains are 3.369, 3.567, and 3.854 A for X = S, Se, and Te. The ratios of d1 d1 are 1.169, 1.236, and 1.298 in the above order. Hence the anisotropy of the crystal structures increases according to the above order. This large anisotropy leads to weak coupling. Another remarkable feature of the Nb3X4 structure is the presence of large infinite void channels along the c axis.

Reflecting the above-mentioned characteristic of the crystal structure, Nb3X4 shows high anisotropy in the electrical properties such as resistivity [9] and critical field [10, 11, 12]. Furthermore, the electrical resistivity in both Nb3S4 (Ref. [9]) and Nb3Se4 (Ref. [11]) follows a T3 form below about 80 K which can be explained by the umklapp scattering process in the quasi-one-dimensional band structure [13]. The thermoelectric power and resistivity of Nb3Te4 show two anomalies at about 20 and 80 K [14]. The anomaly at 80 K is due to a charge-density-wave formation with commensurate-wave vectors [15,16]. However, a superlattice corresponding to the anomaly at 20 K has not been observed yet. The specific heat of Nb3S4 has been measured by Biberacher and Schwenk [10]. In addition, the thermodynamic properties in the superconducting state of Nb3S4 have been studied in detail by Okamoto and Ishihara [17]. These properties also show high anisotropies and follow the weak-coupling BCS theory included the effects of an energy-gap anisotropy.

Associated with Nb3X4, owing to the presence of three Nb chains in the unit cell, there exist three conduction bands and corresponding three Fermi surfaces. A calculation of the energy-band structure for Nb3X4 has been made in detail by Oshiyama using the linear-combination-of-atomic-orbital method [13,18]. The calculated Fermi surfaces are reflected the quasi-one-dimensional crystal structures of those crystals: These Fermi surfaces consist of warped planelike sheets. The bandwidths along the chain direction are highly dispersive and are in the range of 1.5-2.5 eV, while those along the interchain directions are quite flat and are of the order of 0.1 eV. The ratios of the conduction-band width along the chain direction to that along the perpendicular direction are 15, 18, and 19 for Nb3S4, Nb3Se4, and Nb3Te4. Bullet [19] and Canadell and Whangbo [20] have also obtained similar results for the band structure of Nb3S4 using an atomic-orbital method and a tight-binding method.

In this paper we report the specific heats on Nb3S4, Nb3Se4, and Nb3Te4 in the temperature range from 0.5 to 30 K. In an earlier work, two of us, on Nb3S4, measured the specific heat in the temperature range from 1.4 to 7 K and obtained the thermodynamic parameters for the superconducting property [17]. The purpose of this work is to measure systematically the specific heat to determine the thermodynamic properties of Nb3X4. Since the previous work on Nb3S4 did not apply a magnetic field, the specific-heat measurement was reexamined to improve the accuracy under a magnetic field. We also present a comparison of the experimental results with BCS predictions for both Nb3S4 and Nb3Se4. As a result, we clarify the anisotropy and weak- coupling effects. Further, we discuss the superconducting property of Nb_{3}Te_{4}.

## II Experimental Procedure

Single crystals of Nb_{3}X_{4} were prepared by an iodine vapor transport method following Nakada and Ishihara [21, 22] on the basis of the earlier work of Ruysink _et al._[7] Grown crystals were always fibers. The crystals were examined by Weissenberg-photography analysis and were identified to be Nb_{3}S_{4}, Nb_{3}Se_{4}, and Nb_{3}Te_{4}. Needlelike crystals were elongated parallel to the c axis, which were confirmed by an x-ray oscillation photography method.

The specific heat of Nb_{3}X_{4} was measured using a thermal-relaxation method [23] in the temperature range from 1.4 to 30 K for Nb_{3}S_{4} and from 0.5 to 30 K for both Nb_{3}Se_{4} and Nb_{3}Te_{4}. The measurement was carried out in both zero magnetic field and a magnetic field of 14 kOe. The magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the c axis. For this direction to the crystal axis of the applied field, Nb_{3}X_{4} has the lowest value of the upper critical field H_{c2}: about 5 kOe at 0 K for Nb_{3}S_{4}. [10] Several single crystals of total mass of about 50 mg were greased to a sapphire bolometer with the addenda contributing about 10% to the heat capacity. The temperature of a sample was measured using a carbon-resistance thermometer below 7 K and a silicon diode thermometer above 7 K placed in close proximity to the sample. The carbon thermometer was calibrated in each run by comparing the resistor with a germanium thermometer.

As a test of the measurement apparatus, we measured the specific heat of an indium sample weighing 47 mg at temperatures between 1.5 and 9 K. The purity of the indium sample was 99.999%. The result was compared to the results of O'Neal and Phillips, [24] who measured an indium sample by the adiabatic-calorimeter method. Our result agreed to within 0.5% with theirs. The error in the specific heat of Nb_{3}X_{4} was about 4% below 1.4 K and 1% above 1.4 K, mainly due to the small mass of the sample used in the experiment.

## III Results

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat C of Nb_{3}S_{4} plotted as C/T vs T^{2}, where open and solid circles are data in zero magnetic field and in a field of 14 kOe. In Fig. 1, the data for this compound have been plotted on an expanded scale for the temperature range below 5.5 K. The jump \Delta C at T_{c} =3.78 K in the specific heat for zero field is due to the superconducting transition. The midpoint of the jump is defined as the superconducting-transition temperature T_{c} . This value is slightly small compared to that (T_{c} =4.0 K in Ref. [5]) determined by the measurement of the electrical resistivity. The width of the transition temperature is 0.14 K. The specific heat in the normal state is given by

\[C = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}\]

in the temperature range from 1.4 to 13 K. The solid line in Fig. 1 represents the least-squares fit of this equation to the data under the magnetic field with \gamma =13.6 \pm0.1 mJ/(mol K2) and \beta =0.328 \pm0.004 mJ/(mol K4). The magnitude of the normalized jump \Delta C/(\gamma T_{c}) is 1.11 \pm 0.02. The Debye temperature is given by \Theta_{D}^{\ \ \ }=(12/5)/(\pi^{\ \  15% smaller than that of Biberacher and Schwenk (15.6 mJ/mol K2). The magnitude of g is somewhat different from sample to sample and appears to be sensitive to the quality of the sample used.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of Nb3Se4 plotted as _C_/_T_ vs T2, where open and solid circles are data in zero magnetic field and in a field of 14 kOe. In Fig. 2, the data for Nb3Se4 have been plotted on an expanded scale for the temperature range below 3.2 K. The jump at _T_c = 2.31 K in the specific heat for zero field is also due to the superconducting transition. The transition temperature was determined in the same way as Nb3S4. However, the value is somewhat larger than that (_T_c = 2.0 K in Ref. 5) determined by the measurement of the electrical resistivity. The width of the transition temperature is about 0.2 K. The specific heat in the normal state is given by Eq. (1) in the temperature range from 1.4 to 7 K. The solid line in Fig. 2 is the least-squares fit of Eq. (1) to the data under a magnetic field with g = 21.4 +- 0.2 mJ/(mol K2) and b = 1.27 +- 0.02 mJ/(mol K4). The magnitude of D_C_/(g_T_c) is 0.66 +- 0.01. The results of our measurement for Nb3Se4 are shown in Tables 1 and 2. From these results we estimated the values of Ph_D_, l, and _D_(e_F) in the same way as Nb3S4, as shown in Table 1.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of Nb3Te4 plotted as _C_/_T_ vs T2. Open and solid circles are data for zero magnetic field and a magnetic field of 14 kOe. Solid line shows the least-squares fit to data 0.5 to 2.1 K given by _C_/_T_ = _g_/_T_2 with g = 18.7 +- 0.8 mJ/(mol K2) and b = 11.4 +- 0.3 mJ/(mol K4).

  provement of the accuracy, because the temperature range that Eq. (1) holds true expands from T_{c} to lower temperature. Figure 5 shows the deviation D(t) of h = H_{c}(t)/H_{c}(0) from the parabolic law plotted as D(t) vs t^{2}, where D(t) = h - (1 - t^{2}) and t = T/T_{c}. In this figure, solid and open circles are D(t) for Nb3S4 and Nb3Se4; here, the BCS prediction is shown by open squares for comparison. The absolute values of D(t) increase in the following order: BCS prediction, Nb3S4, Nb3Se4. The values of H_{c}(0) for Nb3S4 and Nb3Se4 are shown in Table 2.

## IV Discussion

The specific-heat jump of Nb3S4 (1.11\gamma T_{c}) is substantially small as compared with the BCS value of 1.43\gamma T_{c},[26] while that of Nb3Se4 (0.66\gamma T_{c}) is less than half of the BCS value. The values of \lambda for Nb3X_{4} are close to the weak-coupling limit compared to \lambda\equiv0.8 of Nb (Ref. [25]) and NbSe2,[27] which are considered to be intermediate strong-coupling superconductors. The curves of D(t) for both Nb3S4 and Nb3Se4 lie below that of the BCS isotropic-gap model. Such behavior can, therefore, be treated within the weak-coupling BCS theory. In weak-coupling superconductors, these phenomena are interpreted in terms of the presence of an energy-gap anisotropy: When the energy gap is anisotropic, there is a thermal selection of participating quasiparticles. At lower temperature, electrons related to the smaller energy gap can be contributed to the electronic specific heat. Clem has calculated the effects of an anisotropic-energy gap on the thermodynamic properties of superconductors.[28] His results lead to the following modifications in the thermodynamic properties of the BCS prediction:

\[2\,e_{0}/(k_{B}T_{c}) = 3.528(1 - 3\,\langle a^{2}\rangle/2),\] (4)

\[2\,\pi\,\gamma\,\{T_{c}/H_{c}(0)\}^{2} = 1.057(1 + 2\,\langle a^{2}\rangle),\] (5)

\[\Delta\,C/(\gamma T_{c}) = 1.426(1 - 4\,\langle a^{2}\rangle),\] (6)

where e_{0} is the averaged energy gap at 0 K and \langle a^{2}\rangle, the mean-squared anisotropy, is the average over the Fermi surface of the square of the deviation of the energy-gap parameter from its average. The values of \langle a^{2}\rangle calculated from Eqs. (5) and (6) are 0.07 and 0.06 for Nb3S4 and are 0.15 and 0.13 for Nb3Se4. Both compounds have much larger mean-squared anisotropies than that of the layer compound 2H-NbSe2 (\langle a^{2}\rangle\equiv0.04).[27] The value of \langle a^{2}\rangle increases in the order of increasing lattice anisotropy in these compounds. Hence these large values may be due to the filamentary nature of these compounds. Using the average value of \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.07 \pm 0.02 for Nb3S4 and \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.14 \pm 0.03 for Nb3Se4, the values of 2\varepsilon_{0}/(k_{B}T_{c}) are obtained to be 3.1\pm0.1 for Nb3S4 and 2.8\pm0.1 for Nb3Se4. These values are listed in Table 2.

As mentioned above, Nb3Te4 becomes superconducting at about 2 K in the electrical-resistivity measurement. Nevertheless, the specific heat in Nb3Te4 changed smoothly and continuously with temperature down to about 0.5 K and did not show a characteristic of superconducting transition near T_{c}. Further, in order to investigate the thermodynamic state of Nb3Te4, the magnetization of Nb3Te4 was measured by an ac mutual inductance method down to about 0.5 K. No trace of a Meissner effect was observed down to 1.4 K, and the effect occurred appreciably below about 1.4 K. The susceptibility nearly saturated at 0.6 K and reached about 90% of -1/4\pi at about 0.5 K. At a glance, this result suggests that the superconductivity of Nb3Te4 is at least a bulk effect below 1.4 K. However, such a result is in conflict with the result of the specific-heat measurement. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is as follows.

The crystal structure of Nb3Te4 consists of Nb chains running along the c axis, as described in Sec. I. The distance between the Nb atoms in a chain is metallic, but the interchain distance exceeds the metallic distance. Hence Nb3Te4 is regarded as an aggregate of one-dimensional chains that are weakly coupled through Josephson-type junctions. In such a superconductor, ac susceptibility measurements can lead to quite erroneous results due to filamentary superconductivity. Very small superconducting volume fractions may shield the entire sample if the superconducting regions are physically connected by such as Josephson junctions. On the contrary, specific-heat measurements detect only true bulk

  superconductivity. For this reason, the result of the specific-heat measurement at low temperatures indicates that the superconductivity of Nb_{3}Te_{4} is filamentary. We intend to study in more detail the susceptibility of Nb_{3}Te_{4} in order to test this hypothesis.

Now we consider the thermodynamic state of Nb_{3}Te_{4} at low temperatures. Since the Meissner effect was not observed down to 1.4 K and the magnitude of the upper critical field[12] is substantially smaller than the applied field, the specific heat above 1.4 K under a magnetic field is that of the normal state. Furthermore, the specific heat below 1.4 K can be regarded as that of the normal state with a good approximation. This is because the specific heat below 1.4 K can be expressed by extrapolation of the straight line approximation for the normal state in Fig. 3.

In summary, we measured the specific heats of Nb_{3}S_{4}, Nb_{3}Se_{4}, and Nb_{3}Te_{4} in the normal and superconducting states. The magnitude of the specific-heat jump decreased in the order Nb_{3}S_{4}, Nb_{3}Se_{4}. The behavior of the specific heat in the superconducting state for both Nb_{3}S_{4} and Nb_{3}Se_{4} may be accounted for by the weak-coupling BCS theory included an anisotropic-energy gap. The mean-squared anisotropies \langle a^{2}\rangle are 0.07\pm0.02 and 0.14\pm0.03 for Nb_{3}S_{4} and Nb_{3}Se_{4}. The normalized energy gaps 2_e_{0}_/(_k_{B}T_{c}_) are 3.1\pm0.1 and 2.8\pm0.1 for Nb_{3}S_{4} and Nb_{3}Se_{4}. Such thermodynamic behavior indicates that both compounds are highly anisotropic and weak-coupling superconductors. Detailed confirmation of this interpretation will require studies of the energy gap of Nb_{3}S_{4} and Nb_{3}Se_{4} through the measurements of the specific heat with a high accuracy down to more low temperature, tunneling spectroscopy measurements, or other techniques which yield less of a macroscopic average than the specific heat. In Nb_{3}Te_{4}, no trace of the superconducting transition was found in the specific heat down to about 0.5 K. This result indicates that Nb_{3}Te_{4} is a filamentary superconductor.

###### Abstract

The specific heats of Nb3S4, Nb3Se4, and Nb3Te4 were measured in the temperature range from 0.5 to 30 K. The magnitude of the jump at the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} was 1.11 +- 0.02 _gT__c_ for Nb3S4 and 0.66 +- 0.01 _gT__c_ for Nb3Se4. The superconducting property for both compounds is discussed on the basis of the weak-coupling BCS theory as extended by Clem to include the effects of energy-gap anisotropy. We estimated the mean-squared anisotropy \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.07 +- 0.02 and the reduced-energy gap 2_e__f_(_k__B__T_) = 3.1 +- 0.1 for Nb3S4, and \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.14 +- 0.03 and 2_e__g_/(_k__B__T_) = 2.8 +- 0.1 for Nb3Se4. For Nb3Te4, although it becomes superconducting at about 2 K in the electrical-resistivity measurement, an excess of specific heat due to the superconducting transition was not found down to about 0.5 K. We also discuss the superconducting property of Nb3Te4.

A number of transition-metal chalcogenides crystallizes in fiber structures [1] which become superconducting at low temperatures [2,3] or undergo phase transitions due to charge-density-wave (CDW) formation.

The ratios of d1 d1 are 1.169, 1.236, and 1.298 in the above order. Hence the anisotropy of the crystal structures increases according to the above order. This large anisotropy leads to weak coupling. Another remarkable feature of the Nb3X4 structure is the presence of large infinite void channels along the c axis.

Reflecting the above-mentioned characteristic of the crystal structure, Nb3X4 shows high anisotropy in the electrical properties such as resistivity [9] and critical field [10, 11, 12]. Furthermore, the electrical resistivity in both Nb3S4 (Ref. [9]) and Nb3Se4 (Ref.

The ratios of the conduction-band width along the chain direction to that along the perpendicular direction are 15, 18, and 19 for Nb3S4, Nb3Se4, and Nb3Te4. Bullet [19] and Canadell and Whangbo [20] have also obtained similar results for the band structure of Nb3S4 using an atomic-orbital method and a tight-binding method.

For this direction to the crystal axis of the applied field, Nb_{3}X_{4} has the lowest value of the upper critical field H_{c2}: about 5 kOe at 0 K for Nb_{3}S_{4}. [10] Several single crystals of total mass of about 50 mg were greased to a sapphire bolometer with the addenda contributing about 10% to the heat capacity. The temperature of a sample was measured using a carbon-resistance thermometer below 7 K and a silicon diode thermometer above 7 K placed in close proximity to the sample. The carbon thermometer was calibrated in each run by comparing the resistor with a germanium thermometer.

As a test of the measurement apparatus, we measured the specific heat of an indium sample weighing 47 mg at temperatures between 1.5 and 9 K. The purity of the indium sample was 99.999%. The result was compared to the results of O'Neal and Phillips, [24] who measured an indium sample by the adiabatic-calorimeter method. Our result agreed to within 0.5% with theirs. The error in the specific heat of Nb_{3}X_{4} was about 4% below 1.4 K and 1% above 1.4 K, mainly due to the small mass of the sample used in the experiment.

## III Results

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat C of Nb_{3}S_{4} plotted as C/T vs T^{2}, where open and solid circles are data in zero magnetic field and in a field of 14 kOe. In Fig. 1, the data for this compound have been plotted on an expanded scale for the temperature range below 5.5 K. The jump \Delta C at T_{c} =3.78 K in the specific heat for zero field is due to the superconducting transition. The midpoint of the jump is defined as the superconducting-transition temperature T_{c} . This value is slightly small compared to that (T_{c} =4.0 K in Ref. [5]) determined by the measurement of the electrical resistivity. The width of the transition temperature is 0.14 K. The specific heat in the normal state is given by

\[C = \gamma T + \beta T^{3}\]

in the temperature range from 1.4 to 13 K. The solid line in Fig. 1 represents the least-squares fit of this equation to the data under the magnetic field with \gamma =13.6 \pm0.1 mJ/(mol K2) and \beta =0.328 \pm0.004 mJ/(mol K4). The magnitude of the normalized jump \Delta C/(\gamma T_{c}) is 1.11 \pm 0.02. The Debye temperature is given by \Theta_{D}^{\ \ \ }=(12/5)/(\pi^{\ \  15% smaller than that of Biberacher and Schwenk (15.6 mJ/mol K2). The magnitude of g is somewhat different from sample to sample and appears to be sensitive to the quality of the sample used.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of Nb3Se4 plotted as _C_/_T_ vs T2, where open and solid circles are data in zero magnetic field and in a field of 14 kOe. In Fig. 2, the data for Nb3Se4 have been plotted on an expanded scale for the temperature range below 3.2 K. The jump at _T_c = 2.31 K in the specific heat for zero field is also due to the superconducting transition. The transition temperature was determined in the same way as Nb3S4. However, the value is somewhat larger than that (_T_c = 2.0 K in Ref. 5) determined by the measurement of the electrical resistivity. The width of the transition temperature is about 0.2 K. The specific heat in the normal state is given by Eq. (1) in the temperature range from 1.4 to 7 K. The solid line in Fig. 2 is the least-squares fit of Eq. (1) to the data under a magnetic field with g = 21.4 +- 0.2 mJ/(mol K2) and b = 1.27 +- 0.02 mJ/(mol K4). The magnitude of D_C_/(g_T_c) is 0.66 +- 0.01. The results of our measurement for Nb3Se4 are shown in Tables 1 and 2. From these results we estimated the values of Ph_D_, l, and _D_(e_F) in the same way as Nb3S4, as shown in Table 1.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of Nb3Te4 plotted as _C_/_T_ vs T2. Open and solid circles are data for zero magnetic field and a magnetic field of 14 kOe. Solid line shows the least-squares fit to data 0.5 to 2.1 K given by _C_/_T_ = _g_/_T_2 with g = 18.7 +- 0.8 mJ/(mol K2) and b = 11.4 +- 0.3 mJ/(mol K4).

  provement of the accuracy, because the temperature range that Eq. (1) holds true expands from T_{c} to lower temperature. Figure 5 shows the deviation D(t) of h = H_{c}(t)/H_{c}(0) from the parabolic law plotted as D(t) vs t^{2}, where D(t) = h - (1 - t^{2}) and t = T/T_{c}. In this figure, solid and open circles are D(t) for Nb3S4 and Nb3Se4; here, the BCS prediction is shown by open squares for comparison. The absolute values of D(t) increase in the following order: BCS prediction, Nb3S4, Nb3Se4. The values of H_{c}(0) for Nb3S4 and Nb3Se4 are shown in Table 2.

## IV Discussion

The specific-heat jump of Nb3S4 (1.11\gamma T_{c}) is substantially small as compared with the BCS value of 1.43\gamma T_{c},[26] while that of Nb3Se4 (0.66\gamma T_{c}) is less than half of the BCS value. The values of \lambda for Nb3X_{4} are close to the weak-coupling limit compared to \lambda\equiv0.8 of Nb (Ref. [25]) and NbSe2,[27] which are considered to be intermediate strong-coupling superconductors. The curves of D(t) for both Nb3S4 and Nb3Se4 lie below that of the BCS isotropic-gap model. Such behavior can, therefore, be treated within the weak-coupling BCS theory. In weak-coupling superconductors, these phenomena are interpreted in terms of the presence of an energy-gap anisotropy: When the energy gap is anisotropic, there is a thermal selection of participating quasiparticles. At lower temperature, electrons related to the smaller energy gap can be contributed to the electronic specific heat. Clem has calculated the effects of an anisotropic-energy gap on the thermodynamic properties of superconductors.[28] His results lead to the following modifications in the thermodynamic properties of the BCS prediction:

\[2\,e_{0}/(k_{B}T_{c}) = 3.528(1 - 3\,\langle a^{2}\rangle/2),\] (4)

\[2\,\pi\,\gamma\,\{T_{c}/H_{c}(0)\}^{2} = 1.057(1 + 2\,\langle a^{2}\rangle),\] (5)

\[\Delta\,C/(\gamma T_{c}) = 1.426(1 - 4\,\langle a^{2}\rangle),\] (6)

where e_{0} is the averaged energy gap at 0 K and \langle a^{2}\rangle, the mean-squared anisotropy, is the average over the Fermi surface of the square of the deviation of the energy-gap parameter from its average. The values of \langle a^{2}\rangle calculated from Eqs. (5) and (6) are 0.07 and 0.06 for Nb3S4 and are 0.15 and 0.13 for Nb3Se4. Both compounds have much larger mean-squared anisotropies than that of the layer compound 2H-NbSe2 (\langle a^{2}\rangle\equiv0.04).[27] The value of \langle a^{2}\rangle increases in the order of increasing lattice anisotropy in these compounds. Hence these large values may be due to the filamentary nature of these compounds. Using the average value of \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.07 \pm 0.02 for Nb3S4 and \langle a^{2}\rangle = 0.14 \pm 0.03 for Nb3Se4, the values of 2\varepsilon_{0}/(k_{B}T_{c}) are obtained to be 3.1\pm0.1 for Nb3S4 and 2.8\pm0.1 for Nb3Se4. These values are listed in Table 2.

As mentioned above, Nb3Te4 becomes superconducting at about 2 K in the electrical-resistivity measurement. Nevertheless, the specific heat in Nb3Te4 changed smoothly and continuously with temperature down to about 0.5 K and did not show a characteristic of superconducting transition near T_{c}. Further, in order to investigate the thermodynamic state of Nb3Te4, the magnetization of Nb3Te4 was measured by an ac mutual inductance method down to about 0.5 K. No trace of a Meissner effect was observed down to 1.4 K, and the effect occurred appreciably below about 1.4 K. The susceptibility nearly saturated at 0.6 K and reached about 90% of -1/4\pi at about 0.5 K. At a glance, this result suggests that the superconductivity of Nb3Te4 is at least a bulk effect below 1.4 K. However, such a result is in conflict with the result of the specific-heat measurement. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is as follows.

The crystal structure of Nb3Te4 consists of Nb chains running along the c axis, as described in Sec. I. The distance between the Nb atoms in a chain is metallic, but the interchain distance exceeds the metallic distance. Hence Nb3Te4 is regarded as an aggregate of one-dimensional chains that are weakly coupled through Josephson-type junctions. In such a superconductor, ac susceptibility measurements can lead to quite erroneous results due to filamentary superconductivity. Very small superconducting volume fractions may shield the entire sample if the superconducting regions are physically connected by such as Josephson junctions. On the contrary, specific-heat measurements detect only true bulk

  superconductivity. For this reason, the result of the specific-heat measurement at low temperatures indicates that the superconductivity of Nb_{3}Te_{4} is filamentary. We intend to study in more detail the susceptibility of Nb_{3}Te_{4} in order to test this hypothesis.

Now we consider the thermodynamic state of Nb_{3}Te_{4} at low temperatures. Since the Meissner effect was not observed down to 1.4 K and the magnitude of the upper critical field[12] is substantially smaller than the applied field, the specific heat above 1.4 K under a magnetic field is that of the normal state. Furthermore, the specific heat below 1.4 K can be regarded as that of the normal state with a good approximation. This is because the specific heat below 1.4 K can be expressed by extrapolation of the straight line approximation for the normal state in Fig. 3.

In summary, we measured the specific heats of Nb_{3}S_{4}, Nb_{3}Se_{4}, and Nb_{3}Te_{4} in the normal and superconducting states. The magnitude of the specific-heat jump decreased in the order Nb_{3}S_{4}, Nb_{3}Se_{4}. The behavior of the specific heat in the superconducting state for both Nb_{3}S_{4} and Nb_{3}Se_{4} may be accounted for by the weak-coupling BCS theory included an anisotropic-energy gap. The mean-squared anisotropies \langle a^{2}\rangle are 0.07\pm0.02 and 0.14\pm0.03 for Nb_{3}S_{4} and Nb_{3}Se_{4}. The normalized energy gaps 2_e_{0}_/(_k_{B}T_{c}_) are 3.1\pm0.1 and 2.8\pm0.1 for Nb_{3}S_{4} and Nb_{3}Se_{4}. Such thermodynamic behavior indicates that both compounds are highly anisotropic and weak-coupling superconductors. Detailed confirmation of this interpretation will require studies of the energy gap of Nb_{3}S_{4} and Nb_{3}Se_{4} through the measurements of the specific heat with a high accuracy down to more low temperature, tunneling spectroscopy measurements, or other techniques which yield less of a macroscopic average than the specific heat. In Nb_{3}Te_{4}, no trace of the superconducting transition was found in the specific heat down to about 0.5 K. This result indicates that Nb_{3}Te_{4} is a filamentary superconductor.
