###### Abstract

We have studied (LuC)2(Ni2B2) and (LuC)(Ni2B2) at ambient and high pressures. Superconductivity was discovered in (LuC)2(Ni2B2) at 2.9 K. Pressure was found to suppress both the electrical resistivity and the superconducting transition temperature rapidly for (LuC)2(Ni2B2) but only slightly for (LuC)(Ni2B2), in spite of their similar chemical-bonding behavior. The observations can be understood in terms of the smaller density of states at the Fermi surface and the greater pressure-induced band broadening of (LuC)2(Ni2B2) than (LuC)(Ni2B2).

## I Introduction

Recently, Cava _et al._1 discovered superconductivity in a new family of intermetallic compounds, _R_Ni2B2C = (_R_ C)(Ni2B2), where \(R\) =Lu, Y, Tm, Er, and Ho, with a transition temperature (_T_c) varying from 17 to 8 K. Later, Eisaki _et al._2 observed that the _T_c scales approximately with the de Gennes factor, implying that there exists a non-negligible coupling between the rare-earth magnetic moments and the conduction electrons. Siegrist _et al._3 found that (_R_ C)(Ni2B2) displays a tetragonal body-centered layerlike structure with a \(I\)4/_mmm_ symmetry. (_R_ C)(_NI2B2) may thus be considered as alternate stackings of the NaCl-type (_R_C) and the inverse PbO-type (Ni2B2) layers. The unit-cell volume of _R_Ni2B2C increases with the ionic radius of \(R\). Superconductivity appears to be confined to those with \(R\) smaller than Tb. It was further suggested3 that the insertion of more (_R_ C) and/or (Ni2B2) layers gives rise to the homologous series (_R_ C)(Ni2B2) with \(n\) and \(m\) = 1,2, ... . Indeed, (LuC)2(Ni2B2) was found to exist in a tetragonal structure with a \(P\)4/_nmm_ symmetry. However, (LuC)2(Ni2B2) was reported3 to be not superconducting.

Despite the scaling of the _T_C and the de Gennes factor of _R_Ni2B2C, LaNi2B2C with the nonmagnetic La is not superconducting. The clustering of the superconducting _R_Ni2B2C to those with a small _R_'s suggests that interatomic and interlayer spacing may also play a role in this interesting compound family. Although coupling between (Ni2B2) layers is strong as evidenced by the short B--C bonds3 and the small anisotropy in the magnetic properties of a similar compound Y-Pd-B-C,4 the layered structure of (_R_ C)_m_(Ni2B2)n is a reminiscence of the layered cuprates, e.g., (TIO)2(Ca1-1nCuO2)n = Tl,Ba2Ca_n_-1Cu_n_O2n_+ C wafers (99.9%). Stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials were arc melted in a water-cooled Cu hearth in an Ar atmosphere at least four times. The buttons were turned over between melts to enhance homogeneity. The overall loss in weight of the sample due to arc melting was less than 1%.

Bar-shaped samples were cut from the arc-melted buttons for electrical and magnetic measurements. The resistivity was determined by the standard four-lead method, the magnetic susceptibility by a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer and the structure by a Rigaku D-MAX III powder diffractometer. The hydrostatic-pressure environment for the electrical measurements was generated by the self-clamp technique,6 using 3M Fluorinert as the fluid pressure medium. A superconducting Pb manometer situated next to the sample was used for the pressure determination and a Ge thermometer for the temperature.

## III Results and Discussion

The x-ray powder-diffraction patterns of the (LuC)2(Ni2B2) and (LuC)(Ni2B2) samples are shown in Fig. 1. The purity of the (LuC)2(Ni2B2) sample is greater than 95% and that of the (LuC)(Ni2B2) is only about 80 to 90 % with a small amount of unknown impurities. The lattice parameters are \(a\) = 3.492 and 3.467 A and \(c\) = 7.552 and 10.633 A, respectively for (LuC)2(Ni2B2) and (LuC)(Ni2B2), in good agreement with the previously published results.3 The observed intensities of the diffraction lines are compared with the calculated ones based on the atomic positions given by Siegrist _et al._, 3 as shown in Table 1. For later discussions, the layerlike atomic arrangements are shown for the two compounds in Fig. 2.

The resistivity \(r\) of the two compounds is displayed in Fig. 3 as a function of temperature. (LuC)2(Ni2B2) is clearly superconducting with _T_c ~ 2.9 K, in contrast to a

  previous report.3 The \(T_{c}\) of (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) is \(\sim\)16.7 K, similar to that previously reported.1 The qualitative difference between the \(\rho(T)\)'s shown for the two (Fig. 3) is rather evident, regardless of the 10 to 20 % impurity phases present in (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)). The \(\rho\) is generally smaller for the crystalline sample of (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) than for (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)), e.g., at room temperature 36 \(\mu\Omega\) cm for the former and 121 for the latter, respectively. There exists a distinct linear \(T\) term in \(\rho(T)\) above \(\sim\)120 K and a quadratic \(T^{2}\) term below for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)). On the other hand, the \(\rho(T)\) of (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) exhibits a large negative curvature and a large temperature dependence above \(\sim\) 25 K.

The dc magnetic susceptibility \(\chi\) as a function of temperature measured at 5 G is shown in Fig. 4 for the two samples. Relative sharp superconducting transitions are clearly evident at \(\sim\) 2.9 and 16.5 K for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) and (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)), respectively. The latter is similar to that previously observed.2 The samples cooled in zero field show a magnetic shielding equal to \(\sim\) 70-100 % of that of a perfect superconductor. They display a Meissner effect of \(\sim\) 10% of that of a perfect superconductor, on cooling in a field, perhaps due to flux trapping. All magnetizations are deduced based on the theoretical densities without the demagnetization corrections. The observation suggests that the superconducting is a bulk effect.

Under pressure, both \(\rho\) and the superconducting transition are rapidly shifted linearly downward for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) as shown in Fig. 5 but only slightly so for (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)). The pressure effects on \(\rho\) and \(T_{c}\) are summarized in Figs. 6 and 7, for the two compounds. The value of \(d\) ln_\(\rho\)/_dP_ at room temperature for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) is \(-\)9 x 10\({}^{-2}\) GPa\({}^{-1}\), about 20 times that of (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)). The pressure effects \(dT_{c}\)/_dP_'s are \(-\)0.14 K/GPa and \(-\)0.05 K/GPa for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) and (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)), respectively.

By assuming that the impurity phases do not contribute significantly to the conductivity of (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)), the large negative curvature and the relatively large temperature dependence of \(\rho(T)\) shown in Fig. 3 can be attributed to the close proximity of the Fermi surface to the density of states peak, similar to the \(A\) 15 (Ref. 7) compounds. The high \(T_{c}\) of 17 K in this compound may therefore be understood. On the other hand, the absence of the large negative curvature, and the weaker temperature dependence in \(\rho\) of (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) may suggest a lower density of states near the Fermi surface in this compound, resulting in its lower \(T_{c}\) of 2.9 K. The superconductivity in (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) can be attributed greatly to the high density of states associated with the itinerant 3\(d\) electrons in the Ni atoms. The present observation implies that there must exist subtle difference between the Ni local environments in the two compounds (e.g., the hybridization between the Ni-3\(d\) and the C-2\(\rho\) electrons).

Under pressure, \(T_{c}\) decreases rapidly for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) as shown in Fig. 7. The relative pressure effect on the transition temperature (\(d\)ln\(T_{c}\)/_dP_), which is a better measure of the pressure influence on the superconducting properties of a solid, is \(-\)4.7 x 10\({}^{-2}\) GPa\({}^{-1}\). We ascribe such a large \(T_{c}\) suppression mainly to a possible band broadening, which leads to a decrease in the density of states at the Fermi surface. This appears to be consistent with the large suppression of \(\rho\) by pressure as shown in Fig. 6. The small pressure effect on the \(T_{c}\) of (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)), i.e., \(d\) ln\(T_{c}\)/_dP_ = \(-\)0.3 x 10\({}^{-3}\) GPa\({}^{-1}\) may be due to the insensitivity of its electronic structure of the compound to pressure, consistent with the small pressure effect on its \(\rho\). The large difference in \(d\) ln\(T_{c}\)/_dP_'s observed are also rather unexpected, based on their similar chemical bonding.3 Since the Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) layers are rigid, the different pressure effects on \(T_{c}\) may result from the different inter-Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) layer compressibilities of the two compounds, i.e., greater for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) than for (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)).

In conclusion, we have studied (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) and (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) at ambient and high pressures. (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) was found to be superconducting at an unexpectedly low \(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 2.9 K. Under pressures, both \(\rho\) and \(T_{c}\) decreases rapidly for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) but only slightly for (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)). The observations can be explained in terms of a smaller but a more pressure-sensitive density of states at the Fermi surface of (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)). The decrease of this small density of states of (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) under pressure may be associated with the pressure induced hybridization between the Ni-3\(d\) and C-2\(\rho\) electrons. The results suggest the possible existence of subtle differences between the local Ni environments in the two compounds.

Footnote 3: The \(\rho\)-dependence of the resistivity \(\rho\) is not a function of temperature but also of temperature.

_Note:_ Upon completion of this work, we have learned of the work of L. F. Mattheis in which the band properties of both (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) and (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)) were calculated. His results show that, while the Fermi level coincides with a density-of-states peak associated with the Ni(3\(d\)) bands for (LuC)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)), there is no peak in the density of states near the Fermi level for (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)). This is consistent with our observations of a lower resistivity and a much lower \(T_{c}\) in (LuC)\({}_{2}\)(Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)).
