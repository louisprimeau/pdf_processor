###### Abstract

Single crystals of (Ca1-_x_La_x_)10(Pt3As8)(Fe2As2)5 (_x_ = 0-0.182) superconductors have been grown and characterized by x-ray, microprobe, transport, and thermodynamic measurements. Features in the magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and two kinks in the derivative of the electrical resistivity around 100 K in the \(x\) = 0 compound support the existence of decoupled structural and magnetic phase transitions. With La doping, the structural/magnetic phase transitions are suppressed and a half dome of superconductivity with a maximal _Tc_ around 26 K is observed in the temperature-concentration phase diagram.

The report of superconductivity at 26 K in LaFeAsO0.9F0.1 (Ref. [1]) has led to the discovery of several families of high _Tc_ iron arsenide superconductors, including the so-called 1111, 122, 111, and 42 622 families.\({}^{2,-4}\) The intense study of these families has enriched our understanding of the interplay among structure, magnetism, and superconductivity. Recently a new iron-arsenide compound, Ca10(Pt3As8)(Fe2As2)5 (the so-called 10-3-8 compound), has been characterized.\({}^{5,-7}\) This compound crystallizes in a triclinic structure with space group _P_-1 and has -Ca-(Pt3As8)-Ca-(Fe2As2)- layer stacking, as shown in the left inset of Fig. 1. The FeAs layer is made of edge-sharing FeAs4 tetrahedra, the key structural element in all the Fe-pnictide superconductors. A structural phase transition around 100 K has been revealed in this compound using polarized light imaging.\({}^{8}\) Although the susceptibility drop observed to accompany the long range antiferromagnetic ordering in the 1111 and 122 families has yet to be reported for the 10-3-8 parent compound,\({}^{5,0}\) recent NMR measurements show that this compound orders antiferromagnetically (AFM) below \(\sim\)100 K.\({}^{10}\) With Pt substitution on the Fe sites, superconductivity up to 12 K has been realized.\({}^{5,5}\) In the 1111 and 122 families, doping on the intermediary layer results in a higher _Tc_ than doping on the FeAs layers, and thus higher _Tc_ may be expected for intermediary layer doping in the 10-3-8 compound as well. Indeed, 20% La doping on the Ca sites in this compound was found to show a _Tc_ of 30 K.\({}^{11}\) In this Rapid Communication, we report the systematic characterization of (Ca1-_x_La_x_)10(Pt3As8)(Fe2As2)5 single crystals via x-ray diffraction, microprobe, transport, and thermodynamic measurements. Due to the improved quality of the single crystals, we are able to observe a resistivity jump, a susceptibility drop, and a specific heat jump in the parent 10-3-8 compound, supporting the existence of both structural and magnetic phase transitions. A _T-x_ phase diagram for (Ca1-_x_La_x_)10(Pt3As8)(Fe2As2)5 is presented.

Platelike millimeter-sized single crystals were successfully grown from a CaAs-rich flux.\({}^{5}\)CaAs, FeAs, and LaAs precursors were made using the solid state reaction method. These precursors and Pt powder were mixed thoroughly according to the nominal ratios listed in Table 1; the total batch size was approximately 0.5 g. The mixture was pressed into a pellet, put in an Al2O3 crucible, and sealed into a quartz tube under vacuum. The resulting ampulses were heated up to 1150\({}^{\circ}\)C, held for 96 h, slowly cooled down to 885\({}^{\circ}\)C, and then quenched. After rinsing off the flux using distilled water, single crystals were obtained. These single crystals show a layered growth habit and are easily exfoliated and bent. In each batch, small crystals, with thickness less than 0.03 mm, were employed in the transport measurements. The La concentration \(x\) was obtained via wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) using the electron probe microanalyzer of a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe. WDS was performed on the measured transport samples to provide a reliable determination of the electronic phase diagram as a function of composition. The results of the WDS measurements are summarized in Table 1. These measurements directly indicate that La has been successfully doped on the Ca sites, while the Pt substitution on the FeAs layer is well controlled: It is 0 for the \(x\) = 0 compound; 0.007 for the \(x\) = 0.021, 0.043, 0.065, and 0.145 compounds; and 0.02 for the \(x\) = 0.093 and 0.182 compounds. In this Rapid Communication, \(x\) refers to the WDS value. Transport and specific heat measurements were performed in a Quantum Design (QD) physical properties measurement system. Magnetic properties were measured in a QD magnetic properties measurement system. To easily compare the physical properties of these superconductors with other iron arsenide superconductors, the units of molar susceptibility, magnetization, and heat capacity presented are normalized to per mole Fe2.

X-ray diffraction was performed on a Scintag X1 Advances Diffraction System employing Cu _Kx_ (_l_ = 1.5406 A) radiation. No FeAs, PtAs2, or other impurities were observed in any x-ray pattern. Figure 1 shows the (00_L_) diffraction pattern of (Ca1-_x_La_x_)10(Pt3As8)(Fe2As2)5 (_x_ = 0,0.182). A peak shift between these two samples is observed. By refining the (00_L_) diffraction patterns via the unitcell software\({}^{12}\) the interlayer distances of the FeAs layers were obtained. The right inset of Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the interlayer FeAs distance with \(x\). This distance increases monotonically with La doping from 10.313(2) A in the parent compound to 10.368(2) A in the \(x=0.182\) compound, providing further evidence that La is incorporated into the structure.

The physical properties of the parent compound are summarized in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity. The resistivity is 0.57 mD cm at 300 K, which is almost twice as that of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\).[13, 14]\(\rho(T)\) shows a resistivity minimum at \(T_{\rm min}\). \(T_{\rm min}\) is sample dependent, varying from larger than 300 K to 170 K, with an average of 210 K. It is unclear whether \(T_{\rm min}\) comes from disorder or other mechanisms, such as charge gap formation. With decreasing temperature, an abrupt resistivity increase with a bump feature occurs below \(\sim\)100 K. No hysteresis is observed between zero field cooling (ZFC) and warming \(\rho(T)\) data. The inset shows the temperature derivative of the electrical resistivity \(d\rho/dT\) obtained at \(H=0\) and 9 T. The parent 10-3-8 compound shows two kinks at \(T_{1}=103\) K and \(T_{2}=95\) K in \(d\rho/dT\). These features are also observed in underdoped Ba(Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\),[15] where the higher temperature kink is related to the structural phase transition and the lower temperature kink is related to the magnetic phase transition,[16] suggesting that a structural phase transition in the parent 10-3-8 phase may occur at 103 K and a magnetic phase transition may occur at 95 K. No change in the temperature of the anomalies is observed with 9 T applied field. Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependent susceptibility \(\chi(T)\) taken at 4 T. At 300 K, the susceptibility is around 1\(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\) emu/mol, similar to that of BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). Unlike the linear temperature dependence observed in BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (Refs. [17] and [18]) at high temperatures, from 300 to 100 K, the susceptibility is only weakly temperature dependent with a minimum around 200 K. As temperature decreases, a drop in susceptibility is observed at \(\sim\)100 K, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). This susceptibility drop is consistent with the resistivity measurement and supports the existence of a magnetic/structural phase transition despite the highly two-dimensional crystal structure. Below 80 K, a Curie tail is observed, which may be caused by magnetic impurities. This paramagnetic contribution combines with the intrinsic magnetism and may lead to the weakly temperature dependent susceptibility from 200 to 300 K. Figure 2(c) shows the temperature dependent specific heat data. A clear specific heat anomaly is observed around 100 K, which is consistent with both \(\rho(T)\) and \(\chi(T)\) data. Below 5 K, assuming there are no magnetic excitations, \(C_{p}/T\) obeys the relation of \(C_{p}/T=\gamma+\beta T^{\gamma}\), with an electronic specific heat coefficient \(\gamma=4.8\) mJ/mol Fe\({}_{2}\) K\({}^{2}\) and \(\beta=0.95\) mJ/mol Fe\({}_{2}\) K\({}^{3}\), corresponding to a Debye temperature of 256 K.

The evolution of the (Ca\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\))\({}_{10}\)(Pt\({}_{3}\)As\({}_{8}\))(Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) series with doping is presented in Fig. 3. Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependent Hall coefficient for the \(x=0.145\) compounds. The negative Hall coefficient indicates the dominant role of electrons. A dramatic slope change of \(\log_{10}|R_{H}|\), indicating a gap opening related to the structural/magnetic phase transition, is observed in the parent compound, but not in the \(x=0.145\) compound. Within the single band model, the carrier concentration is determined from \(n=-1/eR_{H}\), which leads to \(n_{300\,\rm K}^{=n=0}=8.7\times 10^{21}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) and \(n_{300\,\rm K}^{=0.145}=1.06\times 10^{22}\) cm\({}^{-3}\). Using the unit cell volume \(V=788.1\) A\({}^{3,5}\) the estimated extra carrier concentration due to the La doping is \(n_{300\,\rm K}^{=0.145}-n_{300\,\rm K}^{=0.204})\times V=1.5/\)unit cell. This number is consistent with the WDS measurement assuming one La atom adds one electron. Figure 3(b) shows the temperature dependent normalized resistivity \(R/R_{300\,\rm K}\). The high temperature resistive bump is suppressed to 87 K in the

  \(x=0.021\) compound. No resistive bump is detected when \(x\geqslant 0.043\). Comparing with the Pt doped 10-3-8 series,[5, 8] this implies that no structural phase transition occurs. For the samples with \(x\leqslant 0.093\), the normal state resistance shows a resistivity minimum at \(T_{\rm min}\). Although \(T_{\rm min}\) is sample dependent, its average value decreases with increasing doping and disappears at \(x=0.145\). From the pieces we measured, the average \(T_{\rm min}\) is \(210\pm 30\) K for \(x=0\), \(200\pm 15\) K for \(x=0.021\), \(180\pm 30\) K for \(x=0.043\), \(130\pm 40\) K for \(x=0.065\), and \(70\pm 5\) K for \(x=0.093\). Superconductivity occurs when \(x\geqslant 0.043\). Using the 50% criterion shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b), \(T_{c}\) first appears at \(13.3\) K in the \(x=0.043\) sample, rises to \(26.1\) K in the \(x=0.145\) sample, and then decreases to \(22.1\) K in the \(x=0.182\) sample. Figure 3(c) presents ZFC and FC susceptibility data taken at \(5\) mT with \(H\parallel ab\). The criterion to infer \(T_{c}\) is shown in the figure. Although the transitions are broader compared to Ba(Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals, the large shielding fraction is comparable to the \(122\) series, which indicates bulk superconductivity. A small Meissner fraction is a common feature in Fe-pnictide superconductors and is attributed to flux pinning. The temperature-composition phase diagram, constructed from the above physical properties, is shown in Fig. 3(d). With La doping, the structural/magnetic phase transitions are suppressed and superconductivity occurs, with a maximum \(T_{c}\) around \(26.1\) K at \(x=0.145\). Due to difficulty in controlling the doping level precisely around \(x=0.03\), it is not yet clear whether there is a coexistence region of AFM and superconductivity, nor is it clear how \(T_{2}\) evolves with doping. Further work is necessary to resolve these issues.

To study the superconducting state of the La doped 10-3-8 superconductors in detail, a representative sample with \(x=0.093\) was chosen. Figure 4(a) shows the specific heat measured at \(H=0\) and \(9\) T with \(H\perp ab\). A specific heat jump can be observed, confirming bulk superconductivity. The inset shows \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) taken at \(H=0\) T. The inferred residual \(\gamma\) is \(5.8\) mJ/mol Fe\({}_{2}\) K\({}^{2}\) and the Debye temperature is \(257\) K. Figure 4(b) shows a plot of \((C_{p}^{0\,\rm T}-C_{p}^{0\,\rm T})/T\) vs T. Using an equal entropy construction shown in Fig. 4(b), the resulting \(\Delta C_{p}/T_{c}\) is \(13\) mJ/mol Fe\({}_{2}\) K\({}^{2}\) and \(T_{c}\) is \(21.9\) K. These values fall onto the Budko-Ni-Canfield (BNC) log-log plot reasonably well,[19, 20, 21] adding one more example to the BNC scaling, which reveals \(\Delta C_{p}/T_{c}\) is proportional to \(T_{c}^{2}\) for a large number of \(122\), \(111\), and \(111\) based superconductors. The calculated \(\gamma_{n}\) factor \(22\) is \(16\pm 2\) mJ/mol Fe\({}_{2}\) K\({}^{2}\), leading to \(\Delta C_{p}/T_{c}\gamma_{n}\sim 0.8\). Figure 4(c) shows the suppression of \(T_{c}\) under an applied magnetic field, in which the resistive transition becomes much broader, indicating strong thermal fluctuations of vortices in this compound. Since \(T_{c}\) is suppressed by less than \(0.1\) K using the \(90\)% criterion when \(9\) T is applied along \(ab\) plane, only the \(50\)% and \(10\)% criteria are employed to infer \(T_{c}\) under field. The derived upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\) is summarized in Fig. 4(d). The orbital limiting \(H_{c2}(0)\) can be calculated via the WHH equation \(-0.69T_{c}^{\rm ad}H_{c2}/dT|_{T}\). Using the 50% criterion, the estimated \(H_{c2}^{\rm ad}(0)\sim 400\) T and \(H_{c2}^{\rm ad}(0)\sim 60\) T; the using the 10% criterion, the estimated \(H_{c2}^{\rm ad}(0)\sim 70\) T and \(H_{c2}^{\rm ad}(0)\sim 107\). \(H_{c2}^{\rm ad}(0)\) obtained from

It is unclear if there is a coexistence region of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.

  50% criterion is almost four times of that in SmFeAsO\({}_{0.8}\)F\({}_{0.2}\) with a \(T_{c}\) of 40 K, implying a very large gap formation. Although the \(H_{c2}^{Lab}\) curve inferred from the 50% criterion shows roughly linear behavior, the \(H_{c2}^{Lab}\) curve inferred from the 10% criterion shows upward curvature, which is common in cuprate and multigap 1111 superconductors.[23, 24, 25]

In conclusion, we have characterized superconducting (Ca\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\))\({}_{10}\)(Pt\({}_{3}\)As\({}_{8}\))(Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) (\(x\) = 0-0.182) single crystals. With La doping, the structural/magnetic phase transitions around 100 K in the pure 10-3-8 compound are suppressed. Bulk superconductivity occurs at 13.3 K at 4.4% doping, rises to 26.1 K at 14.5% doping, and then decreases to 22.1 K at 18.2% doping.
