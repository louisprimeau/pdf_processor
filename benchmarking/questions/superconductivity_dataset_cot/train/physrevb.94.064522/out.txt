###### Abstract

We demonstrate that Mn doping in the layered sulfides Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} leads to stable Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} compounds that exhibit both long-range ferromagnetism and enhanced superconductivity for 0.075 \leqslant _x_\leqslant 0.15, with a possible record superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) \sim15 K among all Bi_{2}-based superconductors. We conjecture that the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism may be attributed to Mn doping in the spacer Bi_{2}O_{2} layers away from the superconducting BiS_{2} layers, whereas the enhancement of T_{c} may be due to excess electron transfer to BiS_{2} from the Mn^{4+}/Mn^{3+} substitutions in Bi_{2}O_{2}. This notion is empirically corroborated by the increased electron-carrier densities upon Mn doping, and by further studies of the Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} compounds (_A_ = Co, Ni; x = 0.1, 0.125), where the T_{c} values remain comparable to that of the undoped Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} system (\sim4.5 K) due to lack of 4+ valences in either Co or Ni ions for excess electron transfer to the BiS_{2} layers. These findings therefore shed new light on feasible pathways to enhance the T_{c} values of BiS_{2}-based superconductors, although complete elucidation of the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in these anisotropic layered compounds awaits the development of single crystalline materials for further investigation.

## I Introduction

One of the commonalities among the cuprate and iron-based high-temperature superconductors is their layered structures [1, 2]. Interestingly, even for conventional superconductors, the highest superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) has been found in layered magnesium diboride MgB_{2}[3]. Recently, superconductivity with T_{c} = 4.5 K was discovered in a new superconductor Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}[4]. This compound has a layered structure composed of two superconducting BiS_{2} layers and spacer layers of Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x}, where x indicates the deficiency of (SO_{4})^{2-} ions at the interlayer sites. Since the discovery of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, several other BiS_{2}-based superconductors LnO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} (_Ln_ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) with the highest T_{c}\sim 10.6 K have been reported [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Both experimental and theoretical studies to date have indicated that the BiS_{2} layers play the role of the superconducting planes in these sulfide superconductors, similar to the CuO_{2} planes in the cuprate superconductors and the Fe_{2}_An_{2}_ (_An_ = P, As, Se, Te) layers in the iron-based superconductors [1, 2, 2].

A major challenge facing this new class of layered superconductors is to optimize T_{c} by exploring different spacer layers. Additionally, the effects of doping by either nonmagnetic or magnetic elements are important issues for investigation. To date, suppression of superconductivity has been observed in the case of Cu and Ag substitutions for Bi in the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} superconductor [13, 14], whereas coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been reported in the CeO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2}[15, 16] and Sr_{0.5}Ce_{0.5}FBiS_{2}[17] systems at low temperatures. However, none of these doping effects are fully understood.

Aiming at addressing the aforementioned issues, we report in this work our studies of 3d transition-metal substitutions for Bi in Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_A_ = Mn, Co, Ni; 0.075 \leqslant _x_\leqslant 0.15) compounds with conventional solid-state reaction. We first focus on the investigation of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} because these results are most interesting and reveal a possible record T_{c}\sim 15 K, and then perform comparative studies on Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_A_ = Co, Ni) in the Discussion section to elucidate the underlying physics. Based on our empirical findings, we suggest that the coexistence of superconductivity and long-range ferromagnetism in all Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_A_ = Mn, Co, Ni) compounds may be attributed to the selective doping of 3d transition-metal elements in the spacer Bi_{2}O_{2} layers, whereas the enhancement of T_{c} found only in Mn-doped samples may be due to substantial electron transfer from Mn^{4+}/Mn^{3+} substitutions in Bi_{2}O_{2} to the superconducting BiS_{2} layers.

## II Experiment

Bulk polycrystalline Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_x_ = 0.075, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15) and Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_A_ = Co, Ni; x = 0.1, 0.125)  samples were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. For the Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} samples, high purity Bi (99.99%), Bi_{2}O_{3} (99.99%), S (99.999%), MnO_{2} (99.99%) were first weighed in stoichiometric ratio and then grounded thoroughly in a glove box under high purity argon atmosphere. Next, the mixture was pressed into a pellet shape and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube (10^{-4} Torr). The pellet was then heated up to 510 ^{\circ}C and kept for 10 hours. After cooling the pellet to room temperature, the product was well mixed again by regrinding, pressed into a pellet shape, and then annealed at 510 ^{\circ}C for another 10 hours. The samples thus obtained appeared black in color and were hard. It is important to note that the sample may not be heated above 550 ^{\circ}C. Otherwise S-O gas would be produced and could result in explosion of the quartz tube [4]. Similar procedures were applied to the synthesis of the Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (A = Co, Ni; x = 0.1, 0.125) samples.

The crystal structures of all samples were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD, 18 kW D/MAX 2550) using the Cu-K_{\alpha} radiation. The lattice constants were calculated from the 2\theta values and the Miller indices by using the jade 6.5 software. After XRD studies, these polycrystalline samples were cut into rectangular shape and polished for electrical resistivity measurements. The electrical resistivity was measured with a standard four-terminal method covering temperature range from 3-300 K in a physical property measurement system (PPMS-9, Quantum Design, Inc.). Typical current densities used for the resistive measurements were \sim100 A/m^{2}. No apparent dependence on the current density was found up to \sim2000 A/m^{2}, whereas resistive signals became difficult to resolve for current densities significantly smaller than 100 A/m^{2}. The magnetization and specific heat measurements were conducted using the same PPMS with vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and specific heat options. The zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) of the magnetic susceptibility measurements of the samples were performed in the warming process. Additionally, the carrier densities of bulk polycrystalline samples were determined from their normal-state Hall coefficients at 300 K by means of the van der Pauw method and with the use of the Hall effect measurement system CVM200 made by the East Changing Company.

## III Results and Analysis

### Structural characterization

The XRD patterns of different Mn-doped samples and the corresponding crystalline structure are shown in Figs. 1(a)-1(b). These data suggest that all samples acquired the expected tetragonal phases (space group 14/mmm) with minor rhombohedra Bi_{2}S_{3} and Bi impurities, the latter being common occurrences in the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} system [4, 13, 14, 18] and exhibiting no superconductivity above 3 K [19, 20, 21]. The nominal Mn-doping (x) dependence of the lattice constants a and c are illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The general trend of decreasing lattice parameters with increasing Mn doping is reasonable because the ionic radii of Mn are much smaller than that of Bi^{3+}[22]. This trend is also indicative of successful incorporation of Mn ions into the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} unit cells. Similarly, XRD studies of Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (A = Co, Ni) also indicate that the lattice constants of Bi_{1-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} were all reduced relative to those of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Moreover, the lattice constants for different dopants followed the descending order of Co, Ni, and Mn, as explicitly shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c).

### _M-vs-T_ and _ρ-vs-T_ studies of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}

Temperature-dependent magnetization (M) of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} with x = 0.075, 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15 was studied under both zero-field-cool (ZFC) and field-cool (FC) conditions from 3-300 K and with an external field H = 1000Ge, as illustrated in Fig. 2. For each magnetization curve, three characteristic temperatures are noteworthy: The Neel temperature (T_{N}) near \sim125 K for x = 0.125 and 0.15, below which M decreased due to the onset of

  antiferromagnetism; the Curie temperature (T_{\text{Curie}}) near \sim50 K for all samples, below which a rapid upturn followed by saturation in the FC magnetization curves appeared, suggesting the formation of long-range ferromagnetism; and the temperature T_{c,M}\sim 4.5 K below which rapid decrease in magnetization occurred as the result of supercurrent-induced diamagnetism. Additionally, we note the dramatic contrasts between the ZFC and FC magnetization curves for T_{c,M}<T<T_{\text{Curie}} in all samples: The ZFC curves all exhibited an initial upturn of magnetization, signaling the onset of ferromagnetism, which was followed by gradual decrease and then a sharp downturn in magnetization. Interestingly, both the diamagnetic contribution in the ZFC curve and the magnitude of ferromagnetism in the FC curve increased with increasing x.

To better understand the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity, we conducted measurements of resistivity (\rho) vs T on Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}. As shown in Fig. 3(a), all samples reached zero resistance at low temperatures. On the other hand, the resistivity of samples with lower Mn-doping levels (x=0.075, 0.10) exhibited monotonic temperature dependence up to 150 K, whereas a resistive upturn [23] appeared at \sim55 K and \sim23 K for higher Mn-doping levels x=0.125 and 0.15, respectively. Given the highly anisotropic, layered nature of these BiS_{2}-based compounds, the physical origin for this doping-dependent resistive upturn cannot be fully uncovered without the availability of single crystalline materials. Nonetheless, a feasible mechanism that contributes to the resistive upturn is the occurrence of Kondo resonance at T<T_{K}, where T_{K} denotes the Kondo temperature. In this scenario, a lower T_{K} for a sample with a higher Mn-doping level would be consistent with stronger ferromagnetism and a sharper Kondo resonance of a linewidth \simT_{K}[23]. Moreover, the formation of Kondo clouds below T_{K} could help screen localized magnetic moments and so would be important to the appearance of singlet superconductivity at T_{c}<T_{K}[24]. However, the onset temperature T_{c,\rho} for rapid decrease in resistivity did not exhibit strong doping dependence [Figs. 3(a)-3(b)], and the T_{c,\rho} values for all doping levels were generally higher than T_{c,M}, the onset temperature for rapid ZFC and FC magnetization decrease, although both T_{c,\rho} and T_{c,M} followed a similar nonmonotonic trend [Figs. 3(c)-3(d)]. Given the complex conduction paths and magnetic domain structures in typical polycrystalline samples, the doping-dependent resistive upturn above T_{c} may be in part but cannot be entirely attributed to the occurrence of Kondo resonance.

Generally speaking, the T_{c,M} values determined from the onset of rapid FC magnetization decrease could not be representative of the intrinsic superconducting transition, because the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity would obscure the onset of the Meissner effect. Similarly, the polycrystalline nature of our Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} samples could significantly reduce the T_{c,\rho} values below the intrinsic superconducting transition temperature T_{c} because of the intergranular weak-link effects [25]. Hence, additional thermodynamic measurements of M-vs-H at T<T_{\text{Curie}} and specific heat (C)-vs-T studies in both zero and finite magnetic fields were necessary to unravel the true T_{c} values of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}.

Here we note slight resistive anomalies near T_{N} and T_{\text{Curie}} for x=0.15. The inset is the enlargement of the lower temperature regime for x=0.125 and 0.15, showing Kondo-like resistive upturn at T\sim 55 K for x=0.125 and at T\sim 23 K for x=0.15.

For each magnetization curve, three characteristic temperatures are noteworthy: The Néel temperature (T_{N}) near \sim125 K for x=0.075, 0.10, and 0.125; the Curie temperature (T_{\text{Curie}}) near \sim50 K; and the magnetization-determined superconducting transition temperature (T_{c,M}). The inset shows an expansion of the main panel over the temperature range where strong contrasts appear between the ZFC and FC curves.

  

### _M_-vs-_H_ studies of Bi4-_x_A_A_O4S3

In Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) we show the hysteretic _M_-vs-_H_ loops for x = 0.125 at low and high temperatures, respectively. Specifically, the low-temperature behavior in Fig. 4(a) with T = 3, 7, 12, and 14 K refers to the appearance of anomalous features associated with each magnetic hysteresis loop. These features diminished with increasing T. In contrast, the high-temperature behavior as manifested in Fig. 4(b) for the _M_-vs-_H_ loop at T = 20 K reveals a standard magnetic hysteresis loop for a ferromagnetic material. We attribute the difference between the low- and high-temperature behaviors to the onset of superconductivity in the former. Specifically, we consider a standard although much smaller superconducting magnetization loop [26] superposed on top of the ferromagnetic hysteretic loop. Both the isothermal ascending and descending branches of the _M_-vs-_H_ loop at T < _T__{c} would deviate from the typical ferromagnetic hysteresis loop due to the presence of supercurrents. Hence, by considering the derivative _dM_/_dH_ of either the ascending or descending branch of the _M_-vs-_H_ curve at a constant T, we expect one peak associated with the inflection point of a standard ferromagnetic _M_-vs-_H_ curve at _T__{c} < _T__{c} < _T__{Curie}. In contrast, an additional peak in the _dM_/_dH_-vs-_H_ curve is expected near H = 0 for T < _T__{c} because of the appearance of supercurrents [26], which is indeed confirmed by the data shown in Fig. 4(c).

We may define the magnetic field difference between the two peaks in _dM_/_dH_ as \Delta H^{*}(T), which is a measure of the supercurrent [26]. Therefore, we expect \Delta H^{*}(T) to decrease with increasing T and vanish at T > ~ _T__{c}, which is consistent with the empirical finding shown in Fig. 4(d), where \Delta H^{*}(T) approaches 0 at T = (16 \pm 2) K for x = 0.125. Similar behavior has also been confirmed for x = 0.10 and 0.15, as shown in Figs. 5(a)-5(d). These results suggest that T_{c}\sim(16\pm 2) K for x = 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15, whereas the \Delta H^{*} values from the _dM_/_dH_ curves for x = 0.075 have been difficult to determine due to significantly smaller _M_-vs-_H_ loops.

Our attribution of the anomalies in _M_-vs-_H_ loops of Bi4-3Mn,O4S3 to superconductivity can be further corroborated by studies of the _M_-vs-_H_ loops of a related system Bi4-4Co,O4S3 with x = 0.125. As we shall elaborate further in Sec. IV, the Bi3,875Co0.125O4S3 compound is also a superconductor with _T__{c}\sim 4.8 K and long-range ferromagnetism at low temperatures. Therefore, the _M_-vs-_H_ loops of Bi3,875Co0.125O4S3 also revealed anomalies induced by superconducting persistent currents at _T__{c} < _T__{c}, as shown in Fig. 6(a). On the other hand, the ferromagnetism in Bi3,875Co0.125O4S3 was much weaker than that of Bi4-4Mn3O4S3 (to be detailed in Sec. IV) so that the superconducting contributions in the _M_-vs-_H_ loops could be much better revealed. As exemplified in Fig. 6(b), the _M_-vs-_H_ loop of Bi3,875Co0.125O4S3 taken at T = 3 K < _T__{c}\sim 4.8 K could be decomposed into the superposition of a ferromagnetic loop and a superconducting loop. Moreover, we note that the superconducting contribution

These features are more pronounced at low T, and diminish with increasing T. (b) _M_-vs-_H_ curve for T = 20 K, which is consistent with a standard hysteresis loop for ferromagnets. (c) The ascending branches of (_dM_/_dH_)-vs-_H_ curves at T = 3, 7, 12, 14, and 20 K, respectively for x = 0.125, showing double-peak features for T ≤ 14 K and a single-peak feature at T = 20 K. The magnetic field difference between the double-peak features of each (_dM_/_dH_)-vs-_H_ curve is defined as \Delta H^{*}. (d) \Delta H^{*}-vs-_T_ data for x = 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15. The \Delta H^{*} values for all samples were found to approach zero at T = (16 \pm 2) K \sim _T__{c}. The nearly doping-independent _T__{c} may result from competing effects of increasing carrier densities and ferromagnetism.

 thus derived from the M-vs-H data of Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{x}S_{3} was in good agreement with the total M-vs-H loop found in the nonmagnetic, superconducting parent compound Bi_{4}O_{x}S_{3}[27]. These results therefore reaffirmed our notion that the hysteretic M-vs-H loops of Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{x}S_{3} (A = Mn, Co, Ni) consisted of contributions from both superconductivity and ferromagnetism.

### _C_-vs-T studies of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3}

To further verify the intrinsic T_{c} values of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3}, we conducted specific heat (_C_) studies on these samples. The measurements were carried out at both H = 0 (black) and H = 7T (red), and the resulting (dC/dT)-vs-T curves for all doping levels x = 0.075, 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15 are respectively illustrated in Figs. 7(a)-7(d) and further detailed in Figs. 7(e)-7(h). We find that a sharp and asymmetric feature appeared near T\sim 15 K for all curves taken at H = 0. If we attribute the temperature where maximum dC/dT appeared to T_{c}, the T_{c} values were found to be nearly doping independent (T_{c}\sim 15 K), consistent with the results obtained from the dM/dH studies in Figs. 4 and 5. This finding of T_{c}\sim 15 K is the highest superconducting transition temperature reported to date among the BiS_{2}-based superconductors.

We further note that the peak position of each (dC/dT) curve taken at H = 7 T exhibited a small (0.3 \sim 0.5 K) downshift relative to that taken at H = 0 [Figs. 7(e)-7(h)], and the peak height also diminished with magnetic field. The small downshift of the peak position at H = 7 T is suggestive of a relatively strong upper critical field H_{c2}(0). Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory [28] for the upper critical field, we find that the formula H_{c2}(0) = -0.69T_{c}[dH_{c2}(T)/dT]_{T_{c}} for T\rightarrowT_{c}^{-} yields H_{c2}(0) values in the range of 145 \sim 240 T if we take T_{c} = 15 K.

Although the errors for these H_{c2}(0) estimates are likely significant because of our limited specific heat data, we note that the H_{c2}(0) value of the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{x}S_{3} with T_{c} = 4.5 K was \sim21 T [4], suggesting that a relatively large H_{c2}(0) value (on the order of \sim10^{2} T) for T_{c}\sim 15 K could be reasonable if the slope |dH_{c2}(T)/dT|_{T_{c}} of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3} was comparable to or even larger than that of the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{x}S_{3}. On the other hand, in contrast to the studies of nonmagnetic Bi_{4}O_{x}S_{3}[4], the H_{c2}(0) values of magnetic Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3} could not be directly derived from the standard field-dependent resistive measurements due to the absence of H-dependent resistive transitions near T_{c}\sim 15 K and the fact that the WHH theory is only applicable to studies near T_{c}. Ultimately, better determination of the H_{c2}(0) values of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3} will rely on future availability of single crystalline materials, particularly given the highly anisotropic nature of these layered superconductors.

The hysteretic loops in the main panel reveal sharp anomalies, whereas those in the inset are consistent with typical ferromagnetic hysteretic loops. (b) The M-vs-H loop at T = 3 K in (a) can be decomposed into a ferromagnetic (green) and a superconducting (red) hysteretic loops from theoretical simulations.

The measurements were carried out for H = 0 (black) and H = 7T (red). For each doping level, a sharp feature appears near T\sim 15 K. Taking the temperature where dC/dT reaches maximum as T_{c}, we identify the T_{c} value (in units of K) for each doping level from (a)–(d) and (e)–(h). The T_{c} values (\sim15 K) were comparable within experimental error for all samples in H = 0, similar to the findings shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, slight downshifts (\sim0.3 K) can be found for all samples under H = 7 T, which is suggestive of a large upper critical field H_{c2}, as discussed in the text.

  

## IV IV. Discussion

Possible physical origin for enhanced superconductivity and coexisting ferromagnetism in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}

The observation of both enhanced superconductivity and long-range ferromagnetism in the Mn-doped Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} samples may be associated with the unique location and valences of the Mn ions in the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} compound. First, Mn ions may be preferentially located in the Bi_{2}O_{2} spacers rather than in the BiS_{2} layers so that severe lattice distortion from the large size differences between the Bi and Mn ions can be prevented in the superconducting BiS_{2} layers. Additionally, XPS studies on Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} revealed that the valences of Mn ions are found to be 3+ and 4+ [Fig. 8(a)]. The substitution of Mn^{4+} for Bi^{3+} would result in excess electron doping and contribute to the electronic density of states at the Fermi level in the electron-type Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} superconducting system, thus enhancing T_{c}.

The aforementioned conjecture of increased electronic carrier densities from Mn doping to the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} compound has indeed been corroborated by our Hall effect measurements of both pure Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} samples. Specifically, the Hall effect measurements were carried out at 300 K with an applied magnetic field H=0.483 T and an applied current I=10 mA, and the Hall resistivity for each sample was obtained by averaging readings from multiple measurements on different contact positions of the sample via the van der Pauw method. For the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, the normal-state Hall coefficient R_{H} was found to be (1.302\pm 0.005)\times 10^{-4} m^{3}C^{-1}, which corresponded to a bulk carrier density of n=(6.056\pm 0.028)\times 10^{22} m^{-3}. In contrast, for Mn-doped samples Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} with x=0.125, the normal-state Hall coefficient was found to be R_{H}=(3.716\pm 0.243)\times 10^{-5} m^{3}C^{-1}, which yielded a bulk carrier density n=(1.688\pm 0.120)\times 10^{23} m^{-3}, more than 2.5 times that of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.

It is also interesting to note that the correlation between enhanced superconductivity and increased electron carrier densities in the BiS_{2}-based superconductors has also been observed in the La_{1-x}_{M}OBiS_{2} (M= Th, Hf, Zr, Ti) system, [29] where substitutions of tetravalent Th^{4+}, Hf^{4+}, Zr^{4+}, and Ti^{4+} ions for trivalent La^{3+} could induce superconductivity with T_{c} up to 2.85 K while substitutions of divalent Sr^{2+} for La^{3+} could not yield superconductivity.

In addition to the effect of contributing excess carrier densities in the superconducting BiS_{2} layers, magnetic Mn ions could give rise to long-range ferromagnetism in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} without directly affecting the Cooper pairing within the BiS_{2} layers at T\ll T_{K} if they were confined within the Bi_{2}O_{2} spacer layers and coupled via the RKKY interaction [30, 31, 32]. Furthermore, the significant energy separation between the localized 3d orbitals responsible for magnetism and the Fermi level within the itinerant 6p orbitals for superconductivity also provides a favorable condition for coexisting superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}. In this context, we speculate that the observation of coexisting ferromagnetism and superconductivity in CeO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} and Sr_{0.5}Ce_{0.5}FeBiS_{2} compounds [15, 16, 17] may also be attributed to the confinement of magnetic moments in the CeO_{1-x}F_{x} and Sr_{1-x}Ce_{x}F spacer layers.

(b) Analysis of the XPS data of Bi_{3.875}Ni_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3}, showing the valence of Ni being Ni^{3+} (primary), metallic Ni, and Ni^{2+} (secondary) [38]. The presence of minor metallic peaks suggested that a small fraction of Ni was not fully doped into Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. (c) Analysis of the XPS data of Bi_{3.875}Co_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3}, showing the valences of Co-ions being metallic Co (primary) and Co^{2+} (secondary) [39], suggesting that Co was not fully doped into Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, similar to the situation encountered in Ni-doped samples.

 In principle, the location of Mn ions in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} may be identified by applying the Rietveld method to analyze the x-ray diffraction spectra [33]. However, our attempts of using the Rietveld refinement could not conclude that Mn ions only substituted Bi ions in the Bi_{2}O_{2} layers because of too many fitting parameters. Future x-ray or neutron scattering experiments on single crystalline materials would be the best approach to conclusively determine the position of the doped Mn ions.

Our conjecture of Cooper-pairing preservation in the BiS_{2} layers from the influence of adjacent ferromagnetic spacers is analogous to the findings in cuprate superconductivity, where substitutions of strong magnetic moments (such as Gd, Eu, and Sm) in layers other than the CuO_{2} planes do not result in noticeable degradation of superconductivity [34, 35, 36]. On the other hand, the significantly suppressed T_{c,\rho} relative to T_{c} in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} is likely due to the weak-link nature and ferromagnetic domain-induced superconducting phase fluctuations in these polycrystalline samples.

Finally, we note that the large H_{c2}(0) value estimated from our specific heat data also implies that the Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} system can support superconductivity under substantially large effective magnetic fields, whether the fields are from external sources or due to local magnetic moments. The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism could also result in stronger superconducting fluctuations and contribute to a larger upper critical field. This interplay of superconductivity and ferromagnetism on the magnitude of the upper critical field of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} is an interesting issue worthy of further theoretical investigation.

Comparative studies of Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{4-x}Ni_{x}O_{4}S_{3}

We have also investigated the effects of other 3d transition-metal doping on Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, and found that ferromagnetism also coexists with superconductivity for Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{4-x}Ni_{x}O_{4}S_{3} with x=0.1 and 0.125. As exemplified in Fig. 1(c), XRD studies indicated that the lattice constants of Bi_{1.875}Co_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{1.875}Ni_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} were all reduced relative to those of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, similar to the findings from Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} [Fig. 1(a)]. The T_{c,\rho} and T_{c,M} values only exhibited small variations from those of the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, as shown in Figs. 9(a)-9(d). On the other hand, the positive saturation magnetizations in the FC curves for both Bi_{3.875}Co_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{3.875}Ni_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} were smaller than that of Bi_{1.875}Mn_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} (Fig. 10), whereas the corresponding ZFC curves remain positive at all temperatures, in stark contrast to the strong diamagnetism developed in {\rm Si}_{3.875}Mn_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} at T<40 K (Fig. 2). Moreover, no enhancement of superconductivity relative to the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} was found in either Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{4}S_{3} or Bi_{4-x}Ni_{x}O_{4}S_{3} so that anomalies associated with superconductivity in the M-vs-H loops completely vanished at T>T_{c}=4.8 K, as exemplified in Figs. 6(a)-6(b) for Bi_{3.875}Co_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3}.

XPS studies of Bi_{4-x}Ni_{x}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{4}S_{3} [Figs. 8(b)-8(c)] further revealed that the valences of Ni

(b) Comparison of the \rho-vs-T data at low temperatures (up to T=12 K) for different 3d transition-metal substitutions. (c) Comparison of the low-temperature (up to T=10 K) ZFC M-vs-T data for different 3d transition-metal substitutions. (d) Comparison of the T_{c,\rho} and T_{c,M} values for different 3d transition-metal substitutions in Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. We note that the T_{c,\rho} values exhibit anti-correlation with the lattice constants shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c).

  ions were either 2+ or 3+ and that of Co ions was purely 2+, in contrast to the 3+ and 4+ valences of Mn ions in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} [Fig. 8(a)]. These comparisons suggest that the unique 4+ valence of Mn ions may play an important role in the enhanced superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} by contributing excess conducting electrons to the superconducting BiS_{2} layers while retaining localized magnetic moments in the Bi_{2}O_{2} spacer layers. The onset of diamagnetic signals at T<\sim 40 K in the ZFC magnetization curves of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (Fig. 2 and Fig. 10) further provides a tantalizing hint for reaching even higher-T_{c} values in the BiS_{2}-based superconductors.

## V Conclusion

We have demonstrated in this work thermodynamic evidences for enhanced superconductivity and its coexistence with ferromagnetism in Mn-doped layered superconductors, Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (0.075 \leqslantx\leqslant 0.15). Our studies suggest that the robustness of superconductivity against ferromagnetism in these BiS_{2}-based superconductors may be attributed to the layered structure and the significant energy separation between the localized 3d orbitals responsible for magnetism and the Fermi level within the 6p orbitals for superconductivity. In particular, Mn doping induces an enhancement of T_{c} from 4.5 K up to \sim15 K, whereas comparable doping of Ni and Co reveals only coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism without discernible enhancement in T_{c} relative to Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. We attribute the unique T_{c} enhancement in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} to the Mn^{4+}/Mn^{3+} mixed valences that contribute excess electrons to the superconducting BiS_{2} layers, which has been further corroborated by the Hall effect studies. These findings have therefore revealed new pathways to enhancing the T_{c} of BiS_{2}-based layered superconductors. However, complete elucidation of the microscopic mechanism and the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in the BiS_{2}-based superconductors still awaits future development of single crystalline materials.

###### Abstract

We demonstrate that Mn doping in the layered sulfides Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} leads to stable Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} compounds that exhibit both long-range ferromagnetism and enhanced superconductivity for 0.075 \leqslant _x_\leqslant 0.15, with a possible record superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) \sim15 K among all Bi_{2}-based superconductors. We conjecture that the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism may be attributed to Mn doping in the spacer Bi_{2}O_{2} layers away from the superconducting BiS_{2} layers, whereas the enhancement of T_{c} may be due to excess electron transfer to BiS_{2} from the Mn^{4+}/Mn^{3+} substitutions in Bi_{2}O_{2}. This notion is empirically corroborated by the increased electron-carrier densities upon Mn doping, and by further studies of the Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} compounds (_A_ = Co, Ni; x = 0.1, 0.125), where the T_{c} values remain comparable to that of the undoped Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} system (\sim4.5 K) due to lack of 4+ valences in either Co or Ni ions for excess electron transfer to the BiS_{2} layers. These findings therefore shed new light on feasible pathways to enhance the T_{c} values of BiS_{2}-based superconductors, although complete elucidation of the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in these anisotropic layered compounds awaits the development of single crystalline materials for further investigation.

## I Introduction

One of the commonalities among the cuprate and iron-based high-temperature superconductors is their layered structures [1, 2]. Interestingly, even for conventional superconductors, the highest superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) has been found in layered magnesium diboride MgB_{2}[3]. Recently, superconductivity with T_{c} = 4.5 K was discovered in a new superconductor Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}[4]. This compound has a layered structure composed of two superconducting BiS_{2} layers and spacer layers of Bi_{4}O_{4}(SO_{4})_{1-x}, where x indicates the deficiency of (SO_{4})^{2-} ions at the interlayer sites. Since the discovery of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, several other BiS_{2}-based superconductors LnO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} (_Ln_ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) with the highest T_{c}\sim 10.6 K have been reported [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Both experimental and theoretical studies to date have indicated that the BiS_{2} layers play the role of the superconducting planes in these sulfide superconductors, similar to the CuO_{2} planes in the cuprate superconductors and the Fe_{2}_An_{2}_ (_An_ = P, As, Se, Te) layers in the iron-based superconductors [1, 2, 2].

A major challenge facing this new class of layered superconductors is to optimize T_{c} by exploring different spacer layers. Additionally, the effects of doping by either nonmagnetic or magnetic elements are important issues for investigation. To date, suppression of superconductivity has been observed in the case of Cu and Ag substitutions for Bi in the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} superconductor [13, 14], whereas coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been reported in the CeO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2}[15, 16] and Sr_{0.5}Ce_{0.5}FBiS_{2}[17] systems at low temperatures. However, none of these doping effects are fully understood.

Aiming at addressing the aforementioned issues, we report in this work our studies of 3d transition-metal substitutions for Bi in Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_A_ = Mn, Co, Ni; 0.075 \leqslant _x_\leqslant 0.15) compounds with conventional solid-state reaction. We first focus on the investigation of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} because these results are most interesting and reveal a possible record T_{c}\sim 15 K, and then perform comparative studies on Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_A_ = Co, Ni) in the Discussion section to elucidate the underlying physics. Based on our empirical findings, we suggest that the coexistence of superconductivity and long-range ferromagnetism in all Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_A_ = Mn, Co, Ni) compounds may be attributed to the selective doping of 3d transition-metal elements in the spacer Bi_{2}O_{2} layers, whereas the enhancement of T_{c} found only in Mn-doped samples may be due to substantial electron transfer from Mn^{4+}/Mn^{3+} substitutions in Bi_{2}O_{2} to the superconducting BiS_{2} layers.

## II Experiment

Bulk polycrystalline Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_x_ = 0.075, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15) and Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (_A_ = Co, Ni; x = 0.1, 0.125)  samples were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. For the Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} samples, high purity Bi (99.99%), Bi_{2}O_{3} (99.99%), S (99.999%), MnO_{2} (99.99%) were first weighed in stoichiometric ratio and then grounded thoroughly in a glove box under high purity argon atmosphere. Next, the mixture was pressed into a pellet shape and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube (10^{-4} Torr). The pellet was then heated up to 510 ^{\circ}C and kept for 10 hours. After cooling the pellet to room temperature, the product was well mixed again by regrinding, pressed into a pellet shape, and then annealed at 510 ^{\circ}C for another 10 hours. The samples thus obtained appeared black in color and were hard. It is important to note that the sample may not be heated above 550 ^{\circ}C. Otherwise S-O gas would be produced and could result in explosion of the quartz tube [4]. Similar procedures were applied to the synthesis of the Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (A = Co, Ni; x = 0.1, 0.125) samples.

The crystal structures of all samples were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD, 18 kW D/MAX 2550) using the Cu-K_{\alpha} radiation. The lattice constants were calculated from the 2\theta values and the Miller indices by using the jade 6.5 software. After XRD studies, these polycrystalline samples were cut into rectangular shape and polished for electrical resistivity measurements. The electrical resistivity was measured with a standard four-terminal method covering temperature range from 3-300 K in a physical property measurement system (PPMS-9, Quantum Design, Inc.). Typical current densities used for the resistive measurements were \sim100 A/m^{2}. No apparent dependence on the current density was found up to \sim2000 A/m^{2}, whereas resistive signals became difficult to resolve for current densities significantly smaller than 100 A/m^{2}. The magnetization and specific heat measurements were conducted using the same PPMS with vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and specific heat options. The zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) of the magnetic susceptibility measurements of the samples were performed in the warming process. Additionally, the carrier densities of bulk polycrystalline samples were determined from their normal-state Hall coefficients at 300 K by means of the van der Pauw method and with the use of the Hall effect measurement system CVM200 made by the East Changing Company.

## III Results and Analysis

### Structural characterization

The XRD patterns of different Mn-doped samples and the corresponding crystalline structure are shown in Figs. 1(a)-1(b). These data suggest that all samples acquired the expected tetragonal phases (space group 14/mmm) with minor rhombohedra Bi_{2}S_{3} and Bi impurities, the latter being common occurrences in the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} system [4, 13, 14, 18] and exhibiting no superconductivity above 3 K [19, 20, 21]. The nominal Mn-doping (x) dependence of the lattice constants a and c are illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1(a). The general trend of decreasing lattice parameters with increasing Mn doping is reasonable because the ionic radii of Mn are much smaller than that of Bi^{3+}[22]. This trend is also indicative of successful incorporation of Mn ions into the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} unit cells. Similarly, XRD studies of Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (A = Co, Ni) also indicate that the lattice constants of Bi_{1-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} were all reduced relative to those of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Moreover, the lattice constants for different dopants followed the descending order of Co, Ni, and Mn, as explicitly shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c).

### _M-vs-T_ and _ρ-vs-T_ studies of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}

Temperature-dependent magnetization (M) of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} with x = 0.075, 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15 was studied under both zero-field-cool (ZFC) and field-cool (FC) conditions from 3-300 K and with an external field H = 1000Ge, as illustrated in Fig. 2. For each magnetization curve, three characteristic temperatures are noteworthy: The Neel temperature (T_{N}) near \sim125 K for x = 0.125 and 0.15, below which M decreased due to the onset of

  antiferromagnetism; the Curie temperature (T_{\text{Curie}}) near \sim50 K for all samples, below which a rapid upturn followed by saturation in the FC magnetization curves appeared, suggesting the formation of long-range ferromagnetism; and the temperature T_{c,M}\sim 4.5 K below which rapid decrease in magnetization occurred as the result of supercurrent-induced diamagnetism. Additionally, we note the dramatic contrasts between the ZFC and FC magnetization curves for T_{c,M}<T<T_{\text{Curie}} in all samples: The ZFC curves all exhibited an initial upturn of magnetization, signaling the onset of ferromagnetism, which was followed by gradual decrease and then a sharp downturn in magnetization. Interestingly, both the diamagnetic contribution in the ZFC curve and the magnitude of ferromagnetism in the FC curve increased with increasing x.

To better understand the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity, we conducted measurements of resistivity (\rho) vs T on Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}. As shown in Fig. 3(a), all samples reached zero resistance at low temperatures. On the other hand, the resistivity of samples with lower Mn-doping levels (x=0.075, 0.10) exhibited monotonic temperature dependence up to 150 K, whereas a resistive upturn [23] appeared at \sim55 K and \sim23 K for higher Mn-doping levels x=0.125 and 0.15, respectively. Given the highly anisotropic, layered nature of these BiS_{2}-based compounds, the physical origin for this doping-dependent resistive upturn cannot be fully uncovered without the availability of single crystalline materials. Nonetheless, a feasible mechanism that contributes to the resistive upturn is the occurrence of Kondo resonance at T<T_{K}, where T_{K} denotes the Kondo temperature. In this scenario, a lower T_{K} for a sample with a higher Mn-doping level would be consistent with stronger ferromagnetism and a sharper Kondo resonance of a linewidth \simT_{K}[23]. Moreover, the formation of Kondo clouds below T_{K} could help screen localized magnetic moments and so would be important to the appearance of singlet superconductivity at T_{c}<T_{K}[24]. However, the onset temperature T_{c,\rho} for rapid decrease in resistivity did not exhibit strong doping dependence [Figs. 3(a)-3(b)], and the T_{c,\rho} values for all doping levels were generally higher than T_{c,M}, the onset temperature for rapid ZFC and FC magnetization decrease, although both T_{c,\rho} and T_{c,M} followed a similar nonmonotonic trend [Figs. 3(c)-3(d)]. Given the complex conduction paths and magnetic domain structures in typical polycrystalline samples, the doping-dependent resistive upturn above T_{c} may be in part but cannot be entirely attributed to the occurrence of Kondo resonance.

Generally speaking, the T_{c,M} values determined from the onset of rapid FC magnetization decrease could not be representative of the intrinsic superconducting transition, because the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity would obscure the onset of the Meissner effect. Similarly, the polycrystalline nature of our Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} samples could significantly reduce the T_{c,\rho} values below the intrinsic superconducting transition temperature T_{c} because of the intergranular weak-link effects [25]. Hence, additional thermodynamic measurements of M-vs-H at T<T_{\text{Curie}} and specific heat (C)-vs-T studies in both zero and finite magnetic fields were necessary to unravel the true T_{c} values of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}.

For each magnetization curve, three characteristic temperatures are noteworthy: The Néel temperature (T_{N}) near \sim125 K for x=0.075, 0.10, and 0.125; the Curie temperature (T_{\text{Curie}}) near \sim50 K; and the magnetization-determined superconducting transition temperature (T_{c,M}). The inset shows an expansion of the main panel over the temperature range where strong contrasts appear between the ZFC and FC curves.

  

### _M_-vs-_H_ studies of Bi4-_x_A_A_O4S3

In Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) we show the hysteretic _M_-vs-_H_ loops for x = 0.125 at low and high temperatures, respectively. Specifically, the low-temperature behavior in Fig. 4(a) with T = 3, 7, 12, and 14 K refers to the appearance of anomalous features associated with each magnetic hysteresis loop. These features diminished with increasing T. In contrast, the high-temperature behavior as manifested in Fig. 4(b) for the _M_-vs-_H_ loop at T = 20 K reveals a standard magnetic hysteresis loop for a ferromagnetic material. We attribute the difference between the low- and high-temperature behaviors to the onset of superconductivity in the former. Specifically, we consider a standard although much smaller superconducting magnetization loop [26] superposed on top of the ferromagnetic hysteretic loop. Both the isothermal ascending and descending branches of the _M_-vs-_H_ loop at T < _T__{c} would deviate from the typical ferromagnetic hysteresis loop due to the presence of supercurrents. Hence, by considering the derivative _dM_/_dH_ of either the ascending or descending branch of the _M_-vs-_H_ curve at a constant T, we expect one peak associated with the inflection point of a standard ferromagnetic _M_-vs-_H_ curve at _T__{c} < _T__{c} < _T__{Curie}. In contrast, an additional peak in the _dM_/_dH_-vs-_H_ curve is expected near H = 0 for T < _T__{c} because of the appearance of supercurrents [26], which is indeed confirmed by the data shown in Fig. 4(c).

We may define the magnetic field difference between the two peaks in _dM_/_dH_ as \Delta H^{*}(T), which is a measure of the supercurrent [26]. Therefore, we expect \Delta H^{*}(T) to decrease with increasing T and vanish at T > ~ _T__{c}, which is consistent with the empirical finding shown in Fig. 4(d), where \Delta H^{*}(T) approaches 0 at T = (16 \pm 2) K for x = 0.125. Similar behavior has also been confirmed for x = 0.10 and 0.15, as shown in Figs. 5(a)-5(d). These results suggest that T_{c}\sim(16\pm 2) K for x = 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15, whereas the \Delta H^{*} values from the _dM_/_dH_ curves for x = 0.075 have been difficult to determine due to significantly smaller _M_-vs-_H_ loops.

Our attribution of the anomalies in _M_-vs-_H_ loops of Bi4-3Mn,O4S3 to superconductivity can be further corroborated by studies of the _M_-vs-_H_ loops of a related system Bi4-4Co,O4S3 with x = 0.125. As we shall elaborate further in Sec. IV, the Bi3,875Co0.125O4S3 compound is also a superconductor with _T__{c}\sim 4.8 K and long-range ferromagnetism at low temperatures. Therefore, the _M_-vs-_H_ loops of Bi3,875Co0.125O4S3 also revealed anomalies induced by superconducting persistent currents at _T__{c} < _T__{c}, as shown in Fig. 6(a). On the other hand, the ferromagnetism in Bi3,875Co0.125O4S3 was much weaker than that of Bi4-4Mn3O4S3 (to be detailed in Sec. IV) so that the superconducting contributions in the _M_-vs-_H_ loops could be much better revealed. As exemplified in Fig. 6(b), the _M_-vs-_H_ loop of Bi3,875Co0.125O4S3 taken at T = 3 K < _T__{c}\sim 4.8 K could be decomposed into the superposition of a ferromagnetic loop and a superconducting loop. Moreover, we note that the superconducting contribution

These features are more pronounced at low T, and diminish with increasing T. (b) _M_-vs-_H_ curve for T = 20 K, which is consistent with a standard hysteresis loop for ferromagnets. (c) The ascending branches of (_dM_/_dH_)-vs-_H_ curves at T = 3, 7, 12, 14, and 20 K, respectively for x = 0.125, showing double-peak features for T ≤ 14 K and a single-peak feature at T = 20 K. The magnetic field difference between the double-peak features of each (_dM_/_dH_)-vs-_H_ curve is defined as \Delta H^{*}. (d) \Delta H^{*}-vs-_T_ data for x = 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15. The \Delta H^{*} values for all samples were found to approach zero at T = (16 \pm 2) K \sim _T__{c}. The nearly doping-independent _T__{c} may result from competing effects of increasing carrier densities and ferromagnetism.

 thus derived from the M-vs-H data of Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{x}S_{3} was in good agreement with the total M-vs-H loop found in the nonmagnetic, superconducting parent compound Bi_{4}O_{x}S_{3}[27]. These results therefore reaffirmed our notion that the hysteretic M-vs-H loops of Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{x}S_{3} (A = Mn, Co, Ni) consisted of contributions from both superconductivity and ferromagnetism.

### _C_-vs-T studies of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3}

To further verify the intrinsic T_{c} values of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3}, we conducted specific heat (_C_) studies on these samples. The measurements were carried out at both H = 0 (black) and H = 7T (red), and the resulting (dC/dT)-vs-T curves for all doping levels x = 0.075, 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15 are respectively illustrated in Figs. 7(a)-7(d) and further detailed in Figs. 7(e)-7(h). We find that a sharp and asymmetric feature appeared near T\sim 15 K for all curves taken at H = 0. If we attribute the temperature where maximum dC/dT appeared to T_{c}, the T_{c} values were found to be nearly doping independent (T_{c}\sim 15 K), consistent with the results obtained from the dM/dH studies in Figs. 4 and 5. This finding of T_{c}\sim 15 K is the highest superconducting transition temperature reported to date among the BiS_{2}-based superconductors.

We further note that the peak position of each (dC/dT) curve taken at H = 7 T exhibited a small (0.3 \sim 0.5 K) downshift relative to that taken at H = 0 [Figs. 7(e)-7(h)], and the peak height also diminished with magnetic field. The small downshift of the peak position at H = 7 T is suggestive of a relatively strong upper critical field H_{c2}(0). Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory [28] for the upper critical field, we find that the formula H_{c2}(0) = -0.69T_{c}[dH_{c2}(T)/dT]_{T_{c}} for T\rightarrowT_{c}^{-} yields H_{c2}(0) values in the range of 145 \sim 240 T if we take T_{c} = 15 K.

Although the errors for these H_{c2}(0) estimates are likely significant because of our limited specific heat data, we note that the H_{c2}(0) value of the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{x}S_{3} with T_{c} = 4.5 K was \sim21 T [4], suggesting that a relatively large H_{c2}(0) value (on the order of \sim10^{2} T) for T_{c}\sim 15 K could be reasonable if the slope |dH_{c2}(T)/dT|_{T_{c}} of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3} was comparable to or even larger than that of the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{x}S_{3}. On the other hand, in contrast to the studies of nonmagnetic Bi_{4}O_{x}S_{3}[4], the H_{c2}(0) values of magnetic Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3} could not be directly derived from the standard field-dependent resistive measurements due to the absence of H-dependent resistive transitions near T_{c}\sim 15 K and the fact that the WHH theory is only applicable to studies near T_{c}. Ultimately, better determination of the H_{c2}(0) values of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{x}S_{3} will rely on future availability of single crystalline materials, particularly given the highly anisotropic nature of these layered superconductors.

The hysteretic loops in the main panel reveal sharp anomalies, whereas those in the inset are consistent with typical ferromagnetic hysteretic loops. (b) The M-vs-H loop at T = 3 K in (a) can be decomposed into a ferromagnetic (green) and a superconducting (red) hysteretic loops from theoretical simulations.

The measurements were carried out for H = 0 (black) and H = 7T (red). For each doping level, a sharp feature appears near T\sim 15 K. Taking the temperature where dC/dT reaches maximum as T_{c}, we identify the T_{c} value (in units of K) for each doping level from (a)–(d) and (e)–(h). The T_{c} values (\sim15 K) were comparable within experimental error for all samples in H = 0, similar to the findings shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, slight downshifts (\sim0.3 K) can be found for all samples under H = 7 T, which is suggestive of a large upper critical field H_{c2}, as discussed in the text.

  

## IV IV. Discussion

Possible physical origin for enhanced superconductivity and coexisting ferromagnetism in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}

The observation of both enhanced superconductivity and long-range ferromagnetism in the Mn-doped Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} samples may be associated with the unique location and valences of the Mn ions in the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} compound. First, Mn ions may be preferentially located in the Bi_{2}O_{2} spacers rather than in the BiS_{2} layers so that severe lattice distortion from the large size differences between the Bi and Mn ions can be prevented in the superconducting BiS_{2} layers. Additionally, XPS studies on Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} revealed that the valences of Mn ions are found to be 3+ and 4+ [Fig. 8(a)]. The substitution of Mn^{4+} for Bi^{3+} would result in excess electron doping and contribute to the electronic density of states at the Fermi level in the electron-type Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} superconducting system, thus enhancing T_{c}.

The aforementioned conjecture of increased electronic carrier densities from Mn doping to the Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} compound has indeed been corroborated by our Hall effect measurements of both pure Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} samples. Specifically, the Hall effect measurements were carried out at 300 K with an applied magnetic field H=0.483 T and an applied current I=10 mA, and the Hall resistivity for each sample was obtained by averaging readings from multiple measurements on different contact positions of the sample via the van der Pauw method. For the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, the normal-state Hall coefficient R_{H} was found to be (1.302\pm 0.005)\times 10^{-4} m^{3}C^{-1}, which corresponded to a bulk carrier density of n=(6.056\pm 0.028)\times 10^{22} m^{-3}. In contrast, for Mn-doped samples Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} with x=0.125, the normal-state Hall coefficient was found to be R_{H}=(3.716\pm 0.243)\times 10^{-5} m^{3}C^{-1}, which yielded a bulk carrier density n=(1.688\pm 0.120)\times 10^{23} m^{-3}, more than 2.5 times that of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}.

It is also interesting to note that the correlation between enhanced superconductivity and increased electron carrier densities in the BiS_{2}-based superconductors has also been observed in the La_{1-x}_{M}OBiS_{2} (M= Th, Hf, Zr, Ti) system, [29] where substitutions of tetravalent Th^{4+}, Hf^{4+}, Zr^{4+}, and Ti^{4+} ions for trivalent La^{3+} could induce superconductivity with T_{c} up to 2.85 K while substitutions of divalent Sr^{2+} for La^{3+} could not yield superconductivity.

In addition to the effect of contributing excess carrier densities in the superconducting BiS_{2} layers, magnetic Mn ions could give rise to long-range ferromagnetism in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} without directly affecting the Cooper pairing within the BiS_{2} layers at T\ll T_{K} if they were confined within the Bi_{2}O_{2} spacer layers and coupled via the RKKY interaction [30, 31, 32]. Furthermore, the significant energy separation between the localized 3d orbitals responsible for magnetism and the Fermi level within the itinerant 6p orbitals for superconductivity also provides a favorable condition for coexisting superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3}. In this context, we speculate that the observation of coexisting ferromagnetism and superconductivity in CeO_{1-x}F_{x}BiS_{2} and Sr_{0.5}Ce_{0.5}FeBiS_{2} compounds [15, 16, 17] may also be attributed to the confinement of magnetic moments in the CeO_{1-x}F_{x} and Sr_{1-x}Ce_{x}F spacer layers.

(b) Analysis of the XPS data of Bi_{3.875}Ni_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3}, showing the valence of Ni being Ni^{3+} (primary), metallic Ni, and Ni^{2+} (secondary) [38]. The presence of minor metallic peaks suggested that a small fraction of Ni was not fully doped into Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. (c) Analysis of the XPS data of Bi_{3.875}Co_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3}, showing the valences of Co-ions being metallic Co (primary) and Co^{2+} (secondary) [39], suggesting that Co was not fully doped into Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, similar to the situation encountered in Ni-doped samples.

 In principle, the location of Mn ions in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} may be identified by applying the Rietveld method to analyze the x-ray diffraction spectra [33]. However, our attempts of using the Rietveld refinement could not conclude that Mn ions only substituted Bi ions in the Bi_{2}O_{2} layers because of too many fitting parameters. Future x-ray or neutron scattering experiments on single crystalline materials would be the best approach to conclusively determine the position of the doped Mn ions.

Our conjecture of Cooper-pairing preservation in the BiS_{2} layers from the influence of adjacent ferromagnetic spacers is analogous to the findings in cuprate superconductivity, where substitutions of strong magnetic moments (such as Gd, Eu, and Sm) in layers other than the CuO_{2} planes do not result in noticeable degradation of superconductivity [34, 35, 36]. On the other hand, the significantly suppressed T_{c,\rho} relative to T_{c} in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} is likely due to the weak-link nature and ferromagnetic domain-induced superconducting phase fluctuations in these polycrystalline samples.

Finally, we note that the large H_{c2}(0) value estimated from our specific heat data also implies that the Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} system can support superconductivity under substantially large effective magnetic fields, whether the fields are from external sources or due to local magnetic moments. The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism could also result in stronger superconducting fluctuations and contribute to a larger upper critical field. This interplay of superconductivity and ferromagnetism on the magnitude of the upper critical field of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} is an interesting issue worthy of further theoretical investigation.

Comparative studies of Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{4-x}Ni_{x}O_{4}S_{3}

We have also investigated the effects of other 3d transition-metal doping on Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, and found that ferromagnetism also coexists with superconductivity for Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{4-x}Ni_{x}O_{4}S_{3} with x=0.1 and 0.125. As exemplified in Fig. 1(c), XRD studies indicated that the lattice constants of Bi_{1.875}Co_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{1.875}Ni_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} were all reduced relative to those of Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, similar to the findings from Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} [Fig. 1(a)]. The T_{c,\rho} and T_{c,M} values only exhibited small variations from those of the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}, as shown in Figs. 9(a)-9(d). On the other hand, the positive saturation magnetizations in the FC curves for both Bi_{3.875}Co_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{3.875}Ni_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} were smaller than that of Bi_{1.875}Mn_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} (Fig. 10), whereas the corresponding ZFC curves remain positive at all temperatures, in stark contrast to the strong diamagnetism developed in {\rm Si}_{3.875}Mn_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} at T<40 K (Fig. 2). Moreover, no enhancement of superconductivity relative to the parent compound Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} was found in either Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{4}S_{3} or Bi_{4-x}Ni_{x}O_{4}S_{3} so that anomalies associated with superconductivity in the M-vs-H loops completely vanished at T>T_{c}=4.8 K, as exemplified in Figs. 6(a)-6(b) for Bi_{3.875}Co_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3}.

XPS studies of Bi_{4-x}Ni_{x}O_{4}S_{3} and Bi_{4-x}Co_{x}O_{4}S_{3} [Figs. 8(b)-8(c)] further revealed that the valences of Ni

(d) Comparison of the T_{c,\rho} and T_{c,M} values for different 3d transition-metal substitutions in Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. We note that the T_{c,\rho} values exhibit anti-correlation with the lattice constants shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c).

  ions were either 2+ or 3+ and that of Co ions was purely 2+, in contrast to the 3+ and 4+ valences of Mn ions in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} [Fig. 8(a)]. These comparisons suggest that the unique 4+ valence of Mn ions may play an important role in the enhanced superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} by contributing excess conducting electrons to the superconducting BiS_{2} layers while retaining localized magnetic moments in the Bi_{2}O_{2} spacer layers. The onset of diamagnetic signals at T<\sim 40 K in the ZFC magnetization curves of Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (Fig. 2 and Fig. 10) further provides a tantalizing hint for reaching even higher-T_{c} values in the BiS_{2}-based superconductors.

## V Conclusion

We have demonstrated in this work thermodynamic evidences for enhanced superconductivity and its coexistence with ferromagnetism in Mn-doped layered superconductors, Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (0.075 \leqslantx\leqslant 0.15). Our studies suggest that the robustness of superconductivity against ferromagnetism in these BiS_{2}-based superconductors may be attributed to the layered structure and the significant energy separation between the localized 3d orbitals responsible for magnetism and the Fermi level within the 6p orbitals for superconductivity. In particular, Mn doping induces an enhancement of T_{c} from 4.5 K up to \sim15 K, whereas comparable doping of Ni and Co reveals only coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism without discernible enhancement in T_{c} relative to Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3}. We attribute the unique T_{c} enhancement in Bi_{4-x}Mn_{x}O_{4}S_{3} to the Mn^{4+}/Mn^{3+} mixed valences that contribute excess electrons to the superconducting BiS_{2} layers, which has been further corroborated by the Hall effect studies. These findings have therefore revealed new pathways to enhancing the T_{c} of BiS_{2}-based layered superconductors. However, complete elucidation of the microscopic mechanism and the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in the BiS_{2}-based superconductors still awaits future development of single crystalline materials.

Figure 10: ZFC and FC M-vs-T data of Bi_{4-x}A_{x}O_{4}S_{3} (A = Co, Ni, Mn and x = 0.125): The ZFC M-vs–T curves for samples doped with Co and Ni always revealed positive magnetization except when T< 4.5 K, whereas their FC M-vs-T curves all exhibited strong increase in magnetization, suggesting the presence of long-range ferromagnetism. In contrast, only the ZFC M-vs-T curve for the Mn-doped sample Bi_{3.875}Mn_{0.125}O_{4}S_{3} exhibited diamagnetism for T< 40 K whereas the FC M-vs-T curve also revealed strong enhancement of positive magnetization below 50 K, suggesting the appearance of long-range ferromagnetism.
