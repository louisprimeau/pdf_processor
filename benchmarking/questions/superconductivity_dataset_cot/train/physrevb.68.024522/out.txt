###### Abstract

We report that the two distinct superconducting phases of CeCu_{2}Si_{2} with a slightly different T_{c} revealed an opposite pressure dependence of T_{c} and quite a different normal state at low temperatures; a strongly T-dependent C_{p}/T peaking around 0.6 K for the high-T_{c} phase as contrasted with a very weak T dependence for the other. The superconducting C_{p}, however, exhibited a quadratic T dependence above 0.2 K and below \sim 0.1 K in both phases. We herein speculate that these two superconducting states might be due to a different pairing mechanism or symmetry.

Ever since the discovery of the first heavy-electron superconductor CeCu_{2}Si_{2}, [1] various types of superconducting f-electron systems like UPt_{3}, UBe_{13}, [2] UPd_{2}Al_{3}, [3] and CeCoIn_{5} (Ref. [4]) have become known. It has been furthermore disclosed that antiferromagnets like CePd_{2}Si_{2} (Ref. [5]) and even a ferromagnet like UGe_{2} (Ref. [6]) exhibit superconductivity under pressure at fairly low temperatures. These experimental findings have naturally generated a great deal of theoretical interest and investigations concerning superconducting pairing mechanism in such f-electron systems subjected to a supposedly strong Coulomb repulsion. [7, 8] Although any successful interpretation has unfortunately not been put forward for most of them due to both experimental and theoretical difficulties, UPt_{3} has recently been claimed as an odd-parity superconductor from a Knight shift study. [9]

CeCu_{2}Si_{2} is not an exception either and the true nature of the earliest heavy-electron superconductor has not been clarified yet despite of enormous efforts, particularly made by Steglich's group since the discovery. [10] There still remain many unsolved problems about this compound. In order to clarify how the superconducting phase emerges by changing the composition we have reinvestigated the compound by preparing homogeneous polycrystalline samples at many different compositions, and recently reported that there exist two distinct superconducting states with only a slightly different T_{c} (0.6 and 0.7 K) located side by side in the homogeneity range. [11, 12] A more careful reanalysis of their low-temperature data has strongly implied that these two superconducting states may belong to different symmetries of a superconducting pairing state which are derived from a quite dissimilar normal state. The normal states have been revealed upon destroying the superconductivity by sufficiently strong magnetic fields of about 2.5 T. The low-T_{c} phase with a slightly excess copper demonstrated an almost-temperature-independent C_{p}/T(\equiv\gamma), while the high-T_{c} phase closer to the stoichiometric composition demonstrated a strongly T-dependent \gamma peaking around 0.55 K. It is interesting to note here that each of these superconducting states seems to keep its identity without merging in spite of the small difference in the condensation energy or T_{c} and the intimate proximity of the composition (only at most 0.25 at. % apart). This fact may be due to a microscopic origin like an abrupt change of the Fermi surface. It is a very rare case in which two different superconducting phases appear side by side in the supposedly uniform homogeneity field of the identical crystal structure of a tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2} type. It must be further noted that the high-T_{c} superconducting phase is derived from a normal state located in a region of antiferromagnetic instability, where the weak magnetism in the copper-poor region fades away on moving into the copper-rich region. A superconductivity similar to the one recently discovered under pressure in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point [5] (QCP) might be realized at the normal pressure in the present compound CeCu_{2}Si_{2}. Based on these observations we herein argue that a spin-fluctuation-mediated d-wave state may be realized in these phases or at least in the high-T_{c} phase, as theoretically predicted near an antiferromagnetic instability. [8]

In this paper, we present detailed experimental results pertinent to these superconducting phases by referring to only a few samples of each group as listed in Table 1. More results on the other polycrystalline samples in the rest of the homogeneity field of CeCu_{2}Si_{2} will be published elsewhere. [13]

Polycrystalline samples prepared by levitation melting were employed in the present study and the details of preparation will be given elsewhere. We merely remark here that the superconducting samples located very close each other in the homogeneity field have almost identical lattice parameters, a = 4.096 \pm 0.003 A and c = 9.911 \pm 0.006 A, [12] being thereby crystallographically undistinguishable within the present experimental precision, as can be seen in Table 1. It should also be noted that the nominal compositions of samples used in this study fall within 0.5 at. % from the stoichiometry and that the boundary of the two groups runs approximately along the 39.6 Si at. % line (see Figs. 1 in Refs. [11] and [12]). The specific heat was measured by a quasi-adiabatic heat pulse method in a ^{3}He cryostat and a dilution refrigerator for the range of 0.15 and 25 K, the magnetic susceptibility between 2 and 400 K in 3 kOe with a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer and the electrical resistivity between 0.03 and 300 K with a dc four terminal method.

We first display in Fig. 1 the thermal variation of the electrical resistivity for several samples of the two groups. Although the absolute values are not very reliable because of residual microcracks inherent in these annealed polycrystalline samples, we notice the following differences in the variation of the \rho(T) for the two groups: (1) The temperature corresponding to the low-temperature local maximum diminishes from about 25 K for the high-T_{c} group (#41, 52, and 57) to somewhat below 20 K for the low-T_{c} group (#50, 54, and 70). (2) This local maximum is a little bit larger for the low-T_{c} group. (3) The high-temperature local maximum around 100 K, which is believed to be due to the crystalline electric field (CEF) splitting is negligible for the low-T_{c} group. These facts may implicate some important physical significance somehow related to the Kondo effect in the present system.[10] If the local maximum around 20 K scales with the Kondo temperature T_{\rm k}, T_{\rm k} for the low-T_{c} group must be lower than that for the other.

The typical residual resistivity \rho_{0} for each group was found to be \leq20 \mu\Omega cm for the high-T_{c} samples and \sim100 \mu\Omega cm for the low-T_{c} samples. This trend is consistent with the reported one.[10] Although all these samples contained microcracks and the absolute values may not very rigorously be compared,[11] the high-T_{c} samples have a much smaller \rho_{0} than the low-T_{c} samples, in contrary to the reported positive correlation between T_{c} and \rho_{0}.[14] The large \rho_{0} of the low-T_{c} samples may be due to the lower T_{\rm k}, as hinted above. The normal-state resistivity \rho(T) data below about 4 K were fitted with either \rho_{0}+\DeltaT^{2} or \rho_{0}+\alphaT and found that the former is more appropriate for the temperature range of 0.04 and \sim 2 K, though the linear T dependence is found at intermediate temperatures between 0.7 and \sim 2.5 K for the low-T_{c} group and between \sim 1.5 and \sim 3.5 K for the high-T_{c} group. A fractional power between 1 and 2 is thereby found in a very narrow range around 1.5 K, which is often referred to as evidence of the non-Fermi-liquid regime in the literature. We are not sure whether such an argument is very meaningful or not and we simply remark here that the samples we studied are rather Fermi-liquid-like in this sense. More details of this account will be reported elsewhere.[13]

The inverse magnetic susceptibility was fairly well fitted above about 150 K with a Curie-Weiss law. We found the effective moment in the range of 2.58 \pm 0.02 \mu_{\rm B}/Ce ion and the Weiss temperature in the range of 105\pm 12 K. The obtained effective moment well corresponds to the theoretical value for a trivalent Ce ion assuring that the Ce ions in these samples are paramagnetic at high temperatures. The susceptibility exceeds the extrapolated values from the Curie-Weiss law at lower temperatures, the low-T_{c} group slightly more than the high-T_{c} group.

The specific heat of several superconducting samples is plotted as C_{\rm p}/T( = \gamma) versus T in Fig. 2, where the characteristic features of the two groups clearly manifest themselves. We note here that any corrections have not been made for all the C_{\rm p} data presented in this paper. The peaks for the high-T_{c} group are slightly rounded and broader and the jumps at T_{c}, \DeltaC_{\rm p} are smaller, compared with those for the low-T_{c} group. The parameter \DeltaC_{\rm p}/\gammaT_{c} then amounts to 1.35 at T_{c}^{C_{\rm p}}= 0.59 K for #54 and 0.89 at T_{c}^{C_{\rm p}}= 0.67 K for #57 (see Table 1 for the rest). It is very important to remember here that all the C_{\rm p}/T curves for the superconducting phase appear to extrapolate themselves toward 0 K, guaranteeing thereby that these samples of both groups are clean and fully superconducting. It is further noted that the specific heat of both groups follows a quadratic power law T^{2} above about 0.2 K and below about 0.1 K, as shown in the inset. The quadratic T-dependence may indicate line nodes of zeros in

We further note here about Fig. 2 that the normal state revealed by applying 25 kOe exhibits quite a different T-dependent \gamma below about 1 K, as shown for the high-T_{c} (#52 and 57) and low-T_{c} (#50 and 70) groups. As the concentration of copper, x, is increased from about 38 at. % in the field of homogeneity, a peak in C_{p}/T appears around 0.55 K beyond x=39 at. % as reported earlier[11] and it seems to converge to that of the high-T_{c} #57, which is the nearest sample only 0.25 at. % apart from the low-T_{c} #50. This broad peak of \gamma for the former around 0.55 K is much reminiscent of a magnetic short-range order, but whatever magnetic state it could be, the present superconducting C_{p}/T curves for #52 and #57 vanishing towards 0 K assert that the strongly T-dependent normal state entirely condenses into a superconducting state. On the other hand, the present result suggests that the weakly T-dependent normal state \gamma of the low-T_{c} group may not be due to the loss of coherence, as previously assumed for a similar T dependence in diluted systems.[16] It could not, however, satisfactorily be fitted either with the paramagnon model[17] or the impurity Kondo model with T_{k}\sim 7 K (Ref. [18]) or the spin fluctuation model for the QCP limit of Moriya and Takimoto,[19] although each of these models in some degree simulates the experimental C_{p}/T curve.

It would not be unreasonable at all to expect that the superconducting states developed from these two dissimilar normal states may utterly differ in nature despite the minute difference in composition and T_{c}, and might even belong to a different pairing symmetry.[20] We have seen the clearly different specific heat anomaly at T_{c} in Fig. 2. Further evidence of the fact that these two superconducting phases really differ in nature has recently been obtained from a high-pressure experiment in which an opposite sign of dT_{c}/dp has been found, as displayed in Fig. 3.[21] We merely note here that the pressure dependence of the high-T_{c}, #38 sample seems to be consistent with that reported before.[14]

It is interesting to note that a Monte Carlo simulation on the Hubbard model has revealed that an effective nearest neighbor attraction in the limit of large on-site electron-electron repulsion leads to enhancement of singlet d-wave pairing correlations.[8] By taking account of the fact that the high-T_{c} superconductivity of the present system emerges near the antiferromagnetic instability, we argue that such an even-parity pairing may be realized in the high-T_{c} group. It also seems to be consistent with the quadratic T dependence of the specific heat of the superconducting state, if the spin-orbit effect is important, as noted above (see the inset of Fig. 2).[15]

In Fig. 4 the magnetic-field dependence of \rho(T) is shown for #52 of the high-T_{c} group and #54 of low-T_{c} group, from which upper critical field curves, H_{c2}(T) were deduced by defining the mid-point as a superconducting transition in each field. It is evident that the resistive behaviors in magnetic fields at low temperatures below about T_{c}/3 are quite contrasting for the two groups, as already noted before.[11] This difference may suggest that superconducting parts in the sample retreat quite differently in external magnetic fields with T. The increasing resistance with decreasing T in #54

Figure 2: C_{p}/T vs T in H= 0 and 25 kOe for several samples of two superconducting groups. The inset displays C_{p} vs T in a log-log plot for high-T_{c} (#38, 52, and 57) and low-T_{c} (#50 and 54) groups.

  indicates rapidly subsiding superconducting parts with decreasing T, implying a re-entrant behavior.[22] On the other hand, the destruction of superconductivity rapidly proceeds with the field but not with T for #52. Accordingly we found a very similar H_{c2}(T) curve for #52 and #54, except for the re-entrant curve exhibited by #54.[12] It is very important to further investigate whether this different behavior in external magnetic fields may reflect the difference in the pairing symmetry or not. In fact, structures of vortex lattice in superconductors with an unconventional symmetry have intensively been studied by theorists.[15]

It is finally remarked that no evidence of multiple phase transitions was found in any properties in the external magnetic field investigated in the present study. We thereby think the possibility of multicomponent order parameter for the case of CeCu_{x}Si_{2} unlikely, contrasting with the case of UPt_{3} or U_{1-x}Th_{x}Be_{13}.[15]

In summary we have confirmed that the fundamentally antiferromagnetic non-superconducting state evolves into the high-T_{c} and then another low-T_{c} superconducting state with the increasing copper concentration in the homogeneity field of CeCu_{2}Si_{2}. This general trend is consistent with the one previously reported by Steglich's group.[10] In the present study we have further characterized two superconducting phases with slightly different T_{c}'s situated side by side (only at most 0.25 at. % apart) in the homogeneity field. They exhibit quite different normal states and opposite signs of the pressure dependence dT_{c}/dp, although the specific heat in the superconducting state follows a quadratic T dependence rather than a cubic one for both phases. We speculate from these facts whether the two superconducting states belong to different pairing symmetries of even parities, and probably belong to the high-T_{c} phase as d-wave states which appear near the region of an antiferromagnetic instability. It is a little puzzling that the low-T_{c} phase, possessing a much larger \rho_{0} , exhibits a sharper and larger anomaly of C_{\rho} , i.e. a more ideal bulk superconducting transition at T_{c} than the high-T_{c} phase. Disorder apparently benefits the superconductivity rather than degrades it. It is also the low-T_{c} phase that exhibits a re-entrant behavior in external magnetic fields. These facts may suggest the possibility of an interesting superconductivity in this phase. In any case, it is very amazing that such two different superconducting states emerge in a supposedly uniform and crystallographically undistinguishable homogeneity field. We merely propose here that a magnetic interaction, whatever it could be, may play a decisive role in determining the pairing mechanism or symmetry. It may result, for instance, from a change of the Fermi surface and/or the CEF effect with the copper concentration, which are known by now to strongly influence the f-electron states.[15] In fact, we have already remarked in the discussion of the \rho(T) curves some features indicating a noticeable difference in the Kondo effect and the CEF effect for the two superconducting phases.[20] The present case would without doubt provide us with a good opportunity for our better understanding of the superconductivity in heavy f-electron systems.

We report that the two distinct superconducting phases of CeCu_{2}Si_{2} with a slightly different T_{c} revealed an opposite pressure dependence of T_{c} and quite a different normal state at low temperatures; a strongly T-dependent C_{p}/T peaking around 0.6 K for the high-T_{c} phase as contrasted with a very weak T dependence for the other. The superconducting C_{p}, however, exhibited a quadratic T dependence above 0.2 K and below \sim 0.1 K in both phases. We herein speculate that these two superconducting states might be due to a different pairing mechanism or symmetry.

Ever since the discovery of the first heavy-electron superconductor CeCu_{2}Si_{2}, [1] various types of superconducting f-electron systems like UPt_{3}, UBe_{13}, [2] UPd_{2}Al_{3}, [3] and CeCoIn_{5} (Ref.

More results on the other polycrystalline samples in the rest of the homogeneity field of CeCu_{2}Si_{2} will be published elsewhere. [13]

We merely remark here that the superconducting samples located very close each other in the homogeneity field have almost identical lattice parameters, a = 4.096 \pm 0.003 A and c = 9.911 \pm 0.006 A, [12] being thereby crystallographically undistinguishable within the present experimental precision, as can be seen in Table 1. It should also be noted that the nominal compositions of samples used in this study fall within 0.5 at. % from the stoichiometry and that the boundary of the two groups runs approximately along the 39.6 Si at. % line (see Figs. 1 in Refs. [11] and [12]). The specific heat was measured by a quasi-adiabatic heat pulse method in a ^{3}He cryostat and a dilution refrigerator for the range of 0.15 and 25 K, the magnetic susceptibility between 2 and 400 K in 3 kOe with a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer and the electrical resistivity between 0.03 and 300 K with a dc four terminal method.

We first display in Fig. 1 the thermal variation of the electrical resistivity for several samples of the two groups. Although the absolute values are not very reliable because of residual microcracks inherent in these annealed polycrystalline samples, we notice the following differences in the variation of the \rho(T) for the two groups: (1) The temperature corresponding to the low-temperature local maximum diminishes from about 25 K for the high-T_{c} group (#41, 52, and 57) to somewhat below 20 K for the low-T_{c} group (#50, 54, and 70). (2) This local maximum is a little bit larger for the low-T_{c} group. (3) The high-temperature local maximum around 100 K, which is believed to be due to the crystalline electric field (CEF) splitting is negligible for the low-T_{c} group. These facts may implicate some important physical significance somehow related to the Kondo effect in the present system.[10] If the local maximum around 20 K scales with the Kondo temperature T_{\rm k}, T_{\rm k} for the low-T_{c} group must be lower than that for the other.

The typical residual resistivity \rho_{0} for each group was found to be \leq20 \mu\Omega cm for the high-T_{c} samples and \sim100 \mu\Omega cm for the low-T_{c} samples. This trend is consistent with the reported one.[10] Although all these samples contained microcracks and the absolute values may not very rigorously be compared,[11] the high-T_{c} samples have a much smaller \rho_{0} than the low-T_{c} samples, in contrary to the reported positive correlation between T_{c} and \rho_{0}.[14] The large \rho_{0} of the low-T_{c} samples may be due to the lower T_{\rm k}, as hinted above. The normal-state resistivity \rho(T) data below about 4 K were fitted with either \rho_{0}+\DeltaT^{2} or \rho_{0}+\alphaT and found that the former is more appropriate for the temperature range of 0.04 and \sim 2 K, though the linear T dependence is found at intermediate temperatures between 0.7 and \sim 2.5 K for the low-T_{c} group and between \sim 1.5 and \sim 3.5 K for the high-T_{c} group. A fractional power between 1 and 2 is thereby found in a very narrow range around 1.5 K, which is often referred to as evidence of the non-Fermi-liquid regime in the literature. We are not sure whether such an argument is very meaningful or not and we simply remark here that the samples we studied are rather Fermi-liquid-like in this sense. More details of this account will be reported elsewhere.[13]

The inverse magnetic susceptibility was fairly well fitted above about 150 K with a Curie-Weiss law. We found the effective moment in the range of 2.58 \pm 0.02 \mu_{\rm B}/Ce ion and the Weiss temperature in the range of 105\pm 12 K. The obtained effective moment well corresponds to the theoretical value for a trivalent Ce ion assuring that the Ce ions in these samples are paramagnetic at high temperatures. The susceptibility exceeds the extrapolated values from the Curie-Weiss law at lower temperatures, the low-T_{c} group slightly more than the high-T_{c} group.

The specific heat of several superconducting samples is plotted as C_{\rm p}/T( = \gamma) versus T in Fig. 2, where the characteristic features of the two groups clearly manifest themselves. We note here that any corrections have not been made for all the C_{\rm p} data presented in this paper. The peaks for the high-T_{c} group are slightly rounded and broader and the jumps at T_{c}, \DeltaC_{\rm p} are smaller, compared with those for the low-T_{c} group. The parameter \DeltaC_{\rm p}/\gammaT_{c} then amounts to 1.35 at T_{c}^{C_{\rm p}}= 0.59 K for #54 and 0.89 at T_{c}^{C_{\rm p}}= 0.67 K for #57 (see Table 1 for the rest). It is very important to remember here that all the C_{\rm p}/T curves for the superconducting phase appear to extrapolate themselves toward 0 K, guaranteeing thereby that these samples of both groups are clean and fully superconducting. It is further noted that the specific heat of both groups follows a quadratic power law T^{2} above about 0.2 K and below about 0.1 K, as shown in the inset. The quadratic T-dependence may indicate line nodes of zeros in

We further note here about Fig. 2 that the normal state revealed by applying 25 kOe exhibits quite a different T-dependent \gamma below about 1 K, as shown for the high-T_{c} (#52 and 57) and low-T_{c} (#50 and 70) groups. As the concentration of copper, x, is increased from about 38 at. % in the field of homogeneity, a peak in C_{p}/T appears around 0.55 K beyond x=39 at. % as reported earlier[11] and it seems to converge to that of the high-T_{c} #57, which is the nearest sample only 0.25 at. % apart from the low-T_{c} #50. This broad peak of \gamma for the former around 0.55 K is much reminiscent of a magnetic short-range order, but whatever magnetic state it could be, the present superconducting C_{p}/T curves for #52 and #57 vanishing towards 0 K assert that the strongly T-dependent normal state entirely condenses into a superconducting state. On the other hand, the present result suggests that the weakly T-dependent normal state \gamma of the low-T_{c} group may not be due to the loss of coherence, as previously assumed for a similar T dependence in diluted systems.[16] It could not, however, satisfactorily be fitted either with the paramagnon model[17] or the impurity Kondo model with T_{k}\sim 7 K (Ref. [18]) or the spin fluctuation model for the QCP limit of Moriya and Takimoto,[19] although each of these models in some degree simulates the experimental C_{p}/T curve.

It would not be unreasonable at all to expect that the superconducting states developed from these two dissimilar normal states may utterly differ in nature despite the minute difference in composition and T_{c}, and might even belong to a different pairing symmetry.[20] We have seen the clearly different specific heat anomaly at T_{c} in Fig. 2. Further evidence of the fact that these two superconducting phases really differ in nature has recently been obtained from a high-pressure experiment in which an opposite sign of dT_{c}/dp has been found, as displayed in Fig. 3.[21] We merely note here that the pressure dependence of the high-T_{c}, #38 sample seems to be consistent with that reported before.[14]

It is interesting to note that a Monte Carlo simulation on the Hubbard model has revealed that an effective nearest neighbor attraction in the limit of large on-site electron-electron repulsion leads to enhancement of singlet d-wave pairing correlations.[8] By taking account of the fact that the high-T_{c} superconductivity of the present system emerges near the antiferromagnetic instability, we argue that such an even-parity pairing may be realized in the high-T_{c} group. It also seems to be consistent with the quadratic T dependence of the specific heat of the superconducting state, if the spin-orbit effect is important, as noted above (see the inset of Fig. 2).[15]

In Fig. 4 the magnetic-field dependence of \rho(T) is shown for #52 of the high-T_{c} group and #54 of low-T_{c} group, from which upper critical field curves, H_{c2}(T) were deduced by defining the mid-point as a superconducting transition in each field. It is evident that the resistive behaviors in magnetic fields at low temperatures below about T_{c}/3 are quite contrasting for the two groups, as already noted before.[11] This difference may suggest that superconducting parts in the sample retreat quite differently in external magnetic fields with T. The increasing resistance with decreasing T in #54

  indicates rapidly subsiding superconducting parts with decreasing T, implying a re-entrant behavior.[22] On the other hand, the destruction of superconductivity rapidly proceeds with the field but not with T for #52. Accordingly we found a very similar H_{c2}(T) curve for #52 and #54, except for the re-entrant curve exhibited by #54.[12] It is very important to further investigate whether this different behavior in external magnetic fields may reflect the difference in the pairing symmetry or not. In fact, structures of vortex lattice in superconductors with an unconventional symmetry have intensively been studied by theorists.[15]

It is finally remarked that no evidence of multiple phase transitions was found in any properties in the external magnetic field investigated in the present study. We thereby think the possibility of multicomponent order parameter for the case of CeCu_{x}Si_{2} unlikely, contrasting with the case of UPt_{3} or U_{1-x}Th_{x}Be_{13}.[15]

In summary we have confirmed that the fundamentally antiferromagnetic non-superconducting state evolves into the high-T_{c} and then another low-T_{c} superconducting state with the increasing copper concentration in the homogeneity field of CeCu_{2}Si_{2}. This general trend is consistent with the one previously reported by Steglich's group.[10] In the present study we have further characterized two superconducting phases with slightly different T_{c}'s situated side by side (only at most 0.25 at. % apart) in the homogeneity field. They exhibit quite different normal states and opposite signs of the pressure dependence dT_{c}/dp, although the specific heat in the superconducting state follows a quadratic T dependence rather than a cubic one for both phases. We speculate from these facts whether the two superconducting states belong to different pairing symmetries of even parities, and probably belong to the high-T_{c} phase as d-wave states which appear near the region of an antiferromagnetic instability. It is a little puzzling that the low-T_{c} phase, possessing a much larger \rho_{0} , exhibits a sharper and larger anomaly of C_{\rho} , i.e. a more ideal bulk superconducting transition at T_{c} than the high-T_{c} phase. Disorder apparently benefits the superconductivity rather than degrades it. It is also the low-T_{c} phase that exhibits a re-entrant behavior in external magnetic fields. These facts may suggest the possibility of an interesting superconductivity in this phase. In any case, it is very amazing that such two different superconducting states emerge in a supposedly uniform and crystallographically undistinguishable homogeneity field. We merely propose here that a magnetic interaction, whatever it could be, may play a decisive role in determining the pairing mechanism or symmetry. It may result, for instance, from a change of the Fermi surface and/or the CEF effect with the copper concentration, which are known by now to strongly influence the f-electron states.[15] In fact, we have already remarked in the discussion of the \rho(T) curves some features indicating a noticeable difference in the Kondo effect and the CEF effect for the two superconducting phases.[20] The present case would without doubt provide us with a good opportunity for our better understanding of the superconductivity in heavy f-electron systems.
