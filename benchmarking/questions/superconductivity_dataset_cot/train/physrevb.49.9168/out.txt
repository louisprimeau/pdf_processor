W. M. Tiernan

# Abstract

We report temperature-dependent _kh_sc measurements performed near the superconducting transition on three polycrystalline sintered YBa2Cu3O7-8 samples for selected fixed magnetic fields 0.1 <= H\leq 80.9 G and ac excitation magnetic fields 0.9 <= H_{\rm ac}\leq 450 mG. The nature of _kh_sc was found to depend strongly on the magnitude of _H_sc and for small _H_sc we observe the breakdown of critical-state behavior. We estimate the threshold field for the critical state and interpret our results in the context of Josephson-array granular superconductivity.

## I Introduction

Sintered samples of YBa2Cu3O7-8 (YBCO) consist of a matrix of small superconducting grains, and as a result exhibit two separate ac susceptibility (_kh_sc) responses, one associated with intragranular superconducting currents and another associated with intergranular Josephson currents.[1, 2] There have been many studies of intergranular _kh_sc in sintered YBCO, and experimental _kh_sc results are typically interpreted in the context of type-II superconductivity critical-state models.[3, 4, 5, 6] A recent review article[7] discusses the current understanding of _kh_sc and its relationship to _J_c in both polycrystalline and single-crystal YBCO. Most _kh_sc measurements on sintered YBCO are done with ac excitation fields _H_sc > 100 milli-Gauss (mG). For smaller values of _H_sc, superconducting critical-state models may not be applicable.[7, 8] The regime of very small _H_sc has not been investigated in sintered YBCO and the nature of intergranular _kh_sc in this regime is not well understood. In this work we describe an extensive set of _kh_sc measurements done on three YBCO sintered samples that investigate the evolution of _kh_sc for small to moderate _H_sc. These measurements were done for selected fixed magnetic field 0.1 <= H\leq 80.9 G, ac excitation fields 0.9 <= H_{\rm ac}\leq 450 mG, and temperatures 80 <= T\leq 93 K.

## II Background

The combination of grain boundary Josephson weak links and relatively large grain sizes that occur in sintered YBCO results in a material that provides an experimental realization of a Josephson-array granular superconductor.[9, 10] The starting point for any Josephson-array model is the Josephson equations.[11, 12] For a network of Josephson coupled grains, the Josephson current between grains i and j is I_{ij} = I_{ij}^{0}\sin(\theta_{i} - \theta_{j} - A_{ij}). Here I_{ij}^{0} is the Josephson critical current between grains i and j, \theta_{i} is the superconducting phase of grain i, and A_{j} depends on the vector potential **A** as

\[A_{ij} = (2\pi/\Phi_{0})\int_{i}^{J}{\bf A} \cdot d\tau\]

with \Phi_{0} = hc/2e, the quantum of flux. Summing _A__ij_/2p around a closed loop of grains gives the enclosed magnetic flux in units of the flux quantum \Phi_{0}. The Josephson coupling energy between two grains is

\[E_{ij}^{J} = - (\hbar/2e)I_{ij}^{0}\cos(\theta_{i} - \theta_{j} - A_{ij})\ .\]

For a sintered YBCO sample, an experimentally measured critical-current density _J_c is related to the average Josephson critical current (I_{ij}^{0}), although a direct relationship is complicated by effects of thermal fluctuations and frustration. An applied magnetic field H produces A_{j} terms and may reduce the I_{ij}^{0}. The reduction in I_{ij}^{0} depends on the magnetic flux threading a single junction,[12] whereas the magnitude of A_{j} terms depends on the magnetic flux enclosed by a closed loop of grains. For the measurements described here, we impose a fixed H and investigate the superconducting response as a function of the amplitude of the _ac_ excitation field _H_sc. _H_sc is fairly small for all of our measurements, _H_sc < 0.5 G, and for these values _H_sc causes negligible reduction in the I_{ij}^{0}. Thus, the response to _H_sc for our measurements can be attributed solely to changes in the A_{j}.

The A_{j} terms depend on the applied magnetic field, the sample morphology, and effects of shielding currents. The average grain size, the grain size distribution, and the percentage of the sample actually occupied by superconducting material all affect the relationship of the A_{j} to the applied magnetic field H. The sample morphology sets a characteristic length scale _lg_, which for reasonably dense samples should be comparable to the average grain size, _lg_ ~ (d_{g}). From Eq. (1), (A_{j}) = (p/2)I_{g}^{2}H/\Phi_{0} and _lg_ sets a magnetic field for frustration effects.[10] Frustration effects become important when (A_{j}) ~ _p/2, so the characteristic frustration or "gauge glass" field is H_{g} \sim \Phi_{0}/l_{g}^{2}.

Screening currents complicate the relationship between H and (A_{j}). There are two sources of screening; the partial Meissner effect from intragranular currents and bulk screening due to intergranular Josephson currents. Our samples were field cooled, and the extent of partial Meissner screening in individual grains depends on both the extent of flux pinning[13] and on the ratio of penetra tion depth to grain size _l_/(d_{g}).2,7 The volume of intragranular flux excluded can be estimated experimentally from _kh_' at large H_{c}.7 Two of our samples have (d_{g})~6 _m_m, and for these flux exclusion is about 30-40 % of the sample volume. One of the samples (1333) has (d_{g})~12 _m_m, and the flux exclusion is about 60%. The importance of intergranular Josephson screening depends on the ratio of the Josephson penetration depth l_{J} to both sample radius R and to the grain size. Most of our results are for the temperature region between _T_c0 and T = 80 K. Here l_{J} varies considerably, from l_{J} >>_R_ just below _T_c0 to _l__J_~(d_{g}) for T = 80 K. Thus, intergranular shielding should be negligible just below _T_c0 but gain increasing importance with decreasing temperature.

Critical-state models may be applied to understanding intergranular currents in sintered YBCO if the measured response results from intergranular flux vortices moving over length scales larger than the grain size. Barriers to flux motion result in a gradient in the intergranular flux density, _dB/dr_, which, in turn, results in a critical-current density J_{c}. The critical-state model can be related to the Josephson array model as follows: If _H_ac is large enough to produce changes (_d__A__ij_)~_p_/2, the system of Josephson coupled grains responds with collective rearrangements of the phases _th__i_ in order to minimize the system energy [see Eq. (2)]. This phase rearrangement is isomorphic to the motion of intergranular flux vortices across the sample, and potential wells and barriers encountered by moving intergranular flux vortices correspond to minima and maxima of system energy for particular configurations of _th__i_.14 The applicability of critical-state models to Josephson-array systems requires that _H_ac be greater than some threshold field H_{c}. H_{c} can be estimated in the context of the Josephson array model as _H_ac which results in (A_{j})~_p_/2. Notice that this condition is similar to that defining H_{g}, so that

\[H_{\text{ac}}^{\prime} \sim \Phi_{0}/l_{\text{g}}^{2}\]

## III Apparatus and techniques

A closed-cycle refrigeration system15 was used for the _kh_ac(_T_) and _r_(_T_) measurements described in this work and is described in Refs. 16 and 17. The sample block assembly was attached via a 13 mm x 229 mm Cu connecting rod to the low-temperature stage of the closed-cycle refrigerator and temperature regulation was accomplished by a heater-temperature controller system. The cooling rate for temperature-dependent measurements was typically 0.3 mK/sec. Thermal contact between the sample and the sample block was made primarily at the current contacts and was quite good. For cooling rates _dT/dt_ <= 1 mK/sec we were unable to observe a difference between _r_(_T_) for cooling as opposed to warming runs.

_kh_ac measurements were performed by measuring changes in the mutual inductance between two solenoidal coils formed directly on the sample. These coils were fabricated on three ~2mm x 2mm x 12.5mm sintered samples which were shaped to have a central region of approximately circular cross section for a length of ~8mm. Since the samples are cylindrically shaped in the coil region and are considerably longer than the coils, they have negligible demagnetization factors. Figure 1(b) shows a sectional view along the length of a typical sample. Table 1 lists the mutual inductance L12 for the three samples described here. _kh_ac is related to the emf E induced on the inner or secondary coil by the ac magnetic field _H_ac produced by a sinusoidal current in the outer or primary coil, (_E_)~(_a/c_)(1+4_p_kh_ac). The in-phase E_{X} and quadrature E_{Y} components were measured with a two-phase lock-in amplifier and are related to the real (_kh_') and imaginary (_kh_') and _kh_' = (1/4_p_)(1-_E__X_/_G_0) and _kh_' = (1/4_p_)_G__Y_/_G_0. Here G0 is the induced emf above the superconducting transition. Figure 1(a) shows a schematic of the circuit used to perform _kh_ac measurements. In these measurements the sinusoidal excitation field _H_ac was superimposed on a fixed magnetic field H, with both H and _H_ac applied parallel to the sample axis. Samples were field cooled, and _kh_(_T_) data were taken during cooling. H was produced by a 12-in. electromagnet and magnetic field was measured using a Hall effect gaussmeter. The vertical component of H between the pole pieces was less than 0.1 G.

The _kh_ac measurements described here were done using a frequency f = 980 Hz for _H_ac. This frequency was chosen largely in order to provide an optimum signal at small _H_ac. We also investigated the dependence of _kh_ac on frequency for one of the samples (331) and found that _kh_'' is not significantly affected by changes in the frequency of _H_ac in the range 17 <= f <= 3140 Hz.19

## IV Materials synthesis and characterization

The three polycrystalline sintered samples described in this study were fabricated from YBCO powder made using the polymer-metal-complex precursor fabrication technique.[18]-[20] The powder was pressed into pellets, shaped, and then sintered at 940 degC. Table 1 summarizes several physical properties of the samples. The common features of 85% sample density, room-temperature resistivity r  1 mO cm, and superconducting transition widths _S_T_  1 K (Refs. 16 and 17) are all consistent with good quality sintered samples. The grain size distribution of the samples were analyzed from SEM images. A more complete description of sample synthesis and characterization is given in Refs. 16 and 17.

## V Experimental results and discussion

### General features of _X_ac

We first give a qualitative description of changes in _kh_' and _kh_' as _H_ac changes from very small values for which the critical-state picture is not applicable to larger values typically described by critical-state models. Figure 2 shows plots of _kh_' [Figs. 2(b), 2(d), and 2(f)] and _kh_' [Figs. 2(a), 2(c), and 2(e)] for selected values of _H_ac at fixed H = 0.5 G for samples 331, 1765, and 1333, respectively. Figure 3 shows _kh_' [Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)] and _kh_' [Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)] for sample 331 at selected values of _H_ac at fixed H = 8.1 and 80.9 G, respectively. It is obvious from these figures that _X_ac changes form as the magnitude of _H_ac varies.

_kh_' is a measure of the shielding of _H_ac by sample currents; for _kh_'  0 _H_ac penetrates the sample freely, for _kh_'  - 1/4p. _H_ac is completely screened at the surface of the sample. In all cases _kh_' has the general form of a step function, decreasing from zero below _T_c0, falling relatively steeply, then leveling off at _kh_'  - 1/4p. In all of the samples there is a region just below _T_c0 for which _kh_' is independent of _H_ac and falls roughly linearly with decreasing temperature. In this region _kh_'  0. This is the region of very weak Josephson coupling where _kh_' is due solely to intragranular superconducting screening currents.

Lower temperatures produce stronger Josephson coupling, resulting in significant intergranular Josephson currents. Here _kh_' is nonzero and the general form of both _kh_' and _kh_' exhibits a complex dependence on the magnitude of _H_ac. _kh_' arises from currents that are out of phase with _H_ac and is directly proportional to the energy dissipated per unit volume per cycle of _H_ac.[21] For the values of H and _H_ac used to obtain Figs. 2 and 3, _kh_' arises virtually exclusively from intergranular Josephson currents. For all of the _kh_' data shown in Figs. 2 and 3, as temperature decreases _kh_' rises from zero to a maximum value and then falls again to zero, although the specific structure of this rise and fall depends on the magnitude of _H_ac. For small _H_ac (59 mG) the _kh_' curves have distinctive and sample-dependent structure; for sample 331 _kh_' has two distinct peaks, sample 1333 has a "shoulder" structure, and sample 1765 has a single peak. At larger _H_ac (59 mG) sample-dependent structure disappears and all samples have a similar _kh_' structure, with a single peak and extended low-temperature "tail" as _kh_' goes to zero. At large _H_ac the width of the _kh_' peak broadens and the peak position shifts to lower tempera

 ture with increasing H_{\rm ac}. The large H_{\rm ac} behavior is similar to other experimental results that have successfully been analyzed using critical-state models.[7]

The extent and nature of superconducting screening can be inferred from \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime}. The fraction of intragranular screening can be estimated from the limit of \chi^{\prime} for large H_{\rm ac}. Thus, intergranular Josephson current screening can be determined at a given temperature from the difference between the value of \chi^{\prime} at the large H_{\rm ac} limit and \chi^{\prime} for a given H_{\rm ac}. For the smallest H_{\rm ac}, intergranular currents cause rather abrupt changes in \chi with decreasing temperature; at a sample-dependent temperature \chi^{\prime} drops steeply and \chi^{\prime\prime} increases steeply from 0. For small H_{\rm ac} and T\,\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 3.5pt\hbox{$\mathchar 0\sim$}}\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$ \mathchar 0\sim$}\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$\mathchar 0\sim$}\raise 1.

  peak of \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) to lower temperature, broadens the \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) peak, and produces an extended low-temperature "tail" that gradually approaches zero with decreasing temperature. This behavior is similar to that reported in other studies on sintered YBCO and explained in the context of critical-state models and the temperature dependence of J_{\rm c}. [7]

The behavior at small H_{\rm ac} is not consistent with critical-state models, suggesting that H_{\rm ac}\!<\!H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger}. Moderate H_{\rm ac}, for 9\!\leq\!H_{\rm ac}\!\leq\!90 mG, is apparently a transition region between the two forms discussed above. Here, \chi^{\prime\prime} changes form; the peak value increases, the width broadens, and any structure apparent at lower H_{\rm ac} gradually disappears with increasing H_{\rm ac}. For the three samples we have estimated H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger} as the field for which small H_{\rm ac} structure has disappeared and the peak value has shifted significantly. Using these criteria, we estimate H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger}\!\approx\!90 mG for samples 331 and 1765, and H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger}\!\approx\!45 mG for sample 1333. From Eq. (3), L_{\rm g} can be estimated from H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger} as l_{\rm g}\!=\!\sqrt{\Phi_{0}/H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger}}. For samples 331 and 1765 this gives l_{\rm g}\!\approx\!15\mum, which is over twice the average grain size of \langle\,d_{\rm g}\,\rangle\!\approx\!6\mum. For sample 1333, l_{\rm g}\!\approx\!21\mum, whereas \langle\,d_{\rm g}\,\rangle\!\approx\!12\mum. Thus, for all three samples l_{\rm g}\!\sim\!2\langle\,d_{\rm g}\,\rangle.

For sample 331, changes in \chi_{\rm ac} as a function of changing the fixed magnetic field H in the range 0.1\!\leq\!H\!\leq\!80.9 G were also investigated. Comparison of Figs. 2(a), 3(a), and 3(c) shows that the double-peak structure of \chi_{\rm ac} occurring at small H_{\rm ac} diminishes with increasing H and is not observable at H\!=\!80.9 G. Figures 8 and 9 show the evolution \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) with increasing H for fixed H_{\rm ac}\!=\!1.8 and 90 mG, respectively.

Other than for slight shifts in temperature, the structure of \chi^{\prime\prime} is not significantly affected by increasing H for 0.1\!\leq\!H\!\leq\!2.0 G. For 8\!\leq\!H\!\leq\!80, the peak value of \chi^{\prime\prime} at small H_{\rm ac} appears to increase slightly. Based on these figures, the structure and H_{\rm ac} dependence of \chi^{\prime\prime} is almost identical for H\!\lesssim\!2 G, and shows increasing changes for 8.1\!\leq\!H\!\leq\!80.9 G. The shifts in position with increasing field can be partially attributed to the drop in T_{c} with increasing H. The evolving structure with increasing H also reflects the relatively strong H-dependent decrease in Josephson coupling for H\!>\!5 G.

### Comparison with I-V measurements

We next compare our \chi^{\prime\prime} measurements with results from I-V isotherm measurements performed on samples

Figure 7: \chi^{\prime\prime} vs T for sample 1333 at 

 331 and 1765 that are described in Refs. 16 and 17. For both of these samples we observed an evolution of nonlinear _I-V_ characteristics consistent with recent predictions of _I-V_ scaling near a superconducting transition. These measurements allowed a determination of a bulk superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. For sample 331, T_{c}\!=\!90.83 K and for sample 1765, T_{c}\!=\!90.50 K.

Above T_{c} both samples have ohmic _I-V_ characteristics at low current densities, and in Ref. 16 we describe measurements of the sample resistivity \rho_{L} above T_{c}. \rho_{L}\!\to\!0 as T\!\to\!T_{c}, and the initial increase in \chi^{\prime\prime} occurs near \rho_{L}\!\to\!0. Thus, for T\!>\!T_{c} and small H_{\rm sc}, \chi^{\prime\prime} should be consistent with a normal metal skin depth effect. For small screening currents, so that 4\pi\chi^{\prime\prime}\!<\!<\!1 and \chi^{\prime}\!\approx\!0, a normal metal skin depth approximation gives[21]

\[4\pi\chi^{\prime\prime}\!\approx\!\mu_{0}\omega R^{\,2}/8\rho\ .\] (4)

Here \rho is the sample resistivity and R is the sample radius. Figures 10 and 11 show a comparison of \chi^{\prime\prime} measured directly with that calculated using Eq. (4) and \rho_{L}

  measurements from Refs. 16 and 17. Figure 10 shows results for samples 331, 1765 at H = 0.5 G and Fig. 11 shows data for sample 331 at H = 8.1 and 80.9 G. The skin depth approximation agrees with directly measured \chi^{\prime\prime} in both samples. Differences between calculated and measured \chi^{\prime\prime} may result from sample inhomogeneity. For inhomogeneous materials, transport measurements may underestimate the "average" resistivity of the sample as determined by a \chi^{\prime\prime} measurement, since \chi^{\prime\prime} is less likely to be dominated by small regions of the sample.

Close to but above T_{c}, the _I-V_ characteristics are nonlinear except for very small current densities and the model of a normal metal skin depth effect is no longer appropriate. For T \approx T_{c}, we observed V \propto I^{\alpha} with a \approx 2 for more than three decades in voltage. Below T_{c}I-V characteristics are consistent with a well-defined critical current, and J_{c} was determined for selected temperatures. It is also possible to extract J_{c} data from \chi^{\prime\prime} data using critical-state models.7 Since all of our measurements were done for relatively small excitation fields, H_{\rm ac} < 0.5 G, J_{c} should be virtually independent of H_{\rm ac} and the conditions for the Bean critical-state model should be well met.7,22 The Bean model predicts that 4\pi\chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} = 0.21, where \chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} is the maximum value of \chi^{\prime\prime}. For samples 331 and 1765, the magnitude of 4\pi\chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} \approx 0.15 and 0.20, respectively, are in reasonable agreement with the Bean model prediction. Lower values are consistent with expectations for granular superconductors and result from intragranular flux expulsion.7

\[J_{c}(T_{p}) = H_{\rm ac}/R\ \ .\]

We next compare J_{c} as determined using Eq. (5) with J_{c} obtained directly from _I-V_ measurements. Figure 12(a) shows plots of J_{c} as determined from \chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} and directly taken from the _I-V_ data for samples 331 and 1765 at H = 0.5 G. Figure 12(b) shows J_{c} as determined from \chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} and directly taken from the _I-V_ data for sample 331 at H = 0.5, 8.1, and 80.9 G. Two sets of J_{c} from _I-V_ data are shown in Fig. 12(a), one determined using a 0.1-\muV/cm and the other form a 10-nV/cm electric-field criterion. The agreement between Bean model predictions and _I-V_ measurements is good.

## VI Conclusion

We have performed extensive \chi_{\rm ac}(T) measurements for selected magnetic fields 0.5 \leq H \leq 80.9, excitation fields 1 \leq H_{\rm ac} \leq 450 mG, and 80 \leq T \leq 93 K on a set of sintered YBCO samples. At H_{\rm ac} \geq 90 mG, we observe \chi_{\rm ac} behavior that is consistent with critical-state models and similar to numerous other studies. The measurements for H_{\rm ac} \leq 90 mG represent the first extensive \chi_{\rm ac} measurements in this small H_{\rm ac} regime for sintered YBCO. We observe a distinct and qualitatively different \chi^{\prime\prime} behavior for H_{\rm ac} \leq 9 mG, and see a crossover between the two regimes for 9 \leq H_{\rm ac} \leq 90 mG. Based on these observations, we have determined the threshold field for the breakdown of the critical-state model; H^{\prime}_{\rm ac} \sim 90 mG for two samples with \langle d_{g}\rangle \approx 6\mum and H^{\prime}_{\rm ac} \sim 45 mG for the sample with \langle d_{g}\rangle \approx 12\mum. These results are consistent with predictions based on a Josephson-array model and the morphology of our samples.

We have additionally characterized the behavior of \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) in this small H_{\rm ac} regime, both for different samples and as a function of magnetic field strength in the range 0.1 \leq H \leq 81 G. We find that for very small H_{\rm ac}, \chi^{\prime\prime} differs from its behavior at large H_{\rm ac} by having significantly smaller peak values and by having a \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) shape that is independent of H_{\rm ac}. The shape at small H_{\rm ac} exhibits a sample-dependent structure that is not observable in the critical-state regime (H_{\rm ac} \geq 90 mG).

We report temperature-dependent _kh_sc measurements performed near the superconducting transition on three polycrystalline sintered YBa2Cu3O7-8 samples for selected fixed magnetic fields 0.1 <= H\leq 80.9 G and ac excitation magnetic fields 0.9 <= H_{\rm ac}\leq 450 mG. The nature of _kh_sc was found to depend strongly on the magnitude of _H_sc and for small _H_sc we observe the breakdown of critical-state behavior. We estimate the threshold field for the critical state and interpret our results in the context of Josephson-array granular superconductivity.

## I Introduction

Sintered samples of YBa2Cu3O7-8 (YBCO) consist of a matrix of small superconducting grains, and as a result exhibit two separate ac susceptibility (_kh_sc) responses, one associated with intragranular superconducting currents and another associated with intergranular Josephson currents.[1, 2] There have been many studies of intergranular _kh_sc in sintered YBCO, and experimental _kh_sc results are typically interpreted in the context of type-II superconductivity critical-state models.[3, 4, 5, 6] A recent review article[7] discusses the current understanding of _kh_sc and its relationship to _J_c in both polycrystalline and single-crystal YBCO. Most _kh_sc measurements on sintered YBCO are done with ac excitation fields _H_sc > 100 milli-Gauss (mG). For smaller values of _H_sc, superconducting critical-state models may not be applicable.[7, 8] The regime of very small _H_sc has not been investigated in sintered YBCO and the nature of intergranular _kh_sc in this regime is not well understood. In this work we describe an extensive set of _kh_sc measurements done on three YBCO sintered samples that investigate the evolution of _kh_sc for small to moderate _H_sc. These measurements were done for selected fixed magnetic field 0.1 <= H\leq 80.9 G, ac excitation fields 0.9 <= H_{\rm ac}\leq 450 mG, and temperatures 80 <= T\leq 93 K.

## II Background

The combination of grain boundary Josephson weak links and relatively large grain sizes that occur in sintered YBCO results in a material that provides an experimental realization of a Josephson-array granular superconductor.[9, 10] The starting point for any Josephson-array model is the Josephson equations.[11, 12] For a network of Josephson coupled grains, the Josephson current between grains i and j is I_{ij} = I_{ij}^{0}\sin(\theta_{i} - \theta_{j} - A_{ij}). Here I_{ij}^{0} is the Josephson critical current between grains i and j, \theta_{i} is the superconducting phase of grain i, and A_{j} depends on the vector potential **A** as

\[A_{ij} = (2\pi/\Phi_{0})\int_{i}^{J}{\bf A} \cdot d\tau\]

with \Phi_{0} = hc/2e, the quantum of flux. Summing _A__ij_/2p around a closed loop of grains gives the enclosed magnetic flux in units of the flux quantum \Phi_{0}. The Josephson coupling energy between two grains is

\[E_{ij}^{J} = - (\hbar/2e)I_{ij}^{0}\cos(\theta_{i} - \theta_{j} - A_{ij})\ .\]

For a sintered YBCO sample, an experimentally measured critical-current density _J_c is related to the average Josephson critical current (I_{ij}^{0}), although a direct relationship is complicated by effects of thermal fluctuations and frustration. An applied magnetic field H produces A_{j} terms and may reduce the I_{ij}^{0}. The reduction in I_{ij}^{0} depends on the magnetic flux threading a single junction,[12] whereas the magnitude of A_{j} terms depends on the magnetic flux enclosed by a closed loop of grains. For the measurements described here, we impose a fixed H and investigate the superconducting response as a function of the amplitude of the _ac_ excitation field _H_sc. _H_sc is fairly small for all of our measurements, _H_sc < 0.5 G, and for these values _H_sc causes negligible reduction in the I_{ij}^{0}. Thus, the response to _H_sc for our measurements can be attributed solely to changes in the A_{j}.

The A_{j} terms depend on the applied magnetic field, the sample morphology, and effects of shielding currents. The average grain size, the grain size distribution, and the percentage of the sample actually occupied by superconducting material all affect the relationship of the A_{j} to the applied magnetic field H. The sample morphology sets a characteristic length scale _lg_, which for reasonably dense samples should be comparable to the average grain size, _lg_ ~ (d_{g}). From Eq. (1), (A_{j}) = (p/2)I_{g}^{2}H/\Phi_{0} and _lg_ sets a magnetic field for frustration effects.[10] Frustration effects become important when (A_{j}) ~ _p/2, so the characteristic frustration or "gauge glass" field is H_{g} \sim \Phi_{0}/l_{g}^{2}.

Screening currents complicate the relationship between H and (A_{j}). There are two sources of screening; the partial Meissner effect from intragranular currents and bulk screening due to intergranular Josephson currents. Our samples were field cooled, and the extent of partial Meissner screening in individual grains depends on both the extent of flux pinning[13] and on the ratio of penetra tion depth to grain size _l_/(d_{g}).2,7 The volume of intragranular flux excluded can be estimated experimentally from _kh_' at large H_{c}.7 Two of our samples have (d_{g})~6 _m_m, and for these flux exclusion is about 30-40 % of the sample volume. One of the samples (1333) has (d_{g})~12 _m_m, and the flux exclusion is about 60%. The importance of intergranular Josephson screening depends on the ratio of the Josephson penetration depth l_{J} to both sample radius R and to the grain size. Most of our results are for the temperature region between _T_c0 and T = 80 K. Here l_{J} varies considerably, from l_{J} >>_R_ just below _T_c0 to _l__J_~(d_{g}) for T = 80 K. Thus, intergranular shielding should be negligible just below _T_c0 but gain increasing importance with decreasing temperature.

Critical-state models may be applied to understanding intergranular currents in sintered YBCO if the measured response results from intergranular flux vortices moving over length scales larger than the grain size. Barriers to flux motion result in a gradient in the intergranular flux density, _dB/dr_, which, in turn, results in a critical-current density J_{c}. The critical-state model can be related to the Josephson array model as follows: If _H_ac is large enough to produce changes (_d__A__ij_)~_p_/2, the system of Josephson coupled grains responds with collective rearrangements of the phases _th__i_ in order to minimize the system energy [see Eq. (2)]. This phase rearrangement is isomorphic to the motion of intergranular flux vortices across the sample, and potential wells and barriers encountered by moving intergranular flux vortices correspond to minima and maxima of system energy for particular configurations of _th__i_.14 The applicability of critical-state models to Josephson-array systems requires that _H_ac be greater than some threshold field H_{c}. H_{c} can be estimated in the context of the Josephson array model as _H_ac which results in (A_{j})~_p_/2. Notice that this condition is similar to that defining H_{g}, so that

\[H_{\text{ac}}^{\prime} \sim \Phi_{0}/l_{\text{g}}^{2}\]

## III Apparatus and techniques

A closed-cycle refrigeration system15 was used for the _kh_ac(_T_) and _r_(_T_) measurements described in this work and is described in Refs. 16 and 17. The sample block assembly was attached via a 13 mm x 229 mm Cu connecting rod to the low-temperature stage of the closed-cycle refrigerator and temperature regulation was accomplished by a heater-temperature controller system. The cooling rate for temperature-dependent measurements was typically 0.3 mK/sec. Thermal contact between the sample and the sample block was made primarily at the current contacts and was quite good. For cooling rates _dT/dt_ <= 1 mK/sec we were unable to observe a difference between _r_(_T_) for cooling as opposed to warming runs.

_kh_ac measurements were performed by measuring changes in the mutual inductance between two solenoidal coils formed directly on the sample. These coils were fabricated on three ~2mm x 2mm x 12.5mm sintered samples which were shaped to have a central region of approximately circular cross section for a length of ~8mm. Since the samples are cylindrically shaped in the coil region and are considerably longer than the coils, they have negligible demagnetization factors. Figure 1(b) shows a sectional view along the length of a typical sample. Table 1 lists the mutual inductance L12 for the three samples described here. _kh_ac is related to the emf E induced on the inner or secondary coil by the ac magnetic field _H_ac produced by a sinusoidal current in the outer or primary coil, (_E_)~(_a/c_)(1+4_p_kh_ac). The in-phase E_{X} and quadrature E_{Y} components were measured with a two-phase lock-in amplifier and are related to the real (_kh_') and imaginary (_kh_') and _kh_' = (1/4_p_)(1-_E__X_/_G_0) and _kh_' = (1/4_p_)_G__Y_/_G_0. Here G0 is the induced emf above the superconducting transition. Figure 1(a) shows a schematic of the circuit used to perform _kh_ac measurements. In these measurements the sinusoidal excitation field _H_ac was superimposed on a fixed magnetic field H, with both H and _H_ac applied parallel to the sample axis. Samples were field cooled, and _kh_(_T_) data were taken during cooling. H was produced by a 12-in. electromagnet and magnetic field was measured using a Hall effect gaussmeter. The vertical component of H between the pole pieces was less than 0.1 G.

The _kh_ac measurements described here were done using a frequency f = 980 Hz for _H_ac. This frequency was chosen largely in order to provide an optimum signal at small _H_ac. We also investigated the dependence of _kh_ac on frequency for one of the samples (331) and found that _kh_'' is not significantly affected by changes in the frequency of _H_ac in the range 17 <= f <= 3140 Hz.19

## IV Materials synthesis and characterization

The three polycrystalline sintered samples described in this study were fabricated from YBCO powder made using the polymer-metal-complex precursor fabrication technique.[18]-[20] The powder was pressed into pellets, shaped, and then sintered at 940 degC. Table 1 summarizes several physical properties of the samples. The common features of 85% sample density, room-temperature resistivity r  1 mO cm, and superconducting transition widths _S_T_  1 K (Refs. 16 and 17) are all consistent with good quality sintered samples. The grain size distribution of the samples were analyzed from SEM images. A more complete description of sample synthesis and characterization is given in Refs. 16 and 17.

## V Experimental results and discussion

### General features of _X_ac

We first give a qualitative description of changes in _kh_' and _kh_' as _H_ac changes from very small values for which the critical-state picture is not applicable to larger values typically described by critical-state models. Figure 2 shows plots of _kh_' [Figs. 2(b), 2(d), and 2(f)] and _kh_' [Figs. 2(a), 2(c), and 2(e)] for selected values of _H_ac at fixed H = 0.5 G for samples 331, 1765, and 1333, respectively. Figure 3 shows _kh_' [Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)] and _kh_' [Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)] for sample 331 at selected values of _H_ac at fixed H = 8.1 and 80.9 G, respectively. It is obvious from these figures that _X_ac changes form as the magnitude of _H_ac varies.

_kh_' is a measure of the shielding of _H_ac by sample currents; for _kh_'  0 _H_ac penetrates the sample freely, for _kh_'  - 1/4p. _H_ac is completely screened at the surface of the sample. In all cases _kh_' has the general form of a step function, decreasing from zero below _T_c0, falling relatively steeply, then leveling off at _kh_'  - 1/4p. In all of the samples there is a region just below _T_c0 for which _kh_' is independent of _H_ac and falls roughly linearly with decreasing temperature. In this region _kh_'  0. This is the region of very weak Josephson coupling where _kh_' is due solely to intragranular superconducting screening currents.

Lower temperatures produce stronger Josephson coupling, resulting in significant intergranular Josephson currents. Here _kh_' is nonzero and the general form of both _kh_' and _kh_' exhibits a complex dependence on the magnitude of _H_ac. _kh_' arises from currents that are out of phase with _H_ac and is directly proportional to the energy dissipated per unit volume per cycle of _H_ac.[21] For the values of H and _H_ac used to obtain Figs. 2 and 3, _kh_' arises virtually exclusively from intergranular Josephson currents. For all of the _kh_' data shown in Figs. 2 and 3, as temperature decreases _kh_' rises from zero to a maximum value and then falls again to zero, although the specific structure of this rise and fall depends on the magnitude of _H_ac. For small _H_ac (59 mG) the _kh_' curves have distinctive and sample-dependent structure; for sample 331 _kh_' has two distinct peaks, sample 1333 has a "shoulder" structure, and sample 1765 has a single peak. At larger _H_ac (59 mG) sample-dependent structure disappears and all samples have a similar _kh_' structure, with a single peak and extended low-temperature "tail" as _kh_' goes to zero. At large _H_ac the width of the _kh_' peak broadens and the peak position shifts to lower tempera

 ture with increasing H_{\rm ac}. The large H_{\rm ac} behavior is similar to other experimental results that have successfully been analyzed using critical-state models.[7]

The extent and nature of superconducting screening can be inferred from \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime}. The fraction of intragranular screening can be estimated from the limit of \chi^{\prime} for large H_{\rm ac}. Thus, intergranular Josephson current screening can be determined at a given temperature from the difference between the value of \chi^{\prime} at the large H_{\rm ac} limit and \chi^{\prime} for a given H_{\rm ac}. For the smallest H_{\rm ac}, intergranular currents cause rather abrupt changes in \chi with decreasing temperature; at a sample-dependent temperature \chi^{\prime} drops steeply and \chi^{\prime\prime} increases steeply from 0. For small H_{\rm ac} and T\,\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 3.5pt\hbox{$\mathchar 0\sim$}}\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$ \mathchar 0\sim$}\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$\mathchar 0\sim$}\raise 1.

  peak of \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) to lower temperature, broadens the \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) peak, and produces an extended low-temperature "tail" that gradually approaches zero with decreasing temperature. This behavior is similar to that reported in other studies on sintered YBCO and explained in the context of critical-state models and the temperature dependence of J_{\rm c}. [7]

The behavior at small H_{\rm ac} is not consistent with critical-state models, suggesting that H_{\rm ac}\!<\!H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger}. Moderate H_{\rm ac}, for 9\!\leq\!H_{\rm ac}\!\leq\!90 mG, is apparently a transition region between the two forms discussed above. Here, \chi^{\prime\prime} changes form; the peak value increases, the width broadens, and any structure apparent at lower H_{\rm ac} gradually disappears with increasing H_{\rm ac}. For the three samples we have estimated H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger} as the field for which small H_{\rm ac} structure has disappeared and the peak value has shifted significantly. Using these criteria, we estimate H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger}\!\approx\!90 mG for samples 331 and 1765, and H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger}\!\approx\!45 mG for sample 1333. From Eq. (3), L_{\rm g} can be estimated from H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger} as l_{\rm g}\!=\!\sqrt{\Phi_{0}/H_{\rm ac}^{\dagger}}. For samples 331 and 1765 this gives l_{\rm g}\!\approx\!15\mum, which is over twice the average grain size of \langle\,d_{\rm g}\,\rangle\!\approx\!6\mum. For sample 1333, l_{\rm g}\!\approx\!21\mum, whereas \langle\,d_{\rm g}\,\rangle\!\approx\!12\mum. Thus, for all three samples l_{\rm g}\!\sim\!2\langle\,d_{\rm g}\,\rangle.

For sample 331, changes in \chi_{\rm ac} as a function of changing the fixed magnetic field H in the range 0.1\!\leq\!H\!\leq\!80.9 G were also investigated. Comparison of Figs. 2(a), 3(a), and 3(c) shows that the double-peak structure of \chi_{\rm ac} occurring at small H_{\rm ac} diminishes with increasing H and is not observable at H\!=\!80.9 G. Figures 8 and 9 show the evolution \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) with increasing H for fixed H_{\rm ac}\!=\!1.8 and 90 mG, respectively.

Other than for slight shifts in temperature, the structure of \chi^{\prime\prime} is not significantly affected by increasing H for 0.1\!\leq\!H\!\leq\!2.0 G. For 8\!\leq\!H\!\leq\!80, the peak value of \chi^{\prime\prime} at small H_{\rm ac} appears to increase slightly. Based on these figures, the structure and H_{\rm ac} dependence of \chi^{\prime\prime} is almost identical for H\!\lesssim\!2 G, and shows increasing changes for 8.1\!\leq\!H\!\leq\!80.9 G. The shifts in position with increasing field can be partially attributed to the drop in T_{c} with increasing H. The evolving structure with increasing H also reflects the relatively strong H-dependent decrease in Josephson coupling for H\!>\!5 G.

### Comparison with I-V measurements

We next compare our \chi^{\prime\prime} measurements with results from I-V isotherm measurements performed on samples

Figure 7: \chi^{\prime\prime} vs T for sample 1333 at 

 331 and 1765 that are described in Refs. 16 and 17. For both of these samples we observed an evolution of nonlinear _I-V_ characteristics consistent with recent predictions of _I-V_ scaling near a superconducting transition. These measurements allowed a determination of a bulk superconducting transition temperature T_{c}. For sample 331, T_{c}\!=\!90.83 K and for sample 1765, T_{c}\!=\!90.50 K.

Above T_{c} both samples have ohmic _I-V_ characteristics at low current densities, and in Ref. 16 we describe measurements of the sample resistivity \rho_{L} above T_{c}. \rho_{L}\!\to\!0 as T\!\to\!T_{c}, and the initial increase in \chi^{\prime\prime} occurs near \rho_{L}\!\to\!0. Thus, for T\!>\!T_{c} and small H_{\rm sc}, \chi^{\prime\prime} should be consistent with a normal metal skin depth effect. For small screening currents, so that 4\pi\chi^{\prime\prime}\!<\!<\!1 and \chi^{\prime}\!\approx\!0, a normal metal skin depth approximation gives[21]

\[4\pi\chi^{\prime\prime}\!\approx\!\mu_{0}\omega R^{\,2}/8\rho\ .\] (4)

Here \rho is the sample resistivity and R is the sample radius. Figures 10 and 11 show a comparison of \chi^{\prime\prime} measured directly with that calculated using Eq. (4) and \rho_{L}

  measurements from Refs. 16 and 17. Figure 10 shows results for samples 331, 1765 at H = 0.5 G and Fig. 11 shows data for sample 331 at H = 8.1 and 80.9 G. The skin depth approximation agrees with directly measured \chi^{\prime\prime} in both samples. Differences between calculated and measured \chi^{\prime\prime} may result from sample inhomogeneity. For inhomogeneous materials, transport measurements may underestimate the "average" resistivity of the sample as determined by a \chi^{\prime\prime} measurement, since \chi^{\prime\prime} is less likely to be dominated by small regions of the sample.

Close to but above T_{c}, the _I-V_ characteristics are nonlinear except for very small current densities and the model of a normal metal skin depth effect is no longer appropriate. For T \approx T_{c}, we observed V \propto I^{\alpha} with a \approx 2 for more than three decades in voltage. Below T_{c}I-V characteristics are consistent with a well-defined critical current, and J_{c} was determined for selected temperatures. It is also possible to extract J_{c} data from \chi^{\prime\prime} data using critical-state models.7 Since all of our measurements were done for relatively small excitation fields, H_{\rm ac} < 0.5 G, J_{c} should be virtually independent of H_{\rm ac} and the conditions for the Bean critical-state model should be well met.7,22 The Bean model predicts that 4\pi\chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} = 0.21, where \chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} is the maximum value of \chi^{\prime\prime}. For samples 331 and 1765, the magnitude of 4\pi\chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} \approx 0.15 and 0.20, respectively, are in reasonable agreement with the Bean model prediction. Lower values are consistent with expectations for granular superconductors and result from intragranular flux expulsion.7

We next compare J_{c} as determined using Eq. (5) with J_{c} obtained directly from _I-V_ measurements. Figure 12(a) shows plots of J_{c} as determined from \chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} and directly taken from the _I-V_ data for samples 331 and 1765 at H = 0.5 G. Figure 12(b) shows J_{c} as determined from \chi^{\prime\prime}_{m} and directly taken from the _I-V_ data for sample 331 at H = 0.5, 8.1, and 80.9 G. Two sets of J_{c} from _I-V_ data are shown in Fig. 12(a), one determined using a 0.1-\muV/cm and the other form a 10-nV/cm electric-field criterion. The agreement between Bean model predictions and _I-V_ measurements is good.

## VI Conclusion

We have performed extensive \chi_{\rm ac}(T) measurements for selected magnetic fields 0.5 \leq H \leq 80.9, excitation fields 1 \leq H_{\rm ac} \leq 450 mG, and 80 \leq T \leq 93 K on a set of sintered YBCO samples. At H_{\rm ac} \geq 90 mG, we observe \chi_{\rm ac} behavior that is consistent with critical-state models and similar to numerous other studies. The measurements for H_{\rm ac} \leq 90 mG represent the first extensive \chi_{\rm ac} measurements in this small H_{\rm ac} regime for sintered YBCO. We observe a distinct and qualitatively different \chi^{\prime\prime} behavior for H_{\rm ac} \leq 9 mG, and see a crossover between the two regimes for 9 \leq H_{\rm ac} \leq 90 mG. Based on these observations, we have determined the threshold field for the breakdown of the critical-state model; H^{\prime}_{\rm ac} \sim 90 mG for two samples with \langle d_{g}\rangle \approx 6\mum and H^{\prime}_{\rm ac} \sim 45 mG for the sample with \langle d_{g}\rangle \approx 12\mum. These results are consistent with predictions based on a Josephson-array model and the morphology of our samples.

We have additionally characterized the behavior of \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) in this small H_{\rm ac} regime, both for different samples and as a function of magnetic field strength in the range 0.1 \leq H \leq 81 G. We find that for very small H_{\rm ac}, \chi^{\prime\prime} differs from its behavior at large H_{\rm ac} by having significantly smaller peak values and by having a \chi^{\prime\prime}(T) shape that is independent of H_{\rm ac}. The shape at small H_{\rm ac} exhibits a sample-dependent structure that is not observable in the critical-state regime (H_{\rm ac} \geq 90 mG).
