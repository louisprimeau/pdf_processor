value at 4.2 K, zero resistivity was detected above 5 GPa, where a
pressure-induced superconductivity was confirmed. The onset $T_{\rm c}$
appears at 29 K under 5 GPa and decreases with increasing pressure. As
shown Fig. 1(c), the resistivity loss was also detected by measurements
using the DAC. The superconducting transition was not detected below 4
GPa, but a kink was observed at 29 K under 5 GPa. The resistivity loss
just below the kink becomes larger and the kink shifts to
low-temperature side with increasing pressure. This kink is considered
as the onset of superconducting transition. In this measurement, no zero
resistivity was observed even in the highest pressure, but we confirmed
current effect on the resistivity loss. The failure to observe zero
resistivity is probably caused by a minor resistivity in the contact
between sample and electrodes and/or a nonhydrostatic pressure condition
arising from the use of a solid pressure-transmitting medium.

After the measurement at 20 GPa, external pressure was decreased to 10,
6, and 3 GPa and the resistivity was measured at each pressure [Fig.
1(d)]. The onset $T_{\rm c}$ increases with decreasing pressure, then
the superconducting transition vanishes at 3 GPa. The obtained data in
the pressure-decreasing process are in excellent agreement with those in
the pressure-increasing process shown in Fig. 1(c). Therefore, the
pressure-induced superconducting transition of CaFeAsF is reversible and
no pressure-induced degradation of the sample occurs.

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity for Ca(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))AsF and Ca(Fe_(0.8)Co_(0.2))AsF
under various pressures of up to 2.5 GPa, respectively. As shown in the
insets of Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), the anomaly due to the structural and
magnetic transitions is completely suppressed by Co substitution over
x=0.1 and superconductivity is realized at 0 GPa at the onset
$T_{\rm c}$=23.8 and 16.4 K for x=0.1 and 0.2, respectively. $T_{\rm c}$
increases initially to 24.7 K at 1.0 GPa for x=0.1 and to 16.7 K at 0.4
GPa for x=0.2, but decreases upon increasing applying pressure. We also
observed similar pressure dependence of $T_{\rm c}$ for x=0.15;
$T_{\rm c}$ increases from 20.4 K at 0 GPa to 20.7 K at 0.4 GPa and then
decreases.

The pressure dependence of $T_{\rm 0}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ for
Ca(Fe_(1...)Co_(x))AsF are summarized in Fig. 3. $T_{\rm 0}$ at which
ρ(T) shows anomaly linearly decreases with increasing pressure at a rate
of 12.3 K/GPa and then vanishes at a critical pressure $P_{\rm c}$∼ 5
GPa. The pressure-induced superconductivity emerges with $T_{\rm c}$=29
K after suppression of the anomaly at

data were obtained using piston-cylinder-type cell.

$T_{\rm 0}$. $T_{\rm c}$ shows maximum value at $P_{\rm c}$ and
monotonically decreases upon increasing applying pressure. Similar
pressure effects on $T_{\rm 0}$ and $T_{\rm c}$ have been reported in
SrFe₂As₂ and BaFe₂As₂; the antiferromagnetically ordered orthorhombic
phase is suppressed and superconductivity with maximum $T_{\rm c}$
emerges at $P_{\rm c}$[31, 32]. Pure LaFeAsO has also been found to be
superconductor under high pressure.[20] In case of LaFeAsO, $T_{\rm 0}$
is suppressed by pressure and zero resistivity is detected at 12 GPa,
where the maximum $T_{\rm c}$ is observed. It seems that a critical
pressure in LaFeAsO exists at ∼12 GPa. Here, the onset $T_{\rm c}$ shows
a dome-shaped pressure dependency and the critical pressure is not
observed clearly. The discrepancy between the results of CaFeAaF and
LaFeAsO may be attributed to the inhomogeneity of the sample and/or
external pressure because the transition in LaFeAsO is gradual.

All the Co-doped superconductors show no marked increase of $T_{\rm c}$.
The onset $T_{\rm c}$ increases initially but the enhancement is less
than 1 K, which is quite small compared with that in
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x). The maximum $T_{\rm c}$ ($T_{\rm c,max}$) of each
sample decreases with increasing Co concentration.

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show $T_{\rm c,max}$ obtained under high pressure
and the onset $T_{\rm c}$ at 0 GPa in Ca(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))AsF and
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) as a function of x, respectively. Both systems
exhibit superconductivity at 0 GPa by Co or F substitution. Also, both
parent compounds show pressure-induced superconductivity. In
Ca(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))AsF system, the highest $T_{\rm c}$ is observed for
parent compound. The enhancement of $T_{\rm c}$ by pressure is small for
x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2. As a result, $T_{\rm c,max}$ monotonically
decreases with increasing Co concentration. In contrast,
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) shows marked enhancement of $T_{\rm c}$ in heavily
doped region.[4, 20] In particular, $T_{\rm c}$ of
LaFeAsO_(0.86)F_(0.14) increases from 19 K to $T_{\rm c,max}$=43 K. This
value is equivalent to $T_{\rm c,max}$ of LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11),
although $T_{\rm c}$ at 0 GPa is lower than that of
LaFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) by 9 K. In lightly doped region (x=0.05 and
0.08), $T_{\rm c}$ is increased by pressure but its enhancement of ∼5 K
is small compared with that in heavily doped region. Consequently,
$T_{\rm c,max}$ in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) shows marked enhancement by F
substitution.

It is thought that both the Co substitution in CaFeAsF and the F
substitution in LaFeAsO introduce electrons in FeAs layers. However,
electrons are directly doped into FeAs layers by partial replacement of
Fe with Co, whereas the F substitution is regarded as indirect electron
doping via LaO layers. The Co substitution leads randomness of
superconducting (Fe,Co)As layers.[33] That is, the replacement of Fe
introduces scattering centers in superconducting layers. Indeed, the
resistivity shows upturn in lower temperatures by small amount of Co.
This is one of the reasons for the suppression of $T_{\rm c,max}$ in
Ca(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))AsF. It has been considered that iron-based
superconductor is robust against the replacement of Fe compared with the
replacement of Cu in cuprates because superconductivity is realized by
substituting Co for Fe. Although the antiferromagnetically ordered
orthorhombic phase is suppressed, the results of pressure effect
indicate that Co substitution also suppresses superconductivity.
Therefore, from the viewpoint of pressure effect, it suggests that
direct doping into FeAs layers is not useful for realizing higher
$T_{\rm c}$ in iron-based superconductor. Actually, iron-based
superconductors induced by Co doping show lower $T_{\rm c}$ than those
induced by indirect carrier doping.[26, 27, 28] Also, it has been
reported that the substitution of Ca with

function of (a) Co content for Ca(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))AsF and (b) F content
for LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x). The pressures at which the maximum $T_{\rm c}$
was observed are shown for each compound. The solid and dashed lines are
guides to the eye. The data of LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) were reported in
Refs. [4] and [20].

dashed lines indicate the critical pressures $P_{\rm c}$. The solid

(_R_ =rare earth), which is regard as indirect electron doping, can
cause superconductivity, [34] Note that the maximum _T_c of 29 K of
parent compound CaFeAsF is higher than that of 21 K of LaFeAsO.
Therefore, CaFeAsF can be considered as a candidate parent compound of
iron-based superconductor with higher _T_c. The rare-earth substitution
is known to suffer from oxygen contamination of sample. Hence, we expect
that higher _T_c is realized in CaFeAsF if indirect carrier doping by
substitution for F or F deficiency is successful.

In summary, we performed systematic investigation of pressure effect on
_T_c in Ca(Fe1-xCo3)AsF. The parent compound exhibits pressure-induced
superconductivity with onset _T_c=29 K at 5 GPa, after suppression of
the resistive anomaly due to the structural and magnetic transitions.
Unlike the pressure effect on _T_c in LaFeAsO1-xF, the Co-doped
superconductors show no marked enhancement of _T_c. The maximum _T_c of
each sample monotonically decreases with increasing Co concentration.
This is probably due to randomness of superconducting layers caused by
direct doping into FeAs layers. As a result, the highest _T_c among
Ca(Fe1-xCo3)AsF was obtained in the parent compound. The maximum _T_c of
29 K in parent compound is higher than that in LaFeAsO. Therefore, we
expect that higher _T_c is realized if indirect doping such as
substitution for F or F deficiency is successful in CaFeAsF.
