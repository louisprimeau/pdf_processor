###### Abstract

The specific heat of a high purity twinned crystal of DyBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.00}\) grown in a BaZrO\({}_{3}\) crucible is reported in magnetic field \(B\)1_c_ and _B_\(\perp\)_c_ up to 16 T. First-order-like specific heats are observed on the melting line of vortex matter from \(\approx\)6 to 16 T (_B_\(\parallel\)_c_). The entropy jump is 0.5\(\pm\)0.1 _k\({}_{B}\)_/vortex/layer. The fields _B_m and peak temperatures _T_m obey the relation _B_m[_T_] = 139(1 - _T_m/_T_c_).133. The anisotropy factor for the effective masses is (_m_c/_m_ab_)142 = 5.3 +- 0.5. These characteristics match closely those obtained for nonmagnetic, twinned YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.00}\). [S0163-1829(98)04442-7]

Recent experiments probing both the dynamics and the equilibrium state of vortex matter in the high-temperature superconductors (HTS's) Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (Bi-2212) and YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (Y-123) have shown that the true phase transition in a field \(B\) > 0 does not occur on the mean-field upper critical field line [_H_\({}_{c2}\)(_T_)], as was observed generally for classic type-II superconductors, but on the so-called melting line [_H_\({}_{m}\)(_T_)] where the shear modulus of the vortex solid decreases abruptly. At higher temperatures, vortices remain in a fluid state until they decay in a crossover region about _H_\({}_{c2}\). The electrical resistance vanishes on the melting line, and corresponds to a first- or second-order thermodynamic transition in magnetization and calorimetric experiments, depending on whether the vortex solid is periodic or glassy.1-12 According to Ehrenfest's classification, the order of the transition is determined by the lowest order of differential coefficient of the Gibbs function which shows a discontinuity on the transition line. If the transition at the melting temperature _T_\({}_{m}\)(_B_) is of first order, one should observe a discontinuity D_S_ in the entropy, i.e., a \(d\) peak in the specific heat \(C\) = _T_(_d_S_I_/_dT_). If the transition is of second order, a specific heat jump D_C_ is expected. In real samples, the transition temperature is distributed, so that one expects a more or less Gaussian peak for first order and a rounded step for second order. The distinction is experimentally more subtle for critical transitions.

Up to now, in spite of the anticipated generality of the phenomenon of vortex melting, specific heat anomalies on the melting line could be observed but for one single compound, namely, Y-123.7-12 We present here the calorimetric observation of the melting line for a second compound DyBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (Dy-123).

The single crystal used in this work is of high quality grown in a BaZrO\({}_{3}\) crucible. This growth method leads to crystals with clean surfaces and purity exceeding 99.995%.13 Sample AE388G, 18.4 mg in mass, was annealed in high pressure oxygen (100 bar) at low temperature (330 degC) during 230 h. By comparison with \(p\) and \(T\) values at equilibrium for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{x}\),14 the oxygen concentration is estimated to \(x\) \(\equiv\) 7.00. However, the superconducting transition is located 2.7 K above that of Y-123 annealed in the same conditions. High pressure oxidation suppresses the magnetic "fishtail" effect in Dy-123 above 70 K (Fig. 1) as it does for Y-123 (corresponding data are given in Figs. 1 and 2 of Ref. [10]). The enhanced reversibility is assigned with the suppression of clusters of oxygen vacancies which act as paramagnetic pinning centers.13 For the present purpose, the fishtail effect must be avoided because pinning distorts the periodicity of the vortex lattice. A strongly distorted lattice or a glass melts with a continuous transition.8,15

The present calorimetric measurements are carried out in a high resolution, continuous heating calorimeter.16 The field is applied or changed at \(T\) = 120 K to ensure field penetration; the sample is then cooled to 5 K, and data are collected during warming from 15 to 120 K (160 K in \(B\) = 0). Typical heating rates are 0.010 to 0.015 K/s. Gaps in the data at selected temperatures (e.g., 70 and 100 K) are due to measurements of the residual (\(\approx\)0.1%) nonadiabatic heat losses. The heat capacity of the sample holder (measured separately and subtracted) and that of the crystal are in the ratio \(\approx\)4:1 near _T_c The resulting random errors of the crystal data amount to 0.03 to 0.05%, whereas the accuracy, which is limited essentially by the evaluation of the heat capacity of the varnish adhesive, is about 2%. Alignment errors between the field and the crystallographic axes are estimated to +-2deg.

Figure 2 shows the total specific heat of Dy-123, together with literature data,17-19 compared to that of Y-123 over a wide temperature range. Low-temperature measurements have been shown to be consistent with magnetic ordering in a Kramer's doublet ground state at 0.90 K (the sample-dependent anomalies near 11 K are attributed to an

  impurity [17]) with additional entropy appearing from the admixture of higher-lying crystal field levels in the range of a few meV [18]. The excess entropy of Dy-123 with respect to Y-123 is 4.3_R_ln2 +- 10% at 150 K, taking into account the low-temperature measurements of Lee _et al._ below 5 K and those of van der Meulen _et al._ from 5 to 15 K. This is consistent with full lifting of the degeneracy of the \(J\) = \(\frac{15}{2}\) Gd\({}^{3+}\) ion, 4_R_ln2, together with a contribution from phonon shifts due to the heavier Dy mass, and possibly to the ordering of an impurity phase near 11 K in the literature data. In a field of 16 T, we observe a transfer of entropy from the region below 20 K (where the specific heat becomes smaller) to the 20-85 K range (where it grows).

Figure 3 shows the total _C_/_T_ in fields from \(B\) = 0 to 16 T by 1 T increments, _B_\(\parallel\)_c_. Figure 4 shows the same quantity for _B_\(\parallel\)_ab_, using 5.33 T increments. In the latter case, we have normalized the total specific heat near 98 K to its zero-field value, in order to compare it with data measured in _B_\(\parallel\)_c_ at lower fields. The fact that the symbols for _B_\(\parallel\)_ab_ = 5.33 T coincide with the line _B_\({}_{1c}\)= 1 T gives a robust determination of the anisotropy ratio \(\Gamma\) = (_m_\({}_{c}\)/_m_\({}_{ab}\))\({}^{1/2}\)= 5.3 \(\pm\) 0.5 (_m_\({}_{c}\) and _m_\({}_{ab}\) are the effective electron masses in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the \(c\) axis, respectively). This is confirmed by other couples of curves {_B_\(\parallel\)_ab_ = 10.67 T, _B_\({}_{1c}\)= 2 T} and {_B_\(\parallel\)_ab_ = 16 T, _B_\(\parallel\)_c_ = 3 T} (Fig. 4). The underlying assumption is that the variation of the specific heat is a function of _B_\(\xi^{2}(\theta)\), where \(e\) is the coherence length and _th_ the angle (\(\vec{B}\),\(\vec{c}\)), 15 the effective-mass approximation \(\xi^{2}(\theta)\) = \(\xi^{2}(0)(\Gamma^{-2}\)sin\({}^{2}\theta\)+ cos\({}^{2}\theta)^{1/2}\). Therefore the requirement that \(C(T,B_{1},\theta\) = 0) = _C_(_T_,_B_\({}_{2}\theta\) = _m_/2) implies _B_\({}_{1}\xi^{2}(0)\) = _B_\({}_{2}\xi^{2}(\pi/2)\) and finally _B_\({}_{2}\

 argument explains the presence of weak structures at the noise limit at the locations marked by arrows in Fig. 6.

The position of the C peaks and steps are reported in the phase diagram of Fig. 7. Although we cannot measure the corresponding M jumps and breaks in fields from 6 to 16 T because of the limitations of standard SQUID magnetometers, a comparison with extensive data in the literature [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] leaves little doubt that the line defined in this way is the melting line \(B_{m}(T)\) of the vortex solid. A fit with the function \(B_{m} = B_{0}(1 - T/T_{c})^{n}\) yields the parameters \(B_{0} = 133\) T and \(n = 1.29\), using \(T_{c} = 89.87\) K from the peak value of \(C(B = 0) - C(B = 16\) T); using rather \(T_{c} = 90.16\) K from the inflection point in \(B = 0\) (which seems to be a better choice, see Ref. [20]), we find \(B_{0} = 139\) T and \(n = 1.33\). These values are very close to the corresponding parameters for Y-123, which are \(B_{0} = 133\) to 140 T and \(n = 1.30\) to 1.33.[10] The value of the exponent strongly suggests a relation with criticality, which leads naturally to \(n \cong \frac{1}{3}\).[15] The description based on Lindemann's criterion outside of the critical regime rather leads to \(n = 2\), but adjustments are possible.[22]

The phase diagram shown in Fig. 7 displays two interesting features: first the absence, within the range of available fields, of an upper multicritical point terminating the line of first-order transitions, and second the existence of a lower critical point at 6\(\pm 1\) T separating first-order from continuous transitions. Both features confirm the observations made on twinned YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.00}\).[10] A crossover to a quasi-2D system is expected when the field is large enough to decouple the CuO\({}_{2}\) layers, and is indeed observed near 10 T in oxygen-deficient Y-123 with a larger anisotropy,[1, 9] and in Bi-2212 near 0.04 to 0.1 T.[3, 4] Our measurements set a lower limit of 16 T for such a multicritical point. This is more compatible with Josephson coupling of vortices, characterized by a crossover field of \(\Phi_{0}/\Gamma^{2}s^{2} \approx 50\) T in the present case (\(s\) = interplanar distance), than with magnetic coupling, characterized by \(\Phi_{0}/\Lambda_{ab}^{2} \approx 0.1\) T. Both 123 compounds differ drastically from Bi-2212 in this respect.

On the low field side, the present data show that the first-order-like peak disappears below 6 T. Experiments on YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.00}\) at 4 T have shown that the peak can be recovered neither by detwinning the sample,[11] nor by tilting the field with respect to the \(c\) axis,[10] tending to rule out an explanation in terms of correlated disorder introduced by twin boundary pinning. The presence of a lower critical point near 6 T is now confirmed in three high-quality 123 crystals in the overdoped state;[10] when the oxygen concentration decreases, the point moves to lower fields.[9] The possibility that the 6-T point is an intrinsic property of fully oxidized 123 phases with a low anisotropy cannot be excluded at the present time; however, additional experiments on fully oxidized untwinned and strain-free crystals are still required to ascertain

  this issue. Different theoretical approaches predict the existence of a lower critical point.[23, 24]

The value of the entropy jump \(\Delta S\) at high fields was evaluated by integrating the excess \(C/T\) as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. The average value is \(0.5\pm 0.1k_{B}\) per vortex and per layer, with a tendency to increase with temperature. This is close to the result \(0.6\pm 0.1k_{B}\) /vortex/layer obtained for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.00}\),[10] and more generally to other magnetic and thermal determinations for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{x}\) in the literature.[5, 6, 7] A jump component can be discerned below the peaks, confirming that the specific heat of the vortex liquid is larger than the specific heat of the vortex solid.[7, 8, 9, 10]

Dy-123 is the second compound in which the _thermal_ signature of vortex melting is detected, the only other example being Y-123. The specific heat peaks suggest that the vortex lattice melts with a first-order transition, but an unambiguous confirmation requires independent experiments such as the observation of hysteresis.[11] The anisotropy ratio, the melting entropy, the absence of an upper critical point, the presence of a lower critical point and the shape of the melting line are practically identical to those of fully oxidized Y-123.[10] These results, which form a first step towards the generalization of the Y-123 findings, show in particular that the vortex system is insensitive to the presence of magnetic moments on the Dy/Y site.
