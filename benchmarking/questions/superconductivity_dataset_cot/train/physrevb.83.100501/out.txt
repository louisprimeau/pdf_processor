###### Abstract

We have carried out high-field resistivity measurements up to 27 T in EuFe_{2}As_{2} at P = 2.5 GPa, a virtually optimal pressure for the P-induced superconductivity, where T_{\rm c} = 30 K. The B_{\rm c2}-T_{\rm c} phase diagram has been constructed in a wide temperature range with a minimum temperature of 1.6 K (\approx0.05 \timesT_{\rm c}), for both B | ab (B_{\rm c2}^{\rm h}) and B | c (B_{\rm c2}^{\rm h}). The upper critical fields B_{\rm c2}^{\rm h}(0) and B_{\rm c2}^{\rm h}(0), determined by the onset of resistive transitions, are 25 and 22 T, respectively, which are significantly smaller than those of other Fe-based superconductors with similar values of T_{\rm c}. The small B_{\rm c2}(0) values and the B_{\rm c2}(T) curves with positive curvature around 20 K can be explained by a multiple pair-breaking model that includes the exchange field due to the magnetic Eu^{2+} moments. The anisotropy parameter, \Gamma=B_{\rm c2}^{\rm h}/B_{\rm c2}^{\rm h}, in EuFe_{2}As_{2} at low temperatures is comparable to that of other "122" Fe-based systems.

The discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAs(O,F) at T_{\rm c} = 26 K [1] has inspired experimental and theoretical research on a group of FeAs-layered superconductors (SCs). [2] Basically, Fe-based high-T_{\rm c} superconductivity [3, 4, 5] occurs when the antiferromagnetic (AF) order in the mother compounds is suppressed by means of carrier doping, [1] application of pressure (P), [6] or isovalent substitution. [7] As compared to other methods in studying such interplay between magnetism and superconductivity, pressure experiments have a significant advantage in that they are free from random impurity potentials that may distort the underlying physics of the low-lying energy states. Among the various crystal structures, tetragonal ThCr_{2}Si_{2}-type ("122") compounds have been investigated more intensively owing to the availability of highly pure stoichiometric single crystals. In particular, AFFe_{2}As_{2} (A = Sr, Eu) exhibits P-induced bulk superconductivity with T_{\rm c} of order 30 K. [8, 9] In contrast, superconductivity under hydrostatic pressure is not exhibited by CaFe_{2}As_{2}, [10] and its occurrence in BaFe_{2}As_{2} has not been established definitively. [8, 11]

A fundamental characteristic of SCs is the upper critical field B_{\rm c2}. B_{\rm c2} has its roots in the breakdown of Cooper pairs; hence, the B_{\rm c2}-T_{\rm c} phase diagram provides important insights into the pairing mechanism of high-T_{\rm c} superconductivity. Thus far, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on B_{\rm c2} for P-induced Fe-based SCs at low temperatures. This is mainly attributed to the difficulty in conducting high-pressure experiments on high-T_{\rm c} SCs under a high field. In the case of SrFe_{2}As_{2} (T_{\rm c} = 30 K at 4.2 GPa), a field of 8 T brings about a small reduction in T_{\rm c} (i.e., to 27 K) for B | ab. [13] Assuming an orbitally limited case, [12]B_{\rm c2} (T = 0 K) could exceed 60 T. [13] However, the low temperature region of the B_{\rm c2} curve, where paramagnetic and/or multiband effects may play important roles, [14] merits investigation.

In the case of EuFe_{2}As_{2} (T_{\rm c} = 30 K at \sim2.5 GPa), B_{\rm c2} is relatively small (i.e., \sim16 T between 5 and 10 K) [9] and hence can be traced down to very low temperatures. EuFe_{2}As_{2} is unique in that the localized Eu^{2+} moments exhibit an AF order below 20 K [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] in addition to an AF order arising from the FeAs layers at T_{0}\sim190 K. T_{\rm N} of the Eu^{2+} moments is insensitive to pressure, and the AF order occurs in the P-induced superconducting state as evidenced by magnetic and heat capacity measurements under high pressure. [20, 21, 9, 22] Despite the AF order, which is produced by a weak interlayer interaction, the dominant interaction among the Eu^{2+} moments is the intralayer ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, and hence the FM alignment of the Eu^{2+} moments is easily achieved by the application of 1 \sim 2 T even below T_{\rm N} at ambient pressure as well as under high pressure. [20, 18, 21, 9, 23, 24] Thus, EuFe_{2}As_{2} provides an excellent opportunity where a long-standing issue of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism can be studied in a high-T_{\rm c} material using high-quality single crystals.

In this report, we present the B_{\rm c2}-T_{\rm c} phase diagram of EuFe_{2}As_{2} at a pressure of 2.5 GPa and minimum temperature of 1.6 K via high-field resistivity measurements up to 27 T, and discuss the origin of the distinctive B_{\rm c2} curves.

Single crystals of EuFe_{2}As_{2} were prepared via the Bridgman method from a stoichiometric mixture of the constituent elements. The samples analyzed in this study were obtained from the same batch (residual resistivity ratio RR = 7) as that used in Refs. [9, 21], and [23]. The resistivity of two samples, denoted by ^{\rm h}1 and ^{\rm g}2, was simultaneously measured at P = 2.5 GPa via an ac four-probe method in a ^{4}He cryostat (T\geqslant 1.6 K). Sample ^{\rm h}1 (^{\rm g}2) was aligned with the ab plane (c axis) parallel to the longitudinal direction of a hybrid-type piston cylinder pressure cell [25] for B | ab (\parallel c) measurements. For both samples, the magnetic field was applied along the piston cylinder axis in a direction perpendicular to that of the current. To generate hydrostatic pressure, Daphne 7474 (Idemitsu Kosan) oil, which remains in the liquid state up to 3.7 GPa at room temperature, [26] was used as the pressure-transmitting medium. The samples were gradually cooled at an average rate of 0.5 K/min. The pressure was calibrated at 4.2 K by the resistance change of a Manganin wire.[9] Magnetic fields up to 27 T were produced by a water-cooled resistive magnet installed at the Tsukuba Magnet Laboratory, National Institute for Materials Science. A 17-T superconducting magnet was used for preliminary resistivity studies. In this study, the magnetic field B denotes an externally applied field, and the magnetization within a sample (up to \sim0.9 T^{23}) is neglected.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity, \rho(T), for the two samples, *1 and *2, at P=2.5 GPa in the absence of an applied field. For both samples, \rho exhibits virtually T-linear dependence in the broad temperature range above T_{\rm c} without any anomaly due to the AF order of the FeAs layers. This observation is consistent with the phase diagram shown in the inset:[20, 29]P=2.5 GPa is just above the critical pressure P_{\rm c}, where T_{0}\to 0, as indicated by the arrow. Similar \rho\sim T behavior was also reported in several optimally doped Fe-based SCs.[27, 28] However, the reason for such behavior is unclear. Both samples exhibit a sharp transition to zero resistivity at T_{\rm c}=30 K; the reentrant-like behavior as reported in Ref. [20] is not observed for either sample at this pressure. Our previous work[21] indicates that reentrant-like behavior may be observed for P<P_{\rm c} but not for P>P_{\rm c} (as long as P is not far from P_{\rm c}) in our single crystals. Since both T_{\rm c} and B_{\rm c2} attain maximum values at P\approx P_{\rm c}, followed by a monotonic decrease with increasing P,[29]B_{\rm c2} determined at 2.5 GPa in this study is expected to be close to its maximum value.

Figures 2(a)-2(d) shows the resistivity of EuFe_{2}As_{2} at 2.5 GPa as a function of B and T for the two orientations B\parallel ab and B\parallel c. A magnetic field of 27 T is sufficient to recover the normal state at the minimum temperature, 1.6 K (\approx0.5 \timesT_{\rm c}), for both orientations. Using the data in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), the B_{\rm c2}-T_{\rm c} phase diagram of EuFe_{2}As_{2} is constructed for B\parallel ab at 2.5 GPa, as shown in Fig. 3. Three sets--B_{\rm c2}^{\rm eq} (onset), and B_{\rm c2}^{\rm eq} (x=0 and 50, x% of the normal state resistivity \rho_{\rm n})--are plotted, and their definitions are illustrated in the inset. The solid and open symbols are obtained from the \rho(B) and \rho(T) measurements, respectively. B_{\rm c2}^{\rm 0} is consistent with the previous result (\times) obtained from the ac-\chi measurement for B\parallel ab.[9] Note that all the curves of B_{\rm c2} for B\parallel ab (B_{\rm c2}^{\rm ab}) obtained under different criteria exhibit qualitatively similar T dependence. The same is also true for B_{\rm c2} for B\parallel c (B_{\rm c2}^{\rm eq}), as shown in Fig. 4(a). T_{\rm N} at zero field is indicated by an arrow in Figs. 3 and 4. However, we note that, since the AF order of the Eu^{2+} moments is destroyed by an applied field of \sim1 T,^{9} the B_{\rm c2} curves for both B\parallel ab and B\parallel c are in the paramagnetic or field-induced FM state of the Eu^{2+} moments.

A distinctive feature, the concave (upward) curvature of B_{\rm c2}^{\rm ab} around 20 K, seems to be absent from other Fe-based SCs without localized magnetic ions. Therefore, it is likely related to the magnetic state of the Eu^{2+} moments. Similar concave B_{\rm c2}(T) curves have been reported in Chevrel-phase compounds such as (Eu,M)Mo_{6}S_{8} (M= Sn,[30] La,[31] etc.) and EuMo_{6}S_{8} under pressure.[32] In these systems, the conduction electrons are subjected to an exchange field B_{J} in addition to an applied field via AF coupling with the Eu^{2+} localized magnetic moments. Note that the concave curvature is an indication of the negative sign of B_{J}; B_{J} is antiparallel to the applied field.[32, 33] Within a multiple pair-breaking picture, B_{\rm c2} in the dirty limit of three-dimensional SCs with negative B_{J} can be expressed by[34, 12]

\[\ln\frac{1}{t} = \left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i\lambda_{\rm so}}{4\gamma}\right)\times \Psi\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{h+i\lambda_{\rm so}/2+i\gamma}{2t}\right)\] (1) \[+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i\lambda_{\rm so}}{4\gamma}\right)\times \Psi\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{h+i\lambda_{\rm so}/2-i\gamma}{2t}\right)-\Psi \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\] \[\gamma = \left[\alpha^{2}(h+h_{J})^{2}-\lambda_{\rm so}^{2}\right]^{\frac{1 }{2}},\]

where \Psi and \lambda_{\rm so} are the digamma function and spin-orbit scattering parameter, respectively. The magnetic scattering

The inset illustrates the T-P phase diagram of EuFe_{2}As_{2}.[29]T_{0} and T_{\rm N} denote the temperatures of the AF order arising from the FeAs layers and localized Eu^{2+} moments, respectively. The solid circles denote T_{\rm c} determined under the criterion \rho=0. The crosses denote the values obtained from Ref. [20].

  parameter \lambda_{\rm m} used in the complete formula [12, 34] is typically ignored for simplicity [32, 35]. The Maki parameter \alpha is defined as \sqrt{2}B_{\rm c2}^{*}/B_{\rm p}, using the orbital critical field B_{\rm c3}^{*} at T\!=\!0 and the Pauli-Clogston paramagnetic limit B_{\rm p}^{0}[16]. Reduced units--t\!=\!T/T_{\rm c}, h\!=\!0.281B_{\rm c2}/B_{\rm c2}^{*}, and h_{J}\!=\!0.281B_{J}/B_{\rm c2}^{*}--are employed. We assume B_{J}\!=\!\betaM (\beta: constant), where the magnetization M is modeled within a molecular-field approximation [37]. To simplify the following discussions, \alpha for B\parallel ab is set to 3, a typical value for "122" systems.

The solid curve in Fig. 3 was calculated from Eq. (1) for B_{\rm c2}^{0} data with T_{\rm c} set to the experimental value T_{\rm c}\!=\!29 K. The fit yields a parameter set (\lambda_{\infty}, \beta) = (7.9, -187). \beta\!=\!-187 indicates that the maximum of |B_{J}|, B_{J}^{n}, is around 168 T. The fit captures the qualitative characteristics of the experimental B_{\rm c2}^{0} curve satisfactorily, especially the positive curvature below T_{\rm N}\!=\!20 K, and shows that the low value of B_{\rm c2} (compared to other Fe-based SCs' with similar T_{\rm c} values) is due to the large B_{J}, which is a consequence of a large Eu^{2+} magnetization due to the field-induced FM alignment of the Eu^{2+} moments. However, its deviation from the experimental curve is also noticeable at low fields near T_{\rm c}. This disagreement probably indicates that the phase diagram in this T-range is affected by a subtle competition between superconductivity and magnetic fluctuations, and it is beyond the scope of Eq. (1), which assumes a homogeneous B_{J} produced by paramagnetic spins. Since the dominant interaction among the Eu^{2+} moments is the intralayer FM interaction [18, 19, 23, 22], the FM fluctuations develop when T is lowered to T_{\rm N}, as evidenced by the enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility as T\to T_{\rm N}[9, 19, 23]. Such FM fluctuations may be detrimental to superconductivity. One way to phenomenologically overcome this problem and to improve the fit in a T-range not close to T_{\rm c} is to use a reduced value of T_{\rm c}. Thus, the three dotted curves are calculated using the reduced T_{\rm c} value. They reproduce the experimental curves excellently over the entire T-range, with a minimum temperature of 1.6 K. For B_{\rm c2}^{0}, we assumed (\lambda_{\rm so}, \beta, T_{\rm c}) = (2.7, -83, 24 K), where B_{J}^{n}\sim 75 T. Here, it may be worthwhile to compare the parameters with those of the Chevrel compounds. The comparison revealed that he obtained \lambda_{\rm so} is comparable to that found in the Chevrel-type Eu compounds [32, 35], and B_{J}^{m} in EuFe_{2}As_{2} is a few times greater than that reported in the Chevrel-type Eu compounds [32, 35]. We note that the concave curvature of B_{\rm c2} in EuFe_{2}As_{2} essentially differs from the positive curvatures often observed in highly two-dimensional SCs such as high-T_{\rm c} cuprates. In the latter, the curvature is highly dependent on what criterion is chosen to define B_{\rm c2}, and it is most likely affected by the vortex lattice phase transitions (i.e., from a vortex-liquid state to a vortex-solid state) [38].

Figure 4(a) shows the B_{\rm c2}\!-\!T_{\rm c} phase diagram of EuFe_{2}As_{2} for B\parallel c at 2.5 GPa [39], determined in the same manner as that used for B_{\rm c2}^{0}. A concave curvature around 20 K is also visible for the B_{\rm c2}^{0} curves. The dashed curves are calculated using the parameters comparable to those used for B_{\rm c2}^{0}, that is, for B_{\rm c2}^{0}, the fit gives (\alpha, \lambda_{\rm so}) = (1.9, 2.6) when we assume

The values of R_{\rm c2} are determined under three different criteria, as illustrated for \rho(B) data at 4.2 K (inset). The solid or open symbols denote B_{\rm c2} determined from \rho(B) and \rho(T) measurements, respectively. The solid and dashed curves are fits to Eq. (1). \times denotes the previous B_{\rm c2}^{0} result deduced from an ac-\chi measurement for B\parallel ab. [9] The arrow indicates T_{\rm N} of Eu^{2+} moments in the superconducting state in the absence of an applied field at 2.6 GPa [2]

 (_b_, _T_c) = (-83, 24 K), identical to the values used for B_{\rm c2}^{ab}. The calculated curves tend to saturate below 3 K, whereas the experimental curves appear to increase linearly as T decreases to zero. The unsaturation of B_{\rm c2}^{c} has been observed in other Fe-based SCs, [14, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91,

Therefore, it is likely related to the magnetic state of the Eu^{2+} moments. Similar concave B_{\rm c2}(T) curves have been reported in Chevrel-phase compounds such as (Eu,M)Mo_{6}S_{8} (M= Sn,[30] La,[31] etc.) and EuMo_{6}S_{8} under pressure.[32] In these systems, the conduction electrons are subjected to an exchange field B_{J} in addition to an applied field via AF coupling with the Eu^{2+} localized magnetic moments. Note that the concave curvature is an indication of the negative sign of B_{J}; B_{J} is antiparallel to the applied field.[32, 33] Within a multiple pair-breaking picture, B_{\rm c2} in the dirty limit of three-dimensional SCs with negative B_{J} can be expressed by[34, 12]

\[\ln\frac{1}{t} = \left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i\lambda_{\rm so}}{4\gamma}\right)\times \Psi\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{h+i\lambda_{\rm so}/2+i\gamma}{2t}\right)\] (1) \[+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i\lambda_{\rm so}}{4\gamma}\right)\times \Psi\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{h+i\lambda_{\rm so}/2-i\gamma}{2t}\right)-\Psi \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\] \[\gamma = \left[\alpha^{2}(h+h_{J})^{2}-\lambda_{\rm so}^{2}\right]^{\frac{1 }{2}},\]

where \Psi and \lambda_{\rm so} are the digamma function and spin-orbit scattering parameter, respectively. The magnetic scattering

The inset illustrates the T-P phase diagram of EuFe_{2}As_{2}.[29]T_{0} and T_{\rm N} denote the temperatures of the AF order arising from the FeAs layers and localized Eu^{2+} moments, respectively. The solid circles denote T_{\rm c} determined under the criterion \rho=0. The crosses denote the values obtained from Ref. [20].

  parameter \lambda_{\rm m} used in the complete formula [12, 34] is typically ignored for simplicity [32, 35]. The Maki parameter \alpha is defined as \sqrt{2}B_{\rm c2}^{*}/B_{\rm p}, using the orbital critical field B_{\rm c3}^{*} at T\!=\!0 and the Pauli-Clogston paramagnetic limit B_{\rm p}^{0}[16]. Reduced units--t\!=\!T/T_{\rm c}, h\!=\!0.281B_{\rm c2}/B_{\rm c2}^{*}, and h_{J}\!=\!0.281B_{J}/B_{\rm c2}^{*}--are employed. We assume B_{J}\!=\!\betaM (\beta: constant), where the magnetization M is modeled within a molecular-field approximation [37]. To simplify the following discussions, \alpha for B\parallel ab is set to 3, a typical value for "122" systems.

The solid curve in Fig. 3 was calculated from Eq. (1) for B_{\rm c2}^{0} data with T_{\rm c} set to the experimental value T_{\rm c}\!=\!29 K. The fit yields a parameter set (\lambda_{\infty}, \beta) = (7.9, -187). \beta\!=\!-187 indicates that the maximum of |B_{J}|, B_{J}^{n}, is around 168 T. The fit captures the qualitative characteristics of the experimental B_{\rm c2}^{0} curve satisfactorily, especially the positive curvature below T_{\rm N}\!=\!20 K, and shows that the low value of B_{\rm c2} (compared to other Fe-based SCs' with similar T_{\rm c} values) is due to the large B_{J}, which is a consequence of a large Eu^{2+} magnetization due to the field-induced FM alignment of the Eu^{2+} moments. However, its deviation from the experimental curve is also noticeable at low fields near T_{\rm c}. This disagreement probably indicates that the phase diagram in this T-range is affected by a subtle competition between superconductivity and magnetic fluctuations, and it is beyond the scope of Eq. (1), which assumes a homogeneous B_{J} produced by paramagnetic spins. Since the dominant interaction among the Eu^{2+} moments is the intralayer FM interaction [18, 19, 23, 22], the FM fluctuations develop when T is lowered to T_{\rm N}, as evidenced by the enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility as T\to T_{\rm N}[9, 19, 23]. Such FM fluctuations may be detrimental to superconductivity. One way to phenomenologically overcome this problem and to improve the fit in a T-range not close to T_{\rm c} is to use a reduced value of T_{\rm c}. Thus, the three dotted curves are calculated using the reduced T_{\rm c} value. They reproduce the experimental curves excellently over the entire T-range, with a minimum temperature of 1.6 K. For B_{\rm c2}^{0}, we assumed (\lambda_{\rm so}, \beta, T_{\rm c}) = (2.7, -83, 24 K), where B_{J}^{n}\sim 75 T. Here, it may be worthwhile to compare the parameters with those of the Chevrel compounds. The comparison revealed that he obtained \lambda_{\rm so} is comparable to that found in the Chevrel-type Eu compounds [32, 35], and B_{J}^{m} in EuFe_{2}As_{2} is a few times greater than that reported in the Chevrel-type Eu compounds [32, 35]. We note that the concave curvature of B_{\rm c2} in EuFe_{2}As_{2} essentially differs from the positive curvatures often observed in highly two-dimensional SCs such as high-T_{\rm c} cuprates. In the latter, the curvature is highly dependent on what criterion is chosen to define B_{\rm c2}, and it is most likely affected by the vortex lattice phase transitions (i.e., from a vortex-liquid state to a vortex-solid state) [38].

Figure 4(a) shows the B_{\rm c2}\!-\!T_{\rm c} phase diagram of EuFe_{2}As_{2} for B\parallel c at 2.5 GPa [39], determined in the same manner as that used for B_{\rm c2}^{0}. A concave curvature around 20 K is also visible for the B_{\rm c2}^{0} curves. The dashed curves are calculated using the parameters comparable to those used for B_{\rm c2}^{0}, that is, for B_{\rm c2}^{0}, the fit gives (\alpha, \lambda_{\rm so}) = (1.9, 2.6) when we assume

The values of R_{\rm c2} are determined under three different criteria, as illustrated for \rho(B) data at 4.2 K (inset). The solid or open symbols denote B_{\rm c2} determined from \rho(B) and \rho(T) measurements, respectively. The solid and dashed curves are fits to Eq. (1). \times denotes the previous B_{\rm c2}^{0} result deduced from an ac-\chi measurement for B\parallel ab.

 (_b_, _T_c) = (-83, 24 K), identical to the values used for B_{\rm c2}^{ab}. The calculated curves tend to saturate below 3 K, whereas the experimental curves appear to increase linearly as T decreases to zero. The unsaturation of B_{\rm c2}^{c} has been observed in other Fe-based SCs, [14, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91,
