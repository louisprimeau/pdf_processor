###### Abstract

Powder neutron diffraction analysis on ^{11}B-enriched samples of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B confirms the stability, down to liquid helium temperatures, of their antiperovskite structure (space group P432). The low-temperature normal-state specific heats (measured within the range 400 mK <_T_<20 K and _H_\leq70 koE) follow a superposition of a linear and a cubic term: for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B the Sommerfeld coefficient \gamma =9.0(1) mJ/mol K^{2} and the Debye temperature \theta_{D}=221(1) K while for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, \gamma=7.0(1) mJ/mol K^{2} and \theta_{D}=228(1) K. Their thermodynamic superconducting temperatures _T_c are, respectively, 7.5(3) K and 2.17(5) K while \DeltaC/_gT_c are 2.0(3) and 1.39(3). The thermal evolution of the superconducting specific heat of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is C_{\rm ex}(_T_<_T_c)=22\gamma_T_c exp(-2.1_T_c/_T_) J/mol K while for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is C_{\rm ex}(_T_<_T_c)=8.5\gamma_T_c \timesexp(-1.42\gamma_T_c/_T_) J/mol K. The analysis of these features, within the framework of the strong-coupled theory, suggests that Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is weakly coupled BCS-type superconductor [_T_c/_o_log\rightarrow0, \lambda=0.48(2), _N_(_E_F_) =1.00(2) states/eV/formula unit, and 2\Delta_{0}/_T_c=3.53] while Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is an intermediate-coupled BCS-type superconductor [_T_c/_o_log=0.068(5), \lambda=1.09(7), _N_(_E_F_)=0.91(4) states/eV/formula unit, and 2\Delta_{0}/_T_c=3.94(4)].

## I Introduction

Recently superconductivity has been discovered in the antiperovskites Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (Ref. 1) and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (Refs. 2 and 3). These compounds crystallize [4] in the cubic space group P432, wherein the Pd/Pt atoms are arranged at the vertices of distorted octahedra that are centered by a B ion. The octahedra share all vertices and as such form an extended three-dimensional framework. Each of the Li atoms--situated in the space between the distorted octahedra--is surrounded by three Li nearest neighbors at a distance of 2.55 A; such a Li-Li distance is less than that found in the Li metal (3.04 A), a feature considered by Eibenstein and Jung [4] as indicative of electronic charge transfer from lithium to the Pd/B (Pt/B) network. It is not yet clear whether this charge transfer is the driving mechanism behind the surge of the superconductivity in these metal-rich borides; nonetheless, the presence of both a shorter Li-Li distance and a distorted octahedral remains a remarkable structural property, which deserves further studies. This work, utilizing the neutron powder diffraction analysis with it superior sensitivity for the lighter Li and B atoms, reports on the structural properties of these compounds with particular attention to their structural stability when the temperature is decreased down to the superconducting region.

The structural and normal-state properties of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B are very similar. Both show similar metallic-type resistivity, [2, 3] with the same magnitude, the same thermal evolution, and the same ratio \rho_{300} K/\rho_{10} K =1.4. In addition, electronic structure calculations [5] show that there is a similarity in the electron density distribution of both compounds, that the density of state at the Fermi level _N_(_E_F_) is due predominantly to the d orbitals of the Pd/Pt atoms hybridized with B _2p_ and Li _2p_ states, [6, 7, 8] and that the total _N_(_E_F_) is larger in Li_{2}Pt_{3}B than that in Li_{2}Pd_{3}B.

The superconducting parameters of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B are substantially enhanced as compared to that of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (e.g., the superconducting transition point _T_c of the former is three times higher than that of the latter). [2, 3, 9] Such a tendency is clearly manifested in the systematic studies on the solid solution Li_{2}(Pt_{x}Pd_{1-x})_{3}B. [2, 3] as a matter of fact, _T_c varies almost linearly with x. Considering the remarkable similarity between their structural and normal-state electronic properties and, furthermore, that there are no obvious pair-breaking mechanism(s), it is then surprising that their superconducting properties, in particular _T_c, are much different. It is then of interest to investigate the cause of such a variation and as well the pairing mechanism in these metal-rich ternary borides and therefrom deduce the origin of the almost linear behavior of _T_c with x. As a contribution in that direction, it is most appropriate to undertake specific heat measurements so as to probe the low-temperature thermal and electronic properties of the two end members of this series. Then it is possible to judge whether there is any correlation between the superconductivity, the thermal/electronic properties, and the content of the Pt/Pd atoms. With that objective in mind, in this work we report on the specific-heat measurements on Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and  Li_{2}Pt_{3}B within the range 0.4 K < T< 20 K and in a magnetic field up to 70 kOe (a limit that is higher than H_{c2}).

## II Experimental

Samples were prepared by a two-stage arc-melting process (for details, see Ref. 1). Basic characterizations such as room-temperature x-ray diffraction, magnetization, and resistivity were carried out, and the obtained results are in good agreement with the published data.[2, 3, 4] This is particularly valid for the XRD results, however, since the x-ray diffractometry is less sensitive to the lighter elements, we also carried out powder neutron diffraction analysis on ^{11}B-enriched samples. These measurements were carried out between 2 and 300 K at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France; patterns of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B were collected using the D1A diffractometer with a selected \lambda = 1.91 A while for those of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, the D2B diffractometer was used with \lambda = 1.595 A. Rietveld refinements were carried out using the fullprof package of Rodriguez-Carvajal (L. L. B.).

The specific heat measurements were carried out on two different types of calorimeters. A zero-field semadiabatic calorimeter operated within the range 400 mK < T< 20 K and having a precision of better than 4%. The other is a relaxation-type calorimeter (a commercial one from Quantum Design) that was operated within the range 2 K < T< 20 K and H \leq 70 kOe.

## III Results and Analysis

### Neutron powder diffraction

The low-temperature diffractograms of both compounds are shown in Fig. 1. The results of the refinements (see Table 1) confirm the room-temperature structural model of Eibenstein and Jung:[4] within our statistics and considering the temperature difference, all the parameters (specifically position, occupation, and anisotropic thermal parameters) are almost equal to the reported ones.[4] For the particular case of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, the a parameter is 6.7465(1) A at 300 K while 6.7345(1) A at 2 K: only a 0.18% difference that is due to thermal contraction. It is worth recalling that, due to the Li nonstoichiometry, there is some minor variation among the lattice parameters of different patches of the same compound, even when measured at the same temperature.

The position parameters of Li and Pt/Pd atoms that are not fixed by symmetry are very similar to those of Eibenstein and Jung[4] (see Table 1) and, in addition, they do not show any noticeable variation on going from 300 down to 2 K. Based on these and the above-mentioned findings, it is inferred that the basic room-temperature structural features remains unaltered. Specifically, the Li-Li distance is hardly modified on lowering the temperature; as a consequence the charge transfer to the T/B network, if solely governed by Li-Li distance, is unaffected by such temperature variations.

### Specific heat

The specific heat of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is shown in Fig. 2. Its normal state properties were achieved after quenching the superconductivity in a magnetic field of 70 kOe (>H_{c2}).[1] Under such a condition, the normal-state specific heat is adequately described by a superposition of a Sommerfeld (\gamma_T_) and Debye (\beta_T_^{3}) term: in a region of 2 K < T< 5 K, the normal-state coefficients are \gamma=9.0(1) mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta=1.08(1) mJ/mol K^{4}.

The zero-field specific heat of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is shown in Fig. 3. Its normal-state specific heat was analyzed as a sum of a linear and a cubic term; here also the analysis had been limited to the range T_{c} < T< 5 K. The fit is excellent, giving \gamma=7.0(1) mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta=0.98(1) mJ/mol K^{4}. Assuming no (drastic) modification in the normal-state properties due to the 70 kOe field, a comparison of \gamma and \beta of the two compounds (see Table 2) suggests that for the case of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, \gamma is almost 30% higher while the Debye temperature, \theta_{\rm D}, is only 3% lower; evidently only the difference between their \gamma is significant. Such an enhancement of \gamma could be due to an increase in the single-spin electron density of state at the Fermi level N(E_{F}) or in the electronic mass-enhancement parameter \lambda:

\[\gamma=\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda)N(E_{F}).\] (1)

As \lambda appears also in expressions governing the superconducting properties of these compounds (see below), then it is possible to evaluate separately each of N(E_{F}) and \lambda; in an

For each panel, symbols represent the total measured diffraction intensity while the solid line gives the calculated pattern. The difference curve is shown at the bottom while the Bragg positions are indicated as short bars. Some refined parameters are given in Table 1. The reliability factors for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (having, relatively, better statistics) are R_{B}=5.5 and R_{F}=3.9.

  ticipation, the enhancement of \gamma is due mainly to an increase in \lambda (see below).

From the analysis of the specific heats at the onset of the superconducting state (Figs. 2 and 3) and utilizing the balance of entropy (see the inset of Fig. 3), we extracted the values of T_{c} and \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} (the specific-heat jump at T_{c}): T_{c} of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is 7.5(2) K while that of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is 2.17(5) K (both agree very well with the reported values [1, 3]). \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} is 2.0(3) for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B while 1.39(3) for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B: since for a standard BCS superconductor \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}=1.43, it is evident that Li_{2}Pt_{3}B agrees quite reasonably with the weakly-coupled BCS prediction, but Li_{2}Pd_{3}B deviates appreciably due to strong-coupling effects (see below). It is worth mentioning that for the particular case of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, the large errors in \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} and T_{c} are due to an almost-1 K-broadened-transition region, which, according to Togano _et al._, [1] is due to the nonstoichiometry of lithium. For this reason, we did not evaluate the thermal evolution of \Delta C(T)/\gamma T in the neighborhood of T_{c} nor its thermal derivative at T_{c}.

The analysis of the electronic specific heat within the superconducting phase C_{\rm es}(T) of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is shown in Fig. 4 while that of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B in Fig. 5. Evidently in both figures, C_{\rm es}(T) reflects clearly an exponential behavior, indicative of a gap character. For Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, the solid line represents C_{\rm es}(T)=22\gamma T_{c} exp(-2.17_{c}/_T_) J/mol K while for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, C_{\rm es}(T)=8.5\gamma T_{c} exp(-1.42T_{c}/_T_) J/mol K. It is recalled that for a weak-coupled BCS superconductor, [10]C_{\rm es}(T) =8.5\gamma T_{c} exp(-1.44T_{c}/_T_) for 2.5<T_{c}/_T_<6, C_{\rm es}(T) =26\gamma T_{c} exp(-1.62T_{c}/_T_) for 7<T_{c}/_T_<12, and C_{\rm es}(T) =3.15\gamma T_{c}(T_{c}/_T_){  is considered to be due to strong-coupling corrections.

Finally, the ratio \theta_{D,{\rm P}_{\rm i}}\sqrt{M_{\rm Pl}}/(\theta_{D,{\rm pd}}\sqrt{M_{\rm pd}}) \approx 1.4 is 40% higher than expected. Similarly, the partial isotope relation T_{c,{\rm P}_{\rm i}}\sqrt{M_{\rm Pl}}/T_{c,{\rm pd}}\sqrt{M_{\rm pd}}\approx 0.4 is 60% away from the prediction of the standard BCS model. The difficulty in controlling the Li stoichiometry discouraged us from studying the isotope effect in these superconductors: it was reported earlier [1] that T_{c} strongly depends on the stoichiometry of the Li atom, reminiscent of the carbon nonstoichiometry in the similar antiperovskite MgCNi_{3}.[11] A similar Li dependence of T_{c} is expected to be present in the Li_{2}(Pt_{x}Pd_{1-x})_{3}B series,[2, 3] however, such a nonstoichiometry cannot account for the linear decrease of T_{c} with x.

## IV Discussion and Conclusion

According to the above-shown specific heats, the low-temperature normal-state electronic and thermal properties of the studied compounds can be described, respectively, within the Sommerfeld and Debye approximations. The range of \gamma indicates a conventional Fermi liquid behavior. Further, the bulk character of their superconductivities is clearly revealed and that the evolution of their specific heat within the superconducting phase is indicative of a thermal activation across a superconducting gap: for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B the conventional gapped superconductivity is in line with the findings of Nishiyama _et al.[7]_ On checking this exponential character and the ranges of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} against the predictions of the renormalized BCS model, it is concluded that Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is a weak-coupled BCS superconductor with, presumably, an electron-phonon pairing mechanism. The characteristic (superconducting) parameters of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (see Table II) were evaluated based on the BCS-type relations, namely [12, 13, 14]

\[[\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}]_{T_{c}}=1.43,\quad 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.53,\quad \text{and}\]

\[T_{c}=(\theta_{D}/1.45)\exp[-(1+\lambda)/(\lambda-\mu^{*})],\] (2)

where 2\Delta_{0} is the superconductivity gap at zero temperature and \mu^{*} is the Coulomb pseudopotential, which, according to

(2)] are used for the calculation on Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, while their corresponding strong-coupling corrections [Eqs. (3)–(5)] are used for the calculation on Li_{2}Pd_{3}B. Standard deviations are included for the calculated quantities. Note that the pre-exponential factor in Eq. (2) is \theta_{D}/1.45 while that in Eq. (5) is \omega_{\rm ln}/1.2 (Ref. [13]). For Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, if instead of \theta_{D} we use \omega_{\rm ln}\approx\omega_{\rm ln}(Li_{2}Pd_{3}B) = 110 K, then \lambda is increased by 13% while N(E_{F}) is decreased by 4%. Thus, on a simple comparison, all conclusions reached in this work still hold.

  Chandara _et al._,[5] can be significant in these compounds (taken here to be 0.13).

The above quoted weak-coupling relations are found to be inadequate for the case of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B. Considering the structural and electronic isomorphism between these two compounds, the superconductivity of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is considered to be of the same character as that of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B--the assumption of phonon mediation is in line with the arguments Refs. [6] and [7]--but with a relatively stronger coupling constant. Indeed, its measured superconducting properties compare favorably with the following strong-coupling corrections (valid for T_{c}/\omega_{\rm log}\!\ll\!1):[12, 13, 14]

\[\left[\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\right]_{T_{c}}=1.43[1+53(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm log})^{2 }\ln(\omega_{\rm log}/3T_{c})],\] (3)

Recently superconductivity has been discovered in the antiperovskites Li_{2}Pd_{3}B (Ref. 1) and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (Refs. 2 and 3). These compounds crystallize [4] in the cubic space group P432, wherein the Pd/Pt atoms are arranged at the vertices of distorted octahedra that are centered by a B ion.

It is worth recalling that, due to the Li nonstoichiometry, there is some minor variation among the lattice parameters of different patches of the same compound, even when measured at the same temperature.

The position parameters of Li and Pt/Pd atoms that are not fixed by symmetry are very similar to those of Eibenstein and Jung[4] (see Table 1) and, in addition, they do not show any noticeable variation on going from 300 down to 2 K. Based on these and the above-mentioned findings, it is inferred that the basic room-temperature structural features remains unaltered. Specifically, the Li-Li distance is hardly modified on lowering the temperature; as a consequence the charge transfer to the T/B network, if solely governed by Li-Li distance, is unaffected by such temperature variations.

### Specific heat

The specific heat of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is shown in Fig. 2. Its normal state properties were achieved after quenching the superconductivity in a magnetic field of 70 kOe (>H_{c2}).[1] Under such a condition, the normal-state specific heat is adequately described by a superposition of a Sommerfeld (\gamma_T_) and Debye (\beta_T_^{3}) term: in a region of 2 K < T< 5 K, the normal-state coefficients are \gamma=9.0(1) mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta=1.08(1) mJ/mol K^{4}.

The zero-field specific heat of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is shown in Fig. 3. Its normal-state specific heat was analyzed as a sum of a linear and a cubic term; here also the analysis had been limited to the range T_{c} < T< 5 K. The fit is excellent, giving \gamma=7.0(1) mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta=0.98(1) mJ/mol K^{4}. Assuming no (drastic) modification in the normal-state properties due to the 70 kOe field, a comparison of \gamma and \beta of the two compounds (see Table 2) suggests that for the case of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, \gamma is almost 30% higher while the Debye temperature, \theta_{\rm D}, is only 3% lower; evidently only the difference between their \gamma is significant. Such an enhancement of \gamma could be due to an increase in the single-spin electron density of state at the Fermi level N(E_{F}) or in the electronic mass-enhancement parameter \lambda:

\[\gamma=\frac{2}{3}\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda)N(E_{F}).\] (1)

As \lambda appears also in expressions governing the superconducting properties of these compounds (see below), then it is possible to evaluate separately each of N(E_{F}) and \lambda; in an

For each panel, symbols represent the total measured diffraction intensity while the solid line gives the calculated pattern. The difference curve is shown at the bottom while the Bragg positions are indicated as short bars. Some refined parameters are given in Table 1. The reliability factors for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (having, relatively, better statistics) are R_{B}=5.5 and R_{F}=3.9.

  ticipation, the enhancement of \gamma is due mainly to an increase in \lambda (see below).

From the analysis of the specific heats at the onset of the superconducting state (Figs. 2 and 3) and utilizing the balance of entropy (see the inset of Fig. 3), we extracted the values of T_{c} and \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} (the specific-heat jump at T_{c}): T_{c} of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is 7.5(2) K while that of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is 2.17(5) K (both agree very well with the reported values [1, 3]). \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} is 2.0(3) for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B while 1.39(3) for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B: since for a standard BCS superconductor \Delta C/\gamma T_{c}=1.43, it is evident that Li_{2}Pt_{3}B agrees quite reasonably with the weakly-coupled BCS prediction, but Li_{2}Pd_{3}B deviates appreciably due to strong-coupling effects (see below). It is worth mentioning that for the particular case of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, the large errors in \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} and T_{c} are due to an almost-1 K-broadened-transition region, which, according to Togano _et al._, [1] is due to the nonstoichiometry of lithium. For this reason, we did not evaluate the thermal evolution of \Delta C(T)/\gamma T in the neighborhood of T_{c} nor its thermal derivative at T_{c}.

The analysis of the electronic specific heat within the superconducting phase C_{\rm es}(T) of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is shown in Fig. 4 while that of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B in Fig. 5. Evidently in both figures, C_{\rm es}(T) reflects clearly an exponential behavior, indicative of a gap character. For Li_{2}Pd_{3}B, the solid line represents C_{\rm es}(T)=22\gamma T_{c} exp(-2.17_{c}/_T_) J/mol K while for Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, C_{\rm es}(T)=8.5\gamma T_{c} exp(-1.42T_{c}/_T_) J/mol K. It is recalled that for a weak-coupled BCS superconductor, [10]C_{\rm es}(T) =8.5\gamma T_{c} exp(-1.44T_{c}/_T_) for 2.5<T_{c}/_T_<6, C_{\rm es}(T) =26\gamma T_{c} exp(-1.62T_{c}/_T_) for 7<T_{c}/_T_<12, and C_{\rm es}(T) =3.15\gamma T_{c}(T_{c}/_T_){  is considered to be due to strong-coupling corrections.

Finally, the ratio \theta_{D,{\rm P}_{\rm i}}\sqrt{M_{\rm Pl}}/(\theta_{D,{\rm pd}}\sqrt{M_{\rm pd}}) \approx 1.4 is 40% higher than expected. Similarly, the partial isotope relation T_{c,{\rm P}_{\rm i}}\sqrt{M_{\rm Pl}}/T_{c,{\rm pd}}\sqrt{M_{\rm pd}}\approx 0.4 is 60% away from the prediction of the standard BCS model. The difficulty in controlling the Li stoichiometry discouraged us from studying the isotope effect in these superconductors: it was reported earlier [1] that T_{c} strongly depends on the stoichiometry of the Li atom, reminiscent of the carbon nonstoichiometry in the similar antiperovskite MgCNi_{3}.[11] A similar Li dependence of T_{c} is expected to be present in the Li_{2}(Pt_{x}Pd_{1-x})_{3}B series,[2, 3] however, such a nonstoichiometry cannot account for the linear decrease of T_{c} with x.

## IV Discussion and Conclusion

According to the above-shown specific heats, the low-temperature normal-state electronic and thermal properties of the studied compounds can be described, respectively, within the Sommerfeld and Debye approximations. The range of \gamma indicates a conventional Fermi liquid behavior. Further, the bulk character of their superconductivities is clearly revealed and that the evolution of their specific heat within the superconducting phase is indicative of a thermal activation across a superconducting gap: for Li_{2}Pd_{3}B the conventional gapped superconductivity is in line with the findings of Nishiyama _et al.[7]_ On checking this exponential character and the ranges of \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} against the predictions of the renormalized BCS model, it is concluded that Li_{2}Pt_{3}B is a weak-coupled BCS superconductor with, presumably, an electron-phonon pairing mechanism. The characteristic (superconducting) parameters of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B (see Table II) were evaluated based on the BCS-type relations, namely [12, 13, 14]

\[[\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}]_{T_{c}}=1.43,\quad 2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.53,\quad \text{and}\]

\[T_{c}=(\theta_{D}/1.45)\exp[-(1+\lambda)/(\lambda-\mu^{*})],\] (2)

where 2\Delta_{0} is the superconductivity gap at zero temperature and \mu^{*} is the Coulomb pseudopotential, which, according to

Table 2: Normal and superconducting parameters of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B and Li_{2}Pt_{3}B. All terms have their usual definitions. (Renormalized) BCS relations [Eq. (2)] are used for the calculation on Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, while their corresponding strong-coupling corrections [Eqs. (3)–(5)] are used for the calculation on Li_{2}Pd_{3}B. Standard deviations are included for the calculated quantities. Note that the pre-exponential factor in Eq. (2) is \theta_{D}/1.45 while that in Eq. (5) is \omega_{\rm ln}/1.2 (Ref. [13]). For Li_{2}Pt_{3}B, if instead of \theta_{D} we use \omega_{\rm ln}\approx\omega_{\rm ln}(Li_{2}Pd_{3}B) = 110 K, then \lambda is increased by 13% while N(E_{F}) is decreased by 4%. Thus, on a simple comparison, all conclusions reached in this work still hold.

  Chandara _et al._,[5] can be significant in these compounds (taken here to be 0.13).

The above quoted weak-coupling relations are found to be inadequate for the case of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B. Considering the structural and electronic isomorphism between these two compounds, the superconductivity of Li_{2}Pd_{3}B is considered to be of the same character as that of Li_{2}Pt_{3}B--the assumption of phonon mediation is in line with the arguments Refs. [6] and [7]--but with a relatively stronger coupling constant. Indeed, its measured superconducting properties compare favorably with the following strong-coupling corrections (valid for T_{c}/\omega_{\rm log}\!\ll\!1):[12, 13, 14]

\[\left[\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\right]_{T_{c}}=1.43[1+53(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm log})^{2 }\ln(\omega_{\rm log}/3T_{c})],\] (3)

\[2\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.53[1+12.5(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm log})^{2}\ln(\omega_{\rm log }/2T_{c})],\] (4)  7] M. Nishiyama, Y. Inada, and G. Q. Zheng, Phys. Rev. B **71**, 220505(R) (2005).
