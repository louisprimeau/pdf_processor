###### Abstract

The in-plane thermal conductivity \(\kappa\) of the iron selenide superconductor FeSe\({}_{x}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 8.8 K) was measured down to 120 mK and up to 14.5 T (=3/4\(H_{c_{2}}\)). In zero field, the residual linear term \(\kappa_{0}/T\) at \(T\)\(\rightarrow\) 0 is only about 16 \(\mu\)W K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\), less than 4% of its normal-state value. Such a small \(\kappa_{0}/T\) does not support the existence of nodes in the superconducting gap. More importantly, the field dependence of \(\kappa_{0}/T\) in FeSe\({}_{x}\) is very similar to that in NbSe\({}_{2}\), a typical multigap \(s\)-wave superconductor. We consider our data as strong evidence for multigap nodeless (at least in \(ab\) plane) superconductivity in FeSe\({}_{x}\). This kind of superconducting gap structure may be generic for all Fe-based superconductors.

## I Introduction

Just as CuO plane is the basic building block of high-\(T_{c}\) cuprate superconductors, FeAs layer is the basic structure of the newly discovered FeAs-based high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] The FeAs-layer consists of a Fe square planar sheet tetrahedrally coordinated by As. However, unlike the rigid CuO plane in cuprates, partial substitution of Fe by Co or Ni, or As by P within the FeAs-layer can effectively induce superconductivity.[8, 9, 10, 11, 12] In this sense, the discovery of superconductivity in binary FeSe\({}_{x}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 8 K) is of great interests since it only contains the superconducting FeSe layer which has identical structure as FeAs layer, and the Se deficiency may cause the superconductivity.[13] More remarkably, the onset \(T_{c}\) can be enhanced to as high as 37 K for FeSe\({}_{x}\) under high pressure,[14, 15, 16] which further implies that superconductivity in FeSe\({}_{x}\) may have the same mechanism as in FeAs-based superconductors.

For this new family of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors, the pairing symmetry of its superconducting gap is a key to understand the mechanism of superconductivity. Extensive experimental and theoretical work have been done to address this important issue for FeAs-based superconductors (for a theoretical review, see Ref. [17]; for an experimental review, see Ref. [18]). Although there is still no consensus, more and more evidences point to multigap nodeless superconductivity, possibly an unconventional \(s^{\pm}\) paring mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations.[19] For the prototype FeSe\({}_{x}\) superconductor, however, there were very few experiments to study the superconducting gap structure. This is due to its relatively lower \(T_{c}\) and lack of sizable high-quality single crystals.[20, 21] The measurements of in-plane magnetic penetration depth for polycrystal FeSe\({}_{0.85}\) are in favor of anisotropic \(s\)-wave superconducting gap or two gaps (\(s\) + \(s\)).[22] To clarify this important issue, more experimental work are needed for FeSe\({}_{x}\) superconductor.

Low-temperature thermal-conductivity measurement is a powerful tool to study the superconducting gap structure.[23] The field dependence of the residual thermal conductivity \(\kappa_{0}/T\) for BaNi\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 0.7 K) is consistent with a dirty fully gapped superconductivity.[24] For Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 30 K) and BaFe\({}_{1.9}\)Ni\({}_{0.1}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 20.3 K), a negligible \(\kappa_{0}/T\) was found in zero field, indicating a full superconducting gap.[25, 26] However, \(\kappa(T)\) was only measured in magnetic fields up to \(\sim\)\(H_{c_{2}}\)/4 (\(H\)=15 T), thus, cannot show clearly whether the superconductivity has multigap character in FeAs-based superconductors.[25, 26]

In this paper, we measure the in-plane thermal conductivity \(\kappa\) of a FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystal with \(T_{c}\) = 8.8 K down to 120 mK and up to 14.5 T (\(\approx\)3/4\(H_{c_{2}}\)) to probe its superconducting gap structure. In zero field, \(\kappa_{0}/T\) is about 16 \(\mu\)W K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\), less than 4% of its normal-state value. Such a small \(\kappa_{0}/T\) should not come from the nodal quasiparticle contribution. It may simply result from the slight overestimation when doing extrapolation, due to the lack of lower temperature data. The field dependence of \(\kappa_{0}/T\) is very similar to that in multigap \(s\)-wave superconductor NbSe\({}_{2}\). Based on our data, it is evident that FeSe\({}_{x}\) is a multigap nodeless (at least in \(ab\) plane) superconductor.

## II Experiment

FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystals with nominal formula FeSe\({}_{0.82}\) were grown via a vapor self-transport method.[21] The \(ab\)-plane dimensions of as-grown crystals ranges from a few hundred \(\mu\)m to 1 mm. Energy dispersive of x-ray (EDX) microanalysis (Hitachi S-4800) show that the actual Fe:Se ratio is very close to 1:1 in our FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystals. The nominal formula FeSe\({}_{0.82}\) was used in the initial work by Hsu _et al.[13]_ However, the actual superconducting phase was later determined to be FeSe\({}_{0.99\pm 0.02}\) in Ref. [27] and FeSe\({}_{0.974\pm 0.055}\) in Ref. [28]. Therefore the EDX result of our FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystals is consistent with these two later reports.

The ac susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) with a modulation field of 10 Oe at 10 kHz. An as-grown single crystal with dimensions 1.0\(\times\)0.40 mm\({}^{2}\) in the plane and 190 \(\mu\)m thickness along the \(c\) axis was selected for transport study. Contacts were made directly on the sample surfaces with silver paint, which were used for both resistivity and thermal-conductivity measurements. The resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe method, using a low frequency ac resistance bridge (Lakeshore 370) with an excitation current \(I\) = 1 mA. The typical contact resistance is a few ohms at room temperature and 1.5 K, which is not as good as that on Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and BaFe\({}_{1.9}\)Ni\({}_{0.1}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals.[25; 26] In-plane thermal conductivity was measured in a dilution refrigerator using a standard one-heater-two-thermometer steady-state technique.[29] Due to the small size of the sample and the nonideal contacts, good thermalization between sample and the two RuO\({}_{2}\) thermometers can only be achieved down to 120 mK. Magnetic fields were applied along the \(c\) axis and perpendicular to the heat current. To ensure a homogeneous field distribution in the sample, all fields were applied at temperature above _T\({}_{c}\)_.

## III Results and discussion

Figure 1(a) shows the in-plane resistivity of FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystal in \(H\) = 0 and 14.5 T magnetic fields. The middle point of the resistive transition is at _T\({}_{c}\)_ = 8.8 K in zero field. The 10%-90% transition width of our crystal is as broad as the powder sample,[13] which has been noticed in Ref. 21. Above _T\({}_{c}\)_, _p_(_T_) manifests a very good linear dependence up to 80 K, similar to the powder sample.[13] A linear fit of _p_(_T_) gives the residual resistivity \(r\)0 = 57.9 \(\mu\Omega\) cm in \(H\) = 14.5 T, which is about 1/4 the value of powder sample.[13]

To estimate the upper critical field _H\({}_{c_{2}}\)_(0) which completely suppresses the resistive transition, we define _T\({}_{c}\)_(onset) at the temperature where _p_(_T_) deviates from the linear dependence, and get _T\({}_{c}\)_(onset) = 11.9 and 6.3 K for \(H\) = 0 and 14.5 T, respectively. Using the relationship _H\({}_{c_{2}}\)_/_H\({}_{c_{2}}\)_(0) = 1\(-\)[_T_/_T\({}_{c}\)_(0)]\({}^{2}\), we get _H\({}_{c_{2}}\)_(0) = 20.1 T. Note that _H\({}_{c_{2}}\)_(0) = 16.3 T was estimated for the powder sample, in which _T\({}_{c}\)_ was defined at the middle point of the transition.[13]

In Fig. 1(b), the real part of ac susceptibility for FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystal is plotted. The positive ferromagnetic background has been attributed to the existence of Fe impurity in the FeSe\({}_{x}\) powder sample.[13] However, no iron, iron oxide, or iron silicide impurities were detected in our crystals;[21] therefore the ferromagnetic background likely results from the magnetic Fe cluster promoted by Se vacancies.[30]

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane thermal conductivity for FeSe\({}_{x}\) in zero field. To extrapolate the residual linear term _k\({}_{0}\)/T_, we fit the data to _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ = \(a\) + _bT\({}^{\alpha-1}\),[29; 31] where _a_T and _bT\({}^{\alpha}\)_ represent electronic and phonon contributions, respectively. In Fig. 2, the data from 120 mK to 0.7 K can be fitted (the solid line) and gives _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ = 16 \(\pm\) 2 \(\mu\)W K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\), with \(a\) = 2.47.

Such a value of _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ is slightly larger than the experimental error bar \(\pm\) 5 \(\mu\)W K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\).[31] However, it is still fairly small, less than 4% of the normal-state Wiedemann-Franz law expectation _k\({}_{\rm{N0}}\)/T_ = _L\({}_{0}\)/_r_0 = 0.423 mW K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\), with \(L\)0 = 2.45 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-8}\) W \(\Omega\) K\({}^{-2}\) and \(r\)0 = 57.9 \(\mu\Omega\) cm. For unconventional superconductors with nodes in the superconducting gap, a substantial _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ in zero field contributed by the nodal quasiparticles has been found.[32; 33] For example, for overdoped _d_-wave cuprate superconductor T12201 with _T\({}_{c}\)_ = 15 K, _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ = 1.41 mW K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\), about 36% _k\({}_{\rm{N0}}\)/T_.[32] For _p_-wave superconductor Sr\({}_{2}\)RuO\({}_{4}\) with _T\({}_{c}\)_ = 1.5 K, _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ = 17 mW K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\), more than 9% _k\({}_{\rm{N0}}\)/T_ for the best sample.[35] We also note that _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ in zero field are all negligible in closely related superconductors BaNi\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), and BaFe\({}_{1.9}\)Ni\({}_{0.1}\)As\({}_{2}\).[24; 25; 26] Therefore, it is unlikely that _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ = 16 \(\pm\) 2 \(\mu\)W K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\) in FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystal comes from the nodal quasiparticle contribution. Since no impurity phases were detected, such a small _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ may simply result from the slight overestimation when doing extrapolation, due to the lack of experimental data below 120 mK.

Below we turn to the field dependence of _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ in FeSe\({}_{x}\). Figure 3 shows the low-temperature thermal conductivity of FeSe\({}_{x}\) in magnetic fields applied along the \(c\) axis (_H_ = 0, 1, 4,

The solid line is a linear fit of _ρ_(_T_) from 8 to 30 K, which gives the residual resistivity _ρ_0 = 57.9 \(\mu\Omega\) cm in \(H\) = 14.5 T. (b) The real part of ac susceptibility.

The solid line represents a fit of the data to _ω_/_T_ = \(a\) + _bT\({}^{\alpha-1}\). This gives the residual linear term _k\({}_{0}\)/T_ = 16 \(\pm\) 2 \(\mu\)W K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\).

  9, and 14.5 T). For \(H\)= 1 T, the data is also fitted to \(\kappa/T\)=\(a\)+\(bT^{\alpha-1}\), and gives \(\kappa_{0}/T\)=\(4\pm 2\)\(\mu\)W K\({}^{-2}\) cm\({}^{-1}\), with \(\alpha\)=2.47. For \(H\)= 4, 9, and 14.5 T, the electronic contribution becomes more and more dominant and the data get less smooth, therefore \(\alpha\) is fixed to 2.47 in the phonon term \(bT^{\alpha}\). From Fig. 3, even higher magnetic field is needed to increase \(\kappa/T\) to its normal-state value.

In Fig. 4, we put the normalized \(\kappa_{0}/T(H)\) of FeSe\({}_{x}\) together with the clean \(s\)-wave superconductor Nb [34], the dirty \(s\)-wave superconducting alloy InBi [35], the multiband \(s\)-wave superconductor NbSe\({}_{2}\)[36], and an overdoped sample of the \(d\)-wave superconductor Tl-2201 [32], plotted as a function of \(H/H_{c_{2}}\). For a clean (like Nb) or dirty (like InBi) type-II \(s\)-wave superconductor with isotropic gap, \(\kappa_{0}/T\) should grow exponentially with field (above \(H_{c_{2}}\)). This usually gives negligible \(\kappa_{0}/T\) for field lower than \(H_{c_{2}}/4\). For the \(d\)-wave superconductor Tl-2201, \(\kappa_{0}/T\) increases roughly proportional to \(\sqrt{H}\) at low field due to the Volovik effect [37]. By contrast, for multigap superconductors NbSe\({}_{2}\) and MgB\({}_{2}\)[38, 36], magnetic field will first suppress the superconductivity on the Fermi surface with smaller gap, and give distinct shape of \(\kappa_{0}/T(H)\) curve, as seen in Fig. 4.

From Fig. 4, the \(\kappa_{0}/T(H)\) of FeSe\({}_{x}\) manifests almost identical behavior as that of multigap \(s\)-wave superconductor NbSe\({}_{2}\). For NbSe\({}_{2}\), the shape of \(\kappa_{0}/T(H)\) has been quantitatively explained by multiband superconductivity, whereby the gap on the \(\Gamma\) band is approximately one third of the gap on the other two Fermi surfaces [36]. Therefore, we consider our data as strong evidence for multigap nodeless superconductivity in FeSe\({}_{x}\), with the ratio of the large gap to small gap close to 3. Note that in the two-gap \(s\)+\(s\)-wave model to describe the in-plane penetration depth data, the magnitude of the two gaps are 1.60 and 0.38 meV, respectively [22]. The ratio of these two gaps is about 4, in agreement with the value estimated from our thermal-conductivity results. Since point nodes along \(c\) axis do not contribute to in-plane transport, measurement along \(c\) axis has to be done to rule out this possibility in FeSe\({}_{x}\).

So far, there is still no experiment to directly measure the superconducting gap in Fe\({}_{1+y}\)Te\({}_{1-x}\)Se\({}_{x}\) system. Density functional calculations show that the electronic band structure of FeS, FeSe, and FeTe are very similar to the FeAs-based superconductors [39]. In doped BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), multigap nodeless superconductivity has been clearly demonstrated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments [40, 41, 42]. For hole-doped Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\)=37 K), the average gap values \(\Delta(0)\) for the two hole pockets (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)) are 12.5 and 5.5 meV, respectively, while for the electron (\(\gamma\) and \(\delta\)) pockets, the gap value is similar, about 12.5 meV [40, 41]. For electron-doped BaFe\({}_{1.85}\)Co\({}_{0.15}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\)=25.5 K), the average gap values \(\Delta(0)\) of hole (\(\beta\)) and electron (\(\nu\) and \(\delta\)) pockets are 6.6 and 5.0 meV, respectively [42]. The ratio of the large gap to small gap is 2.3 for Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). This may explain the linear increase of \(\kappa_{0}/T(H)\) at low field in Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), with a smaller slope than that in NbSe\({}_{2}\)[25]. However, magnetic field was only applied up to \(H_{c_{2}}/4\) for Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and the multigap character of \(\kappa_{0}/T(\dot{H})\) was not as clear as in NbSe\({}_{2}\) and our FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystal.

## IV Summary

In summary, we have measured the low-temperature thermal conductivity of iron selenide superconductor FeSe\({}_{x}\) to investigate its superconducting gap structure. A fairly small \(\kappa_{0}/T\) at zero field and the dramatic field dependence of \(\kappa_{0}/T\) give strong evidence for multigap nodeless (at least in \(ab\) plane) superconductivity in FeSe\({}_{x}\). Such a gap structure may be generic for all Fe-based superconductors. More experiments are needed to distinguish unconventional \(s^{\pm}\) wave

[36]), and an overdoped sample of the \(d\)-wave superconductor Tl-2201 (Ref. [32]) are also shown for comparison.

The solid lines are \(\kappa/T\)=\(a\)+\(bT^{\alpha-1}\) fits. For \(H\)=4, 9, and 14.5 T, the electronic contribution becomes more and more dominant and the data get less smooth, therefore \(\alpha\) is fixed to 2.47. The dashed line is the normal-state Wiedemann-Franz law expectation at \(T\)\(\rightarrow\)0, namely, \(L_{0}/\rho_{0}\) with \(L_{0}\) the Lorenz number 2.45\(\times\)10\({}^{-8}\) W J K\({}^{-2}\).
