## I Introduction

Just as CuO plane is the basic building block of high-T_(c) cuprate
superconductors, FeAs layer is the basic structure of the newly
discovered FeAs-based high-T_(c) superconductors.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
The FeAs-layer consists of a Fe square planar sheet tetrahedrally
coordinated by As. However, unlike the rigid CuO plane in cuprates,
partial substitution of Fe by Co or Ni, or As by P within the FeAs-layer
can effectively induce superconductivity.[8, 9, 10, 11, 12] In this
sense, the discovery of superconductivity in binary FeSe_(x) (T_(c) = 8
K) is of great interests since it only contains the superconducting FeSe
layer which has identical structure as FeAs layer, and the Se deficiency
may cause the superconductivity.[13] More remarkably, the onset T_(c)
can be enhanced to as high as 37 K for FeSe_(x) under high pressure,[14,
15, 16] which further implies that superconductivity in FeSe_(x) may
have the same mechanism as in FeAs-based superconductors.

For this new family of high-T_(c) superconductors, the pairing symmetry
of its superconducting gap is a key to understand the mechanism of
superconductivity. Extensive experimental and theoretical work have been
done to address this important issue for FeAs-based superconductors (for
a theoretical review, see Ref. [17]; for an experimental review, see
Ref. [18]). Although there is still no consensus, more and more
evidences point to multigap nodeless superconductivity, possibly an
unconventional s^(±) paring mediated by antiferromagnetic
fluctuations.[19] For the prototype FeSe_(x) superconductor, however,
there were very few experiments to study the superconducting gap
structure. This is due to its relatively lower T_(c) and lack of sizable
high-quality single crystals.[20, 21] The measurements of in-plane
magnetic penetration depth for polycrystal FeSe_(0.85) are in favor of
anisotropic s-wave superconducting gap or two gaps (s + s).[22] To
clarify this important issue, more experimental work are needed for
FeSe_(x) superconductor.

Low-temperature thermal-conductivity measurement is a powerful tool to
study the superconducting gap structure.[23] The field dependence of the
residual thermal conductivity κ₀/T for BaNi₂As₂ (T_(c) = 0.7 K) is
consistent with a dirty fully gapped superconductivity.[24] For
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (T_(c) = 30 K) and BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂ (T_(c) =
20.3 K), a negligible κ₀/T was found in zero field, indicating a full
superconducting gap.[25, 26] However, κ(T) was only measured in magnetic
fields up to ∼H_(c₂)/4 (H=15 T), thus, cannot show clearly whether the
superconductivity has multigap character in FeAs-based
superconductors.[25, 26]

In this paper, we measure the in-plane thermal conductivity κ of a
FeSe_(x) single crystal with T_(c) = 8.8 K down to 120 mK and up to 14.5
T (≈3/4H_(c₂)) to probe its superconducting gap structure. In zero
field, κ₀/T is about 16 μW K⁻² cm⁻¹, less than 4

## II Experiment

FeSe_(x) single crystals with nominal formula FeSe_(0.82) were grown via
a vapor self-transport method.[21] The ab-plane dimensions of as-grown
crystals ranges from a few hundred μm to 1 mm. Energy dispersive of
x-ray (EDX) microanalysis (Hitachi S-4800) show that the actual Fe:Se
ratio is very close to 1:1 in our FeSe_(x) single crystals. The nominal
formula FeSe_(0.82) was used in the initial work by Hsu _et al.[13]_
However, the actual superconducting phase was later determined to be
FeSe_(0.99 ± 0.02) in Ref. [27] and FeSe_(0.974 ± 0.055) in Ref. [28].
Therefore the EDX result of our FeSe_(x) single crystals is consistent
with these two later reports.

The ac susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design Physical Property
Measurement System (PPMS) with a modulation field of 10 Oe at 10 kHz. An
as-grown single crystal with dimensions 1.0×0.40 mm² in the plane and
190 μm thickness along the c axis was selected for transport study.
Contacts were made directly on the sample surfaces with silver paint,
which were used for both resistivity and thermal-conductivity
measurements. The resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe
method, using a low frequency ac resistance bridge (Lakeshore 370) with
an excitation current I = 1 mA. The typical contact resistance is a few
ohms at room temperature and 1.5 K, which is not as good as that on
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂ single crystals.[25; 26]
In-plane thermal conductivity was measured in a dilution refrigerator
using a standard one-heater-two-thermometer steady-state technique.[29]
Due to the small size of the sample and the nonideal contacts, good
thermalization between sample and the two RuO₂ thermometers can only be
achieved down to 120 mK. Magnetic fields were applied along the c axis
and perpendicular to the heat current. To ensure a homogeneous field
distribution in the sample, all fields were applied at temperature above
_T_(c)_.

## III Results and discussion

Figure 1(a) shows the in-plane resistivity of FeSe_(x) single crystal in
H = 0 and 14.5 T magnetic fields. The middle point of the resistive
transition is at _T_(c)_ = 8.8 K in zero field. The 10

To estimate the upper critical field _H_(c₂)_(0) which completely
suppresses the resistive transition, we define _T_(c)_(onset) at the
temperature where _p_(_T_) deviates from the linear dependence, and get
_T_(c)_(onset) = 11.9 and 6.3 K for H = 0 and 14.5 T, respectively.
Using the relationship _H_(c₂)_/_H_(c₂)_(0) = 1−[_T_/_T_(c)_(0)]², we
get _H_(c₂)_(0) = 20.1 T. Note that _H_(c₂)_(0) = 16.3 T was estimated
for the powder sample, in which _T_(c)_ was defined at the middle point
of the transition.[13]

In Fig. 1(b), the real part of ac susceptibility for FeSe_(x) single
crystal is plotted. The positive ferromagnetic background has been
attributed to the existence of Fe impurity in the FeSe_(x) powder
sample.[13] However, no iron, iron oxide, or iron silicide impurities
were detected in our crystals;[21] therefore the ferromagnetic
background likely results from the magnetic Fe cluster promoted by Se
vacancies.[30]

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane thermal
conductivity for FeSe_(x) in zero field. To extrapolate the residual
linear term _k₀/T_, we fit the data to _k₀/T_ = a + _bT^(α − 1),[29; 31]
where _a_T and _bT^(α)_ represent electronic and phonon contributions,
respectively. In Fig. 2, the data from 120 mK to 0.7 K can be fitted
(the solid line) and gives _k₀/T_ = 16 ± 2 μW K⁻² cm⁻¹, with a = 2.47.

Such a value of _k₀/T_ is slightly larger than the experimental error
bar ± 5 μW K⁻² cm⁻¹.[31] However, it is still fairly small, less than 4

Below we turn to the field dependence of _k₀/T_ in FeSe_(x). Figure 3
shows the low-temperature thermal conductivity of FeSe_(x) in magnetic
fields applied along the c axis (_H_ = 0, 1, 4,

single crystal in H = 0 and 14.5 T magnetic fields along the c axis. The
solid line is a linear fit of _ρ_(_T_) from 8 to 30 K, which gives the
residual resistivity _ρ_0 = 57.9 μΩ cm in H = 14.5 T. (b) The real part

9, and 14.5 T). For H= 1 T, the data is also fitted to κ/T=a+bT^(α − 1),
and gives κ₀/T=4 ± 2μW K⁻² cm⁻¹, with α=2.47. For H= 4, 9, and 14.5 T,
the electronic contribution becomes more and more dominant and the data
get less smooth, therefore α is fixed to 2.47 in the phonon term bT^(α).
From Fig. 3, even higher magnetic field is needed to increase κ/T to its
normal-state value.

In Fig. 4, we put the normalized κ₀/T(H) of FeSe_(x) together with the
clean s-wave superconductor Nb [34], the dirty s-wave superconducting
alloy InBi [35], the multiband s-wave superconductor NbSe₂[36], and an
overdoped sample of the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201 [32], plotted as a
function of H/H_(c₂). For a clean (like Nb) or dirty (like InBi) type-II
s-wave superconductor with isotropic gap, κ₀/T should grow exponentially
with field (above H_(c₂)). This usually gives negligible κ₀/T for field
lower than H_(c₂)/4. For the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201, κ₀/T
increases roughly proportional to $\sqrt{H}$ at low field due to the
Volovik effect [37]. By contrast, for multigap superconductors NbSe₂ and
MgB₂[38, 36], magnetic field will first suppress the superconductivity
on the Fermi surface with smaller gap, and give distinct shape of
κ₀/T(H) curve, as seen in Fig. 4.

From Fig. 4, the κ₀/T(H) of FeSe_(x) manifests almost identical behavior
as that of multigap s-wave superconductor NbSe₂. For NbSe₂, the shape of
κ₀/T(H) has been quantitatively explained by multiband
superconductivity, whereby the gap on the Γ band is approximately one
third of the gap on the other two Fermi surfaces [36]. Therefore, we
consider our data as strong evidence for multigap nodeless
superconductivity in FeSe_(x), with the ratio of the large gap to small
gap close to 3. Note that in the two-gap s+s-wave model to describe the
in-plane penetration depth data, the magnitude of the two gaps are 1.60
and 0.38 meV, respectively [22]. The ratio of these two gaps is about 4,
in agreement with the value estimated from our thermal-conductivity
results. Since point nodes along c axis do not contribute to in-plane
transport, measurement along c axis has to be done to rule out this
possibility in FeSe_(x).

So far, there is still no experiment to directly measure the
superconducting gap in Fe_(1 + y)Te_(1 − x)Se_(x) system. Density
functional calculations show that the electronic band structure of FeS,
FeSe, and FeTe are very similar to the FeAs-based superconductors [39].
In doped BaFe₂As₂, multigap nodeless superconductivity has been clearly
demonstrated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
experiments [40, 41, 42]. For hole-doped Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂ (T_(c)=37
K), the average gap values Δ(0) for the two hole pockets (α and β) are
12.5 and 5.5 meV, respectively, while for the electron (γ and δ)
pockets, the gap value is similar, about 12.5 meV [40, 41]. For
electron-doped BaFe_(1.85)Co_(0.15)As₂ (T_(c)=25.5 K), the average gap
values Δ(0) of hole (β) and electron (ν and δ) pockets are 6.6 and 5.0
meV, respectively [42]. The ratio of the large gap to small gap is 2.3
for Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂. This may explain the linear increase of
κ₀/T(H) at low field in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂, with a smaller slope than
that in NbSe₂[25]. However, magnetic field was only applied up to
H_(c₂)/4 for Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and the multigap character of κ₀/T(Ḣ)
was not as clear as in NbSe₂ and our FeSe_(x) single crystal.

## IV Summary

In summary, we have measured the low-temperature thermal conductivity of
iron selenide superconductor FeSe_(x) to investigate its superconducting
gap structure. A fairly small κ₀/T at zero field and the dramatic field
dependence of κ₀/T give strong evidence for multigap nodeless (at least
in ab plane) superconductivity in FeSe_(x). Such a gap structure may be
generic for all Fe-based superconductors. More experiments are needed to
distinguish unconventional s^(±) wave

[36]), and an overdoped sample of the d-wave superconductor Tl-2201
(Ref. [32]) are also shown for comparison.

T, the electronic contribution becomes more and more dominant and the
data get less smooth, therefore α is fixed to 2.47. The dashed line is
