###### Abstract

The effect of pressure on the structural properties of lanthanum sesquicarbide La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) (\(T_{c}\)=13 K) has been investigated at room temperature by angle-dispersive powder x-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell. The compound remains in the cubic Pu\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\)-type structure at pressures up to at least 30 GPa. The corresponding equation of state parameters are reported and discussed in terms of phase stability of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\). Pressure-volume data of the impurity phase LaC\({}_{2}\) are reported also for pressures up to 13 GPa.

## 1 Introduction

Superconductivity in binary rare-earth carbides has been an intensively investigated topic for many years. Outstanding in this family of compounds with respect to their superconducting transition temperatures \(T_{c}\) are the sesquicarbides RE\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\), RE being the nonmagnetic rare-earth metals Y and La. These systems recently regained attention due to the finding by Amano _et al._ and Nakane _et al._ who reported the successful synthesis of binary Y\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) under high-pressure conditions (\(\sim\)5 GPa). They reported transition temperatures \(T_{c}\) and critical fields \(B_{c2}\) of 18 K and \(>\)30 T, respectively.[1, 2]

All RE carbides of composition RE\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) are isotypic; they crystallize in the cubic Pu\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) structure-type[3] (see Fig. 1). Electronic structure calculations, based on the Pu\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) structure type, have been carried out recently for Y\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) by Shein _et al._ and by Singh and Mazin.[4, 5] Singh and Mazin[5] specifically discuss the origin and magnitude of the electron-phonon coupling in Y\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\). They identify low-frequency metal atom vibrations to have the largest coupling whereas the contribution of the high-frequency C-C stretching vibrations is found to be comparatively small.

So far, the samples of Y\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) showing a \(T_{c}\) of 18 K have been characterized by x-ray powder diffraction only. A more detailed investigation of these phases with respect to the exact composition and the phase diagram is still pending. In this respect La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\), which shows superconductivity with \(T_{c}\) up to 13.2 K and which can be prepared at ambient pressure, is better understood.[6, 7, 8]

We report here the equation of state and the effect of pressure on the structure of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\). The structural properties were measured up to 30 GPa using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction in the angle-dispersive mode. Our primary motivation was to investigate how pressure affects the structural degrees of freedom of the Pu\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\)-type phase; these are thought to play a key role in controlling the details of the electronic structure in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Second, the equation of state and phase stability of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) is of interest in the context of pressure synthesis of rare-earth carbides. To our knowledge, pressure-dependent studies similar to the ones presented here have not been reported so far for any of the known rare-earth and actinide sesquicarbides.

## 2 Sample characterization and diffraction experiments

The superconducting properties of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) depend sensitively on the carbon content. Spedding _et al._ and Gschneidner _et al._ report a homogeneity regime for La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3-x}\), which ranges from La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2.81}\) to La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3.01}\) with cubic lattice parameters ranging from 8.803 A to 8.818 A.[6, 7] Recently, Simon and Gulden reinvestigated the phase diagram of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3-x}\) (\((0{<}x{<}0.33)\)).[8] They find that the boundary phases with \(x\)=0 and \(x\)=0.33 are homogeneous but that by sufficiently extended annealing, samples within the homogeneity range tend to phase separate into the boundary phases with \(x\)=0 and \(x\)=0.33. According to magnetic susceptibility measurements[9] these boundary phases have sharp superconducting transitions at 5.6 K for \(x\)=0.33 and at 13.2 K for \(x\)=0. The latter value obtained for the stoichiometric phase La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) is appreciably increased over the early \(T_{c}\) of 11 K reported by Giorgi _et al.[10, 11]_ The 13.2 K phase shows critical fields \(B_{c2}\)\(\geq\)17 T, significantly enhanced over \(B_{c2}\)=12 T found by Francavilla _et al.[12]_ (see also Ref. 13).

The polycrystalline sample of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) used in the present study was prepared by arc melting appropriate quantities of La metal (Alfa, 99.99%) and graphite chips (Deutsche Carbone, 99.99%) with a slight excess (2\(-\)3 at. %) of graphite. The graphite chips had been heated (1050 \({}^{\circ}\)C) and degassed

 in vacuum (10\({}^{-5}\) mbar) for 1 day and then stored in a dried argon atmosphere. The sample pellets were annealed at 650 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 3 days and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C/h. All subsequent sample manipulations, including preparations for pressure experiments, were done in dry argon atmosphere.

The phase composition was checked by laboratory-based powder x-ray diffraction measurements using Cu \(K\alpha_{1}\) radiation; these showed La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) as the majority phase (\(\sim\)85 %) with a lattice parameter of 8.8150(6) A. Weak additional reflections were observed that are attributed to an impurity phase of tetragonal LaC\({}_{2}\) [\(a\)=3.9323(6) A, \(c\)=6.574(1) A], its overall fraction being less than \(\sim\)15%. The superconducting properties of the sample were determined by resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. The resistive transition (midpoint) and the onset of diamagnetic shielding occurs at \(T_{c}^{\mathrm{onset}}\)=13.5(1) K (see Fig. 2). The width of the resistive transition (10%-90% criterion) amounts to 0.1 K. The heat capacity proves bulk superconductivity with a characteristic anomaly at \(T_{c}\) of \(\Delta C_{p}/(\gamma T_{c})\)\(\approx\) 2.2; the deviation from the standard BCS anomaly is most likely due to enhanced electron-phonon coupling.

For the synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements the sample was ground to a fine powder and a small amount of the powder was transferred into the gasket of a diamond anvil cell (DAC). Nitrogen was used as a pressure medium. When nitrogen solidifies (2.5 GPa at 300 K), it causes some additional Bragg reflections (typically weak) due to its various high-pressure phases. Angle-dispersive powder x-ray diffraction patterns (wavelength \(\lambda\) = 0.4176 A) were measured at the beamline ID9 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, using image plate detection. The images were integrated using the program fit2d to yield intensity versus 2\(\theta\) diagrams.[15] To improve powder averaging, the DAC was oscillated by \(\pm\)3\({}^{\circ}\). The ruby luminescence method was used for pressure measurement.[16, 17]

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 3 shows representative diffraction diagrams of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) collected at 5 and 15 GPa. The cubic phase of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) was observed up to the highest pressure of this study, 30.7 GPa, and after releasing pressure. Extra Bragg reflections seen in the diffraction diagrams are consistent with the presence of tetragonal LaC\({}_{2}\) (SG \(I4/mmm\), No. 139, \(Z\)=4). The reflections due to LaC\({}_{2}\) gradually disappeared in the pressure range 10-13 GPa. Upon releasing pressure, the tetragonal phase was clearly present again at ambient conditions.

The diffraction patterns were analyzed by the Rietveld method using the program GSAS.[18, 19] The refined parameters of the sesapicarbide phase (space group \(I\bar{4}3d\)) were the lattice constant, the fractional coordinate (\(x,x,x\)) of the 16\(c\) (La) site, a common isotropic thermal parameter for all atom sites, a Chebyshev polynomial background, pseudo-Voigt profile function parameter, and an overall intensity scaling factor. The refinements were not sensitive to the exact value of the positional parameter \(v\), 0, 0.25 of the carbon 24\(d\) site. Hence, \(v\) was fixed at 0.3049 (Ref. [3]), corresponding to a C-C distance of 1.236 A at ambient, and assumed independent of pressure. A preferred orientation correction was applied, but was found to result in only minor improvements of the refinements. Two-phase refinements were performed in order to account for the admixture of tetragonal LaC\({}_{2}\), but only the unit cell parameters were refined for this phase; its internal parameter for the carbon position was assumed constant (\(z\)=0.4024,[14] corresponding to a C-C distance of 1.284 A at ambient). Figure 3 illustrates the results of the refinements for the two patterns collected at 5.0 and 15.0 GPa. The convergence was achieved at residuals (with a subtracted background) \(R_{wp}\)=8.7% for 5 GPa and at \(R_{wp}\)=8.2% for 15 GPa.

The experimental pressure-volume data of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) are shown in Fig. 4. At 30 GPa, La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) is compressed by 18%

The diffraction patterns were refined assuming an admixture of a tetragonal LaC\({}_{2}\) phase (Ref. [14]). Vertical markers indicate Bragg reflections of the two phases.

  and the volume is comparable to that of Y2C3 at ambient conditions. The pressure-volume data were fitted by a Birch equation of state[20]

\[P(x) = \frac{3}{2}B_{0}[x^{-7} - x^{-5}]\left[ 1 - \frac{3}{4}(B_{0}^{\prime} - 4)(1 - x^{-2}) \right],\]

where \(x\) = (_V_/_V_0)1/3 is a reduced length. The parameters are the volume \(V\)0, the bulk modulus \(B\)0, and its pressure derivative \(B\)0, all at zero pressure. The fitted parameters and their standard deviations are given in Table 1. The obtained value for \(V\)0 is consistent with literature data.[3, 8]

Among the sesquicarbide compounds with the cubic Pu2C3-type structure, La2C3 has the largest lattice parameter and therefore is expected to represent the most compressible candidate in this family of compounds. There appears to be no experimental data available on the bulk moduli of other cubic rare-earth sesquicarbides to compare with. The bulk modulus of La2C3 at 30 GPa is about 250 GPa. This value would be an upper limit for the ambient-pressure bulk modulus \(B\)0 of Y2C3; it is much lower than the calculated one (_B_0 = 363 GPa) reported in Ref. 4.

At ambient conditions, the volume per La2C3 formula unit (85.68 A3) is smaller than that of the constituents La metal and carbon in the diamond modification (La metal 37.5 A3/La, diamond 5.67 A3/C, 2 x 37.5 + 3 x 5.67 = 92.0 A3). So, the _P_D_V term in the free-energy difference favors the formation of the compound under pressure. However, because of the large compressibility of the La metal [ \(B\)0(La) = 25 GPa, Ref. 21], the _P_D_V term changes sign at about 5 GPa (Fig. 4). Hence, La2C3 is not necessarily a thermodynamically stable phase at all pressures covered in our experiment. A high-temperature experiment performed above 5 GPa may result in decomposition or, perhaps, the formation of a metal-rich carbide.

The Pu2C3-type structure is closely related to the anti-Th3P4-type. This similarity becomes obvious when writing the stoichiometry as La4(C2)3 instead of La2C3. The metal atoms in the Pu2C3 structure form a three-dimensional (3D) network of condensed RE8 bisphenoids. The dicarbide anions are centered at the interstitial 12\(a\) site (3/8, 0, 1/4) and oriented along the \(\overline{4}\) axes of the bisphenoids (Fig. 1) whose shape depends on the positional parameter \(x\).[22, 23] For La2C3 we have _x_(La) = 0.05, which is intermediate between nearly equal lengths of all edges (_x_ = 1/32) and equal center-corner distances (_x_ = 1/12). Near \(x\) = 0.05 the metal-metal coordination is 3+2+6 and the bisphenoids can host elongated entities.

Within the uncertainty of our data, the positional parameter _x_(La) stays constant under pressure (Fig. 4). This means that the coordination polyhedron around C2 is compressed isotropically, and there is no change in the second neighbor coordination. Actually, at ambient pressure the \(x\) parameters of all cubic rare-earth and actinide sesquicarbides cluster around 0.051 with a quite narrow spread of +-0.002.[24]

The arrangement of metal ions in La2C3 is similar to that of the \(c\)116 [16-atom body-centered cubic (bcc)] phase of high-pressure Li, which can be interpreted as a 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 superstructure of bcc.[25] In Li-_c_116 a pseudogap is formed, involving a lowering of the density of states _N_(_EF_) at the Fermi level, which leads to a decrease of the total energy relative to any of the common high-symmetry phases of elemental metals. Despite the pseudogap formation, the \(c\)116 phase of Li is a superconductor with _T_c > 10 K (see Ref. 26 and literature cited therein). As for La2C3, the Fermi level is calculated to also fall into a local minimum of the density of states (DOS).[27] This is qualitatively similar to what is reported for Y2C3.[4, 5] It is not clear whether the formation of a local DOS minimum in the sesquicarbides is a consequence of the structural distortion of the metal sublattice away from bcc. In any case, the states in the DOS minimum of Y2C3 show a strong coupling to "symmetry-preserving" metal atom displacements, i.e., a change in the \(x\) parameter.[5]

For La2C3, a C-C distance of 1.236 A is given in Ref. 3. A slightly larger distance, about 1.29 A (Ref. 8), appears more plausible. Unfortunately, our experiments do not pro

The dashed line sketches the _P_-_V_ relation of the elemental constituents La metal and carbon (diamond form) taken in appropriate amounts (16 La + 24 C). The inset shows the positional parameter _x_(La) as a function of pressure.

  vide any information on the pressure dependence of the C-C distance. This distance will correlate with the degree of charge transfer between La \(d\) and antibonding (\(\pi^{*}\)) states of the C\({}_{2}\) unit. We can expect that the charge transfer is reduced under pressure, corresponding to an increasing back-donation effect.

We now turn to LaC\({}_{2}\), the impurity phase in our sample. LaC\({}_{2}\) crystallizes in a body-centered tetragonal structure (Fig. 5). The C\({}_{2}\) units in LaC\({}_{2}\) (C-C distance 1.28 A) are reported to be oriented parallel to the \(c\) axis,[14; 28] they are sixfold coordinated by La atoms that form elongated octahedra.

The pressure-volume data of LaC\({}_{2}\) are shown in Fig. 6. Parameters obtained by fitting a Birch relation to the high-pressure data are given in Table 1. The back-extrapolated zero pressure volume given in Table 1 is 0.3% larger than \(V_{0}\)=102.0 A\({}^{3}\) measured after pressure cycling. The \(V_{0}\) value measured after cycling agrees with Ref. [14]. Despite the larger carbon-to-metal ratio, the bulk modulus of LaC\({}_{2}\) comes out slightly lower compared to LaC\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\). This may be explained by the larger metal-metal distance in LaC\({}_{2}\) (12 La-La distances of 3.93 A at ambient pressure) compared to the average value for La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\) (La-La distances are 3 \(\times\) 3.63 A, 2\(\times\) 3.81 A, 6\(\times\) 4.01 A). The inset of Fig. 6 illustrates that the \(c/a\) ratio of LaC\({}_{2}\) increases with increasing pressure, i.e., the compressibility is smaller along the direction of the dumbbell orientation.

The diffraction pattern of LaC\({}_{2}\) was completely lost at pressures above 13 GPa, but it reappeared upon releasing pressure. It is left to a separate study to find out whether LaC\({}_{2}\) undergoes a reversible pressure-induced phase transition. Already at ambient pressure, the volume of LaC\({}_{2}\) is larger than that of the constituents (LaC\({}_{2}\)=51 A\({}^{3}\) per formula unit at \(P\)=0, La+2 C =48.84 A\({}^{3}\)). So, application of pressure should be a strong driving force for a phase change, not ruling out at this point a pressure-induced amorphization as a precursor to phase separation. Another question, brought up by studies of CaC\({}_{2}\) at ambient pressure,[29; 30] concerns the orientation of the C\({}_{2}\) dumbbells in tetragonal LaC\({}_{2}\). Our data point to a possible \(c/a\) anomaly near ambient pressure (see inset of Fig. 6), which could be related to a pressure-dependent reorientation.

In conclusion, the present high-pressure structural study gives quantitative information on the equation of state and structural parameters of superconducting La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\). The results may serve as a reference for the as yet unknown high-pressure behavior of other cubic rare-earth sesquicarbides. The results are also believed to provide useful input for modeling the pressure-dependence of the electronic structure and the electron-phonon coupling of La\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{3}\).
