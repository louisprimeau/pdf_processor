###### Abstract

Superconducting and magnetic properties of La_{1-x}Tm_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} (x = 0, 0.08, and 0.16) have been investigated through measurements of both electric and magnetic properties. Tm is in a trivalent state and carries a magnetic moment \approxRu_{2}. We find that the magnetic measurements are not suited to the determination of the critical line H_{c}(T) for the onset of type-II superconductivity in materials where one has at the same time superconducting diamagnetic shielding and paramagnetic contribution due to the localized spins. On the other hand, transport experiments are much less ambiguous, and allow us to determine accurately the critical temperature in a given applied magnetic field. In particular, they allow us to suggest a more appropriate interpretation of the maximum in the magnetic-susceptibility curve already observed in materials of the same family: this maximum results from a competition between the incomplete diamagnetic shielding and the paramagnetic contribution from the magnetic ions in the mixed phase, rather than from a spin-glass freezing of the paramagnetic ions. In zero field, the rate of depression of the critical temperature upon substituting nonmagnetic La ions by magnetic Tm ions is dT/dx=-8\pm 1 K/at. % Tm.

## 1 Introduction

The series RRu_{3}Si_{2} (R stands for rare earth) is an interesting family of ternary compounds that includes various superconductors, for R = La,Y,Th,Ce, with their transition temperature T_{c} ranging from 7.3 K for R = La,1 to 1 K for R = Ce.2 On the other hand, the compounds with R = Tm,Nd are magnetic, but not superconducting. The hexagonal crystallographic structure of these materials3 is illustrated in Fig. 1. Ru atoms are located in two-dimensional sheets of triangular clusters. The Ru-Ru distance within a cluster is smaller than in the bulk ruthenium metal. An important feature is the apparent doubling of the unit cell along the c direction. This is due to a small distortion of the Ru clusters, which the structure repeats with a periodicity c=2c_{0}, with c_{0} the lattice parameter if Ru clusters were undistorted. This feature differentiates this structure from the CeO_{3}B_{2} structure where such a distortion of the Co clusters does not exist. These structural properties may be responsible for T_{c} being unusually high in LaRu_{3}Si_{2}. As the members of this series which have magnetic rare-earth (MR) atoms are not superconducting, the solid solutions La_{1-x}MR_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} form an interesting system suitable for the study of the competition between magnetism and superconductivity. La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} in the full range 0\leq x\leq 1 (Ref. [4]) is a system apart, because Ce is nonmagnetic in this material. The other system which has been studied is La_{0.95}Gd_{0.05}Ru_{3}Si_{2},5 where MR = Gd is indeed magnetic, since trivalent Gadolinium carries a spin \frac{1}{T}. Coexistence of superconductivity and spin-glass freezing was inferred from a preliminary study of mag

  netic properties of this system.

In the present work, we investigate another solid solution with _MR_ = Tm, for x = 0, 0.08, and 0.16. Magnetic and transport properties have been measured for applied magnetic fields H up to 12 kG. All the samples are type-II superconductors, and differ only by their characteristic parameters, namely flux exclusion, superconductivity transition temperature T_{c}(_H_), and higher critical field _H__c_2(_T_). Our studies suggest that the maximum in the magnetic susceptibility curve, attributed to a spin-glass freezing in the system La0.95Gd0.05Ru3Si2,5 is more likely attributable to the progressive onset of type-II superconductivity.

Both magnetic and transport properties have been investigated to analyze the superconducting behavior. We first report results of these experiments for the LaRu3Si2 matrix in Sec. III. Modifications of these properties upon introducing Tm ions in the matrix are reported in Sec. IV.

## II Experiment

La1-_x_Tm_xRu3Si2 (_x_ =0,0.08,0.16) samples have been prepared by melting the elements in an arc furnace under argon atmosphere. The nominal composition of each alloy was La1-_x_Tm_xRu3.5Si2, the excess of ruthenium preventing the formation of the LaRu2Si2 phase.1 Loss of weight during the melting was less than 0.5%. Lattice parameters deduced from the x-ray-diffraction pattern decrease with x, ranging from a = 5.675 A, c = 7.115 A for x = 0, to a = 5.635 A, c = 7.080 A for x = 0.16. Homogeneity of the samples has been checked by microprobe analysis. Magnetic susceptibility curves in fields H < 2000 G have been measured with a Faraday balance. The other magnetic properties have been measured on a MANICS magnetometer-susceptometer model DSM8. In-field electric resistivity has been measured by a capacitor bridge method described elsewhere.6 Basically, the sample and a reference resistance are fed with an alternate current source at low frequency (150 Hz). After a suitable amplification, the signals at the pins of the samples and of the reference resistance are 180deg phase shifted and then mixed. The output of the mixer is connected to a synchron amplifier acting as a null detector. The method allows a measurement of resistances 10-3 O within 10-5 O.

## III LaRu3Si2

In the normal phase, magnetic susceptibility _kh_(_T_) of LaRu3Si2 comes from the Pauli contribution of the conduction electrons, and is almost temperature independent. Deviation from the Pauli behavior can be observed upon cooling; _kh_(_T_) drops when the system enters in the superconducting state. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we have reported several _kh_(_T_) curves, obtained by cooling the sample under constant magnetic field H, for different values of this parameter. Throughout this paper, we define _kh_ = _M_/_H_, with M the magnetization. It should not be confused with the slope _dM_/_dH_ of the magnetization curves at low temperatures where the magnetization is not a linear function of H in the range of magnetic fields investigated. Let _kh__n_ designate the susceptibility in the normal state (i.e., in the nonsuperconducting state). We define the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}, as the temperature where deviation of _kh_(_T_) from _kh__n_(_T_) takes place. For each value of H, we then determine the transition temperature, marked by an arrow in Fig. 2, which defines the coordinates (_H_,_T_) of a point of the critical line in the phase diagram. Along this line shown in Fig. 3, H is the field at which the system undergoes the superconducting-normal phase transition at temperature T. It is then the upper critical line _H__c_2(_T_) of the type-II superconductor.

Figure 2: Magnetic susceptibility curves of LaRu3Si2 at magnetic fields H = 2237 G, 8600 G, and 10 785 G, for curves 1 to 3, respectively. Arrows point the temperature of the normal-superconducting transition, determined by the departure of the susceptibility from its normal behavior (broken line).

  Magnetic measurements have been complemented with the investigation of transport properties. Some resistivity curves \rho(T) are reported in Fig. 4 for several values of the static magnetic field applied to the sample. The resistivity in the normal state is nearly independent of T in the range 9 < T < 20 K, because at such low temperatures, \rho reduces to \rho_{n}, the residual resistivity of the metal in its normal state. \rho_{n} is also independent of H up to the highest field available in the experiments (12 kG), as is expected for a nonmagnetic material. At lower temperatures, however, \rho decreases and vanishes in the superconducting state. Since the variation of \rho between \rho \approx 0 and \rho \approx \rho_{n} is spread out over a temperature range of the order of 2 K, we face the question of how to determine T_{c} from the resistivity curves. In such circumstances, T_{c} is commonly defined as the temperature where \rho is a given fraction of \rho_{n}. The choice of this ratio, however, is arbitrary, ranging from \rho/\rho_{n} \approx \frac{1}{2} [which would roughly correspond to the inflection point of the \rho(T) curves] to \rho/\rho_{n} \approx 1 [which would correspond to the onset of deviations from the \rho_{n}(T) behavior]. In the present case, however, it can be determined unambiguously from the comparison between magnetic and transport properties: we choose it so that the corresponding temperature matches the transition temperature deduced from the \chi(T) curves in Fig. 2 at the same magnetic field. The result is \rho/\rho_{n} = 0.77, hence the equation of the H_{c2}(T) critical line:

\[\rho(H_{c2},T) = 0.77\rho_{n}\ .\]

The points of the H_{c2}(T) line in the phase diagram deduced from the resistivity curves, according to Eq. (1), are reported in Fig. 3, which complements the data available from the \chi(T) curves. We find T_{c} = 7.5 K for H_{c2} = 0, in reasonable agreement with the value 7.3 K reported earlier in this paper.[1] Note that at T \rightarrow T_{c}, the slope of the H_{c2}(T) line is finite, as is seen in Fig. 3, i.e.,

\[H_{c2} \propto (T-T_{c})\ .\]

This is indeed expected for a type-II superconductor, as H_{c2} is related to the coherence length \xi according to[7]

\[H_{c2} = \Phi_{0}/[2\pi\xi^{2}]\]

with \Phi_{0} = \hbar/(2e) the flux quantum. Within the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the critical exponents are classical, i.e., \xi(T) \propto (T-T_{c})^{-1/2}. Thus Eq. (2) follows from Eq. (3). The linear temperature dependence of H_{c2} is expected only in the vicinity of T_{c}. Its extrapolation down to T = 0, as it is done sometimes (see, for example, Ref. [8]), leads to an overestimation of H_{c2}(0) since H_{c2}(T) should saturate at low temperatures. Therefore, from Fig. 3, only the order of magnitude H_{c2}(0) \approx 2 \times 10^{4} G can be estimated.

The lower critical field H_{c1} at which the first flux enters the superconductor is related to H_{c2} according to the relation[9]

\[\frac{H_{c1}}{H_{c2}} = \frac{\ln\kappa}{2\kappa^{2}}\]

with \kappa = \lambda/\xi the Landau-Ginzburg parameter, \lambda being the penetration depth of the magnetic field. From the experimental point of view, H_{c1} can be defined as the field at which the magnetization curve M(H) departs from the linear behavior. We find H_{c1}(0) \approx 10^{2} G; hence, after Eq. (4), \kappa \approx 10. This material is thus a typical type-II superconductor with a large value of \kappa. H_{c1} is too small to be measured close to T_{c} with our experimental setup. Nevertheless, the linear temperature dependence of H_{c2} observed in the present work implies a similar behavior of H_{c1}(T) after Eq. (4), if we assume that \kappa is temperature independent. Such a linear behavior for H_{c1}(T) has been observed in other type-II superconductors with large \kappa.[8] We then confirm previous claims[8] that the conventional Ginzburg-Landau theory predicting linear temperature dependences of the critical fields is consistent with a local limit BCS form in type-II superconductors.

## IV \mathbf{La}_{1-x}\mathbf{Tm}_{x}\mathbf{Ru}_{3}\mathbf{Si}_{2}

### Magnetic properties

At high temperatures, magnetic susceptibility curves \chi(T) of the x = 0.08 and x = 0.16 samples exhibit a Curie-Weiss behavior, with paramagnetic Curie temperatures \Theta_{p}13.7 K and 18.4 K, respectively. Effective magnetic moment of Tm, deduced from the Curie constant, is 8.6\mu_{B} and 8.1\mu_{B} for x = 0.08 and x = 0.16 samples, respectively. This moment is larger than the theoretical value (7.5\mu_{B}) predicted by Hund's rule for the Tm^{3+} ion, and suggests that there is a significant conduction electron spin polarization around Tm^{3+} magnetic ions. Our L_{3}-edge measurements on TmRu_{3}Si_{2} show only one white line at the threshold energy of the Tm^{3+} ground configuration, and we conclude that Tm is nearly trivalent in \mathbf{La}_{1-x}\mathbf{Tm}_{x}\mathbf{Ru}_{3}\mathbf{Si}_{2} in these systems. However, the 10% increase of the magnetic moment in the x = 0.08, 0.16 samples with respect to the Tm^{3+} free-ion value gives evidence for a non-negligible hybridization of the 4f states with the conduction electron states of the matrix.

At low temperatures, \chi(T) curves show a quite different behavior, as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 for the x = 0.08 and x = 0.16 samples with the static magnetic

  field H as a parameter. Note the experimental conditions must be specified in the mixed phase, i.e., in the region between H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) lines of the phase diagram, since magnetic irreversibilities due to vortex motion are important. The \chi(T) curves in Figs. 5 and 6 are zero-field cooled curves, i.e., the sample is first cooled from a temperature significantly higher than T_{c} down to 2 K in zero magnetic field and zero-field gradient. Then the magnetic field H is applied to the sample, and \chi(T) is measured upon warming the sample at a typical rate 2 K per hour. In the normal state, \chi(T) increases upon cooling according to the Curie-Weiss contribution from the Tm localized spins. In the superconducting phase \chi(T) decreases while decreasing the temperature, and changes sign, due to the diamagnetic shielding. As a result, \chi(T) goes through a maximum at a temperature which we call T_{m}. This temperature decreases as H increases.

The shape of the \chi(T) curve near T_{m} depends on H. At low applied fields, one observes a peak which turns into a rounded maximum at relatively higher fields. We now comment on the origin for such an effect of H. In the normal state at low temperatures, onset of local magnetic correlations results in magnetic clustering effects yielding a Langevin-type contribution to the magnetization. As the effective magnetic moment associated with these magnetic clusters is large, this part of the magnetization is easily saturated in the magnetic field for T<10 K. This saturation means a negative curvature of the magnetization curve M(H), and thus a decrease of \chi_{n} as a function of H, at a given temperature, as it is observed and shown in Figs. 5 and 6. This decrease of \chi_{n}, combined with the decrease of T_{m}, explains the rounding of the high-temperature wing of the peak in \chi(T) as H increases. The rounding of the low-temperature wing has a different origin. The upper critical line H_{c2}(T) and the lower critical line H_{c1}(T) intersect at (H=0,T=T_{c}) for a type-II superconductor which, like our sample, does not belong to the family of high-T_{c} superconductors. In the limit H\to 0, the magnetic susceptibility will thus shift abruptly from its positive value in the normal state to the negative value, characteristic of the Meissner effect upon cooling through T_{c}. This explains the very sharp variation of \chi(T) in the vicinity of T_{c} at the lowest magnetic field investigated in Figs. 5 and 6. As H increases, however, there is a finite range of temperatures where the mixed phase is stable, in which \chi varies continuously as a function of T, hence the rounding of the low-temperature wing of the peak in \chi(T) when H increases.

A more detailed analysis of the magnetic properties can be achieved from the investigation of magnetization curve M(H). Such a curve is illustrated in Fig. 7 for the x=0.08 sample, at low temperature. M is negative and decreases algebraically as H increases up to some value H^{+} as expected, but then M increases with H. This is evidence of a significant paramagnetic contribution arising from a spin polarization of the Tm impurities. Indeed in the normal state, magnetic impurities polarize the electron gas in their vicinity, due to the magnetic ex

  change between the localized spin of the impurity and the spins of itinerant electrons. We have already noticed that the large value of the magnetic moment carried by the Tm ions gives evidence of the ferromagnetic cloud of the electron gas spin polarization surrounding the magnetic ions. Since magnetism opposes superconductivity, the pinning of Abrikosov vortices on the magnetic impurities realizes the stable configuration, as the core region of a vortex is in a quasinormal state. Since the amplitude of the Friedel oscillations of electron spin polarization in a normal metal scales like r^{-3} as a function of the distance from the localized spin, the effective interaction between a vortex and a magnetic impurity is long range, and attractive. Note also that the core region of a vortex is also the region where the magnetic field penetrates, so the pinning of a vortex on a magnetic impurity also realizes the configuration which minimizes the magnetic energy associated to the Zeeman term of the Hamiltonian. On one hand this effect contributes to the pinning of a vortex on a magnetic impurity. On another hand the magnetic impurity will be spin polarized by the magnetic field which penetrates the core region of the vortex in the mixed phase. We can then understand the magnetization curves M(H) at given temperature T\!<\!T_{c} as follows. At low magnetic fields, M is negative and decreases in algebraic value as a result of the diamagnetic shielding, and goes through a minimum at H\!=\!H^{+}. At larger fields, M increases with H, due to the paramagnetic contribution of the magnetic ions in the core region of the vortices in the mixed phase, and does not saturate for two reasons. First, the applied magnetic field is not large enough so that the spin polarization of the localized spins in the core region of the vortices is not saturated. Second, as H increases, so does the concentration of vortices in the mixed phase and therefore the fraction of localized spins involved in the core regions penetrated by the magnetic field. Only at still larger magnetic fields will the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) be reached, above which the magnetization curve will match that of the normal state.

Figure 8 illustrates the magnetic hysteresis curve of the x\!=\!0.08 sample at 4.3 K. Jumps of magnetization and oscillations are observed (broken curve in Fig. 8). They are characteristic of type-II superconductivity, and take their origin in the motion of vortices induced by a variation of the magnetic field in the mixed phase. This motion implies a dissipation, and thus a local heating, which in turn favors the penetration of vortices in this region, a source of additional heating. Instability can take place when this heating is larger than the initial fluctuation of temperature. These magnetothermal instabilities can be evidenced either as jumps in the magnetization or as jumps of temperature, as the magnetic field is varied. They have been first evidenced in the 1960s, [10, 11, 12] due to their importance in the technology of superconducting coils. Similar effects have also been observed in high-T_{c} superconductors, [13] and recent systematic studies have elucidated their origin. [14] The study of such instabilities is beyond the scope of the present work, and would require a record of the magnetization data at interval steps which are small with respect to the period of the oscillations, in contrast with the data in Fig. 8.

### Transport properties

For the x\!=\!0.08 and x\!=\!0.16 samples, the transition between superconducting and normal state occurs in the range of temperatures T\!<\!\Theta where the Curie-Weiss law does not apply, so that the law for \chi_{n}(T) is basically unknown. As a consequence, it becomes impossible to determine when the experimental curve \chi(T) deviates from \chi_{n}(T). This is a major difference with the x\!=\!0 sample, in which the onset of such deviation was used to determine T_{c}. Since \chi_{n}(T) increases upon cooling, T_{m} is a lower limit for the superconducting transition temperature. Still in the low-field limit, the peak in \chi(T) is sharp, so that T_{m} becomes a reasonable estimate of the transition temperature. As H increases, however, we have argued that the peak turns in a rounded maximum, in which case the transition temperature is much larger

Figure 8: Hysteresis cycle of La_{0.97}Tm_{0.08}Ru_{3}Si_{3} at temperature T\!=\!4.3 K. The cycle starts at M\!=\!0, H\!=\!0 (zero-field-cooled state) then the arrows indicate how the cycle has been obtained. The broken part corresponds to the region where oscillations are detected (see text).

  than T_{m} and cannot be determined from magnetic measurements. Transport experiments then become of primary importance to determine T_{c}.

The resistivity curves are illustrated in Fig. 9 for x\!=\!0.08, as a function of T, for different values of H. The curves have the same \bf S shape as in the x\!=\!0 sample. In the normal state, above 7.5 K, \rho(T) saturates at a value \rho_{n} which depends on H only slightly, due to a small positive magnetoresistance. Also \rho_{n} increases with x, as Tm ions act as impurities which contribute to the residual resistivity of the metal, in the normal state. This is best evidenced in Fig. 10 where we have reported \rho(T) at H\!=\!0 for both x\!=\!0.08 and x\!=\!0.16 samples, for comparison. We then assume that Eq. (1) derived for x\!=\!0 still holds true at x\!\neq\!0, and use it to determine the transition temperature at any magnetic field H. The results are displayed in Fig. 4 for x\!=\!0.08. T_{c} is depressed by 0.7 K and 1.4 K for x\!=\!0.08 and x\!=\!0.16, respectively, with respect to x\!=\!0. Taking into account the uncertainty in the determination of x from microprobe analyses, we then find dT_{c}/dx\!=\!-8\!\pm\!1 K per atomic fraction of Tm.

It is clear from our studies that the transport studies are essential to determine unambiguously the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(H) in the materials of the kind that are of interest here. For example, for the sample x\!=\!0.08, \chi is positive down to the lowest temperature investigated for H\!>\!1600 G (see curve 14 at H\!=\!1684 G in Fig. 5). The magnetic susceptibility, as we mentioned above, consists of two opposing contributions, a paramagnetic contribution coming from the magnetic impurities, and the diamagnetic contribution due to superconductivity. At this field, the net susceptibility remains positive at all temperatures. Thus, it is difficult to infer T_{c}(H) from the susceptibility measurements. On the other hand, we infer from the in-field resistivity curves (Fig. 9) that T_{c}(H\!=\!1684 G) \!\approx\!6 K. If we call T_{0}(H) the temperature at which \chi changes sign, then it is clear that T_{c}(H)\!>\!T_{m}(H) and also T_{c}(H)\!>\!T_{0}(H).

In particular, we find the upper critical field H_{c2}(T\!\rightarrow\!0), inferred from our measurements for the sample x  material is no longer a superconductor in the limit x=1, as the extrapolation of the linear variation of T_{c} upon x leads to T_{c}=0 for x=0.9. Indeed, TmRu_{3}Si_{2} is an antiferromagnet, with a spin ordering temperature T_{N}=7 K.[1]

\chi(T) curves reported earlier[5] on La_{1-x}Gd_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} are quite similar to those we have reported in Figs. 5 and 6 for La_{1-x}Tm_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2}. The maximum in \chi(T), in absence of the resistivity data, was attributed to a spin-glass transition, occurring at temperature T_{g}\approx T_{m}. This interpretation should be modified for several reasons. First, considering that the spin ordering temperature is 7 K for La_{1-x}Tm_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} in the pure x=1 case, it is quite difficult to believe that spin ordering may occur at T_{m}\approx 5 K in a system which is tenfold diluted. Second, T_{m} is about the same (\approx 5\pm 0.5 K) for both x=0.08 and x=0.16 samples (a variation of x by a factor 2). Then a relation T_{g}\approx T_{m} violates the scaling law T_{g}\propto x, which holds for the spin-glass freezing in metallic spin glasses.[17] Finally, an analysis based on many systems shows that[18] (dT_{g}/dx=0.04\;dT_{c}/dx according to Abrikosov-Gorkov and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions. In the present case, T_{g}(x=0.08) would be the order of 30 mK. We are thus led to the conclusion that the maximum in \chi(T) results from the gradual onset of superconductivity rather than spin ordering. Indeed, we have argued that the shape of the susceptibility peak, and its rounding as H increases is consistent with this interpretation.

## VI Conclusion

We have presented here the results of our dc-susceptibility measurements on the superconducting materials La_{1-x}Tm_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} (x=0.08, 0.16). Our L_{3}-edge measurements show that the Tm ions are essentially in the trivalent state. However, the effective moment of the Tm ions is \approx 8\mu_{B}, which is higher by about 10% than the free-ion value of Tm^{3+} ions. This implies a significant ferromagnetic contribution from the conduction electron spin polarization around the Tm magnetic ions. We have argued that in such systems, where the magnetic susceptibility has two contributions (one a paramagnetic contribution coming from the magnetic impurities, and the other being the diamagnetic shielding from the superconductivity), resistivity measurements provide an unambiguous determination of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(H). In high applied magnetic fields, one may not see a diamagnetic susceptibility, but the resistivity does show a signature of superconductivity.

###### Abstract

Superconducting and magnetic properties of La_{1-x}Tm_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} (x = 0, 0.08, and 0.16) have been investigated through measurements of both electric and magnetic properties. Tm is in a trivalent state and carries a magnetic moment \approxRu_{2}. We find that the magnetic measurements are not suited to the determination of the critical line H_{c}(T) for the onset of type-II superconductivity in materials where one has at the same time superconducting diamagnetic shielding and paramagnetic contribution due to the localized spins. On the other hand, transport experiments are much less ambiguous, and allow us to determine accurately the critical temperature in a given applied magnetic field. In particular, they allow us to suggest a more appropriate interpretation of the maximum in the magnetic-susceptibility curve already observed in materials of the same family: this maximum results from a competition between the incomplete diamagnetic shielding and the paramagnetic contribution from the magnetic ions in the mixed phase, rather than from a spin-glass freezing of the paramagnetic ions. In zero field, the rate of depression of the critical temperature upon substituting nonmagnetic La ions by magnetic Tm ions is dT/dx=-8\pm 1 K/at. % Tm.

## 1 Introduction

The series RRu_{3}Si_{2} (R stands for rare earth) is an interesting family of ternary compounds that includes various superconductors, for R = La,Y,Th,Ce, with their transition temperature T_{c} ranging from 7.3 K for R = La,1 to 1 K for R = Ce.2 On the other hand, the compounds with R = Tm,Nd are magnetic, but not superconducting. The hexagonal crystallographic structure of these materials3 is illustrated in Fig. 1. Ru atoms are located in two-dimensional sheets of triangular clusters. The Ru-Ru distance within a cluster is smaller than in the bulk ruthenium metal. An important feature is the apparent doubling of the unit cell along the c direction. This is due to a small distortion of the Ru clusters, which the structure repeats with a periodicity c=2c_{0}, with c_{0} the lattice parameter if Ru clusters were undistorted. This feature differentiates this structure from the CeO_{3}B_{2} structure where such a distortion of the Co clusters does not exist. These structural properties may be responsible for T_{c} being unusually high in LaRu_{3}Si_{2}. As the members of this series which have magnetic rare-earth (MR) atoms are not superconducting, the solid solutions La_{1-x}MR_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} form an interesting system suitable for the study of the competition between magnetism and superconductivity. La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} in the full range 0\leq x\leq 1 (Ref. [4]) is a system apart, because Ce is nonmagnetic in this material. The other system which has been studied is La_{0.95}Gd_{0.05}Ru_{3}Si_{2},5 where MR = Gd is indeed magnetic, since trivalent Gadolinium carries a spin \frac{1}{T}. Coexistence of superconductivity and spin-glass freezing was inferred from a preliminary study of mag

  netic properties of this system.

In the present work, we investigate another solid solution with _MR_ = Tm, for x = 0, 0.08, and 0.16. Magnetic and transport properties have been measured for applied magnetic fields H up to 12 kG. All the samples are type-II superconductors, and differ only by their characteristic parameters, namely flux exclusion, superconductivity transition temperature T_{c}(_H_), and higher critical field _H__c_2(_T_). Our studies suggest that the maximum in the magnetic susceptibility curve, attributed to a spin-glass freezing in the system La0.95Gd0.05Ru3Si2,5 is more likely attributable to the progressive onset of type-II superconductivity.

Both magnetic and transport properties have been investigated to analyze the superconducting behavior. We first report results of these experiments for the LaRu3Si2 matrix in Sec. III. Modifications of these properties upon introducing Tm ions in the matrix are reported in Sec. IV.

## II Experiment

La1-_x_Tm_xRu3Si2 (_x_ =0,0.08,0.16) samples have been prepared by melting the elements in an arc furnace under argon atmosphere. The nominal composition of each alloy was La1-_x_Tm_xRu3.5Si2, the excess of ruthenium preventing the formation of the LaRu2Si2 phase.1 Loss of weight during the melting was less than 0.5%. Lattice parameters deduced from the x-ray-diffraction pattern decrease with x, ranging from a = 5.675 A, c = 7.115 A for x = 0, to a = 5.635 A, c = 7.080 A for x = 0.16. Homogeneity of the samples has been checked by microprobe analysis. Magnetic susceptibility curves in fields H < 2000 G have been measured with a Faraday balance. The other magnetic properties have been measured on a MANICS magnetometer-susceptometer model DSM8. In-field electric resistivity has been measured by a capacitor bridge method described elsewhere.6 Basically, the sample and a reference resistance are fed with an alternate current source at low frequency (150 Hz). After a suitable amplification, the signals at the pins of the samples and of the reference resistance are 180deg phase shifted and then mixed. The output of the mixer is connected to a synchron amplifier acting as a null detector. The method allows a measurement of resistances 10-3 O within 10-5 O.

## III LaRu3Si2

In the normal phase, magnetic susceptibility _kh_(_T_) of LaRu3Si2 comes from the Pauli contribution of the conduction electrons, and is almost temperature independent. Deviation from the Pauli behavior can be observed upon cooling; _kh_(_T_) drops when the system enters in the superconducting state. This is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we have reported several _kh_(_T_) curves, obtained by cooling the sample under constant magnetic field H, for different values of this parameter. Throughout this paper, we define _kh_ = _M_/_H_, with M the magnetization. It should not be confused with the slope _dM_/_dH_ of the magnetization curves at low temperatures where the magnetization is not a linear function of H in the range of magnetic fields investigated. Let _kh__n_ designate the susceptibility in the normal state (i.e., in the nonsuperconducting state). We define the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}, as the temperature where deviation of _kh_(_T_) from _kh__n_(_T_) takes place. For each value of H, we then determine the transition temperature, marked by an arrow in Fig. 2, which defines the coordinates (_H_,_T_) of a point of the critical line in the phase diagram. Along this line shown in Fig. 3, H is the field at which the system undergoes the superconducting-normal phase transition at temperature T. It is then the upper critical line _H__c_2(_T_) of the type-II superconductor.

Figure 2: Magnetic susceptibility curves of LaRu3Si2 at magnetic fields H = 2237 G, 8600 G, and 10 785 G, for curves 1 to 3, respectively. Arrows point the temperature of the normal-superconducting transition, determined by the departure of the susceptibility from its normal behavior (broken line).

  Magnetic measurements have been complemented with the investigation of transport properties. Some resistivity curves \rho(T) are reported in Fig. 4 for several values of the static magnetic field applied to the sample. The resistivity in the normal state is nearly independent of T in the range 9 < T < 20 K, because at such low temperatures, \rho reduces to \rho_{n}, the residual resistivity of the metal in its normal state. \rho_{n} is also independent of H up to the highest field available in the experiments (12 kG), as is expected for a nonmagnetic material. At lower temperatures, however, \rho decreases and vanishes in the superconducting state. Since the variation of \rho between \rho \approx 0 and \rho \approx \rho_{n} is spread out over a temperature range of the order of 2 K, we face the question of how to determine T_{c} from the resistivity curves. In such circumstances, T_{c} is commonly defined as the temperature where \rho is a given fraction of \rho_{n}. The choice of this ratio, however, is arbitrary, ranging from \rho/\rho_{n} \approx \frac{1}{2} [which would roughly correspond to the inflection point of the \rho(T) curves] to \rho/\rho_{n} \approx 1 [which would correspond to the onset of deviations from the \rho_{n}(T) behavior]. In the present case, however, it can be determined unambiguously from the comparison between magnetic and transport properties: we choose it so that the corresponding temperature matches the transition temperature deduced from the \chi(T) curves in Fig. 2 at the same magnetic field. The result is \rho/\rho_{n} = 0.77, hence the equation of the H_{c2}(T) critical line:

\[\rho(H_{c2},T) = 0.77\rho_{n}\ .\]

The points of the H_{c2}(T) line in the phase diagram deduced from the resistivity curves, according to Eq. (1), are reported in Fig. 3, which complements the data available from the \chi(T) curves. We find T_{c} = 7.5 K for H_{c2} = 0, in reasonable agreement with the value 7.3 K reported earlier in this paper.[1] Note that at T \rightarrow T_{c}, the slope of the H_{c2}(T) line is finite, as is seen in Fig. 3, i.e.,

\[H_{c2} \propto (T-T_{c})\ .\]

This is indeed expected for a type-II superconductor, as H_{c2} is related to the coherence length \xi according to[7]

\[H_{c2} = \Phi_{0}/[2\pi\xi^{2}]\]

with \Phi_{0} = \hbar/(2e) the flux quantum. Within the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the critical exponents are classical, i.e., \xi(T) \propto (T-T_{c})^{-1/2}. Thus Eq. (2) follows from Eq. (3). The linear temperature dependence of H_{c2} is expected only in the vicinity of T_{c}. Its extrapolation down to T = 0, as it is done sometimes (see, for example, Ref. [8]), leads to an overestimation of H_{c2}(0) since H_{c2}(T) should saturate at low temperatures. Therefore, from Fig. 3, only the order of magnitude H_{c2}(0) \approx 2 \times 10^{4} G can be estimated.

The lower critical field H_{c1} at which the first flux enters the superconductor is related to H_{c2} according to the relation[9]

\[\frac{H_{c1}}{H_{c2}} = \frac{\ln\kappa}{2\kappa^{2}}\]

with \kappa = \lambda/\xi the Landau-Ginzburg parameter, \lambda being the penetration depth of the magnetic field. From the experimental point of view, H_{c1} can be defined as the field at which the magnetization curve M(H) departs from the linear behavior. We find H_{c1}(0) \approx 10^{2} G; hence, after Eq. (4), \kappa \approx 10. This material is thus a typical type-II superconductor with a large value of \kappa. H_{c1} is too small to be measured close to T_{c} with our experimental setup. Nevertheless, the linear temperature dependence of H_{c2} observed in the present work implies a similar behavior of H_{c1}(T) after Eq. (4), if we assume that \kappa is temperature independent. Such a linear behavior for H_{c1}(T) has been observed in other type-II superconductors with large \kappa.[8] We then confirm previous claims[8] that the conventional Ginzburg-Landau theory predicting linear temperature dependences of the critical fields is consistent with a local limit BCS form in type-II superconductors.

## IV \mathbf{La}_{1-x}\mathbf{Tm}_{x}\mathbf{Ru}_{3}\mathbf{Si}_{2}

### Magnetic properties

At high temperatures, magnetic susceptibility curves \chi(T) of the x = 0.08 and x = 0.16 samples exhibit a Curie-Weiss behavior, with paramagnetic Curie temperatures \Theta_{p}13.7 K and 18.4 K, respectively. Effective magnetic moment of Tm, deduced from the Curie constant, is 8.6\mu_{B} and 8.1\mu_{B} for x = 0.08 and x = 0.16 samples, respectively. This moment is larger than the theoretical value (7.5\mu_{B}) predicted by Hund's rule for the Tm^{3+} ion, and suggests that there is a significant conduction electron spin polarization around Tm^{3+} magnetic ions. Our L_{3}-edge measurements on TmRu_{3}Si_{2} show only one white line at the threshold energy of the Tm^{3+} ground configuration, and we conclude that Tm is nearly trivalent in \mathbf{La}_{1-x}\mathbf{Tm}_{x}\mathbf{Ru}_{3}\mathbf{Si}_{2} in these systems. However, the 10% increase of the magnetic moment in the x = 0.08, 0.16 samples with respect to the Tm^{3+} free-ion value gives evidence for a non-negligible hybridization of the 4f states with the conduction electron states of the matrix.

At low temperatures, \chi(T) curves show a quite different behavior, as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 for the x = 0.08 and x = 0.16 samples with the static magnetic

  field H as a parameter. Note the experimental conditions must be specified in the mixed phase, i.e., in the region between H_{c1}(T) and H_{c2}(T) lines of the phase diagram, since magnetic irreversibilities due to vortex motion are important. The \chi(T) curves in Figs. 5 and 6 are zero-field cooled curves, i.e., the sample is first cooled from a temperature significantly higher than T_{c} down to 2 K in zero magnetic field and zero-field gradient. Then the magnetic field H is applied to the sample, and \chi(T) is measured upon warming the sample at a typical rate 2 K per hour. In the normal state, \chi(T) increases upon cooling according to the Curie-Weiss contribution from the Tm localized spins. In the superconducting phase \chi(T) decreases while decreasing the temperature, and changes sign, due to the diamagnetic shielding. As a result, \chi(T) goes through a maximum at a temperature which we call T_{m}. This temperature decreases as H increases.

The shape of the \chi(T) curve near T_{m} depends on H. At low applied fields, one observes a peak which turns into a rounded maximum at relatively higher fields. We now comment on the origin for such an effect of H. In the normal state at low temperatures, onset of local magnetic correlations results in magnetic clustering effects yielding a Langevin-type contribution to the magnetization. As the effective magnetic moment associated with these magnetic clusters is large, this part of the magnetization is easily saturated in the magnetic field for T<10 K. This saturation means a negative curvature of the magnetization curve M(H), and thus a decrease of \chi_{n} as a function of H, at a given temperature, as it is observed and shown in Figs. 5 and 6. This decrease of \chi_{n}, combined with the decrease of T_{m}, explains the rounding of the high-temperature wing of the peak in \chi(T) as H increases. The rounding of the low-temperature wing has a different origin. The upper critical line H_{c2}(T) and the lower critical line H_{c1}(T) intersect at (H=0,T=T_{c}) for a type-II superconductor which, like our sample, does not belong to the family of high-T_{c} superconductors. In the limit H\to 0, the magnetic susceptibility will thus shift abruptly from its positive value in the normal state to the negative value, characteristic of the Meissner effect upon cooling through T_{c}. This explains the very sharp variation of \chi(T) in the vicinity of T_{c} at the lowest magnetic field investigated in Figs. 5 and 6. As H increases, however, there is a finite range of temperatures where the mixed phase is stable, in which \chi varies continuously as a function of T, hence the rounding of the low-temperature wing of the peak in \chi(T) when H increases.

A more detailed analysis of the magnetic properties can be achieved from the investigation of magnetization curve M(H). Such a curve is illustrated in Fig. 7 for the x=0.08 sample, at low temperature. M is negative and decreases algebraically as H increases up to some value H^{+} as expected, but then M increases with H. This is evidence of a significant paramagnetic contribution arising from a spin polarization of the Tm impurities. Indeed in the normal state, magnetic impurities polarize the electron gas in their vicinity, due to the magnetic ex

  change between the localized spin of the impurity and the spins of itinerant electrons. We have already noticed that the large value of the magnetic moment carried by the Tm ions gives evidence of the ferromagnetic cloud of the electron gas spin polarization surrounding the magnetic ions. Since magnetism opposes superconductivity, the pinning of Abrikosov vortices on the magnetic impurities realizes the stable configuration, as the core region of a vortex is in a quasinormal state. Since the amplitude of the Friedel oscillations of electron spin polarization in a normal metal scales like r^{-3} as a function of the distance from the localized spin, the effective interaction between a vortex and a magnetic impurity is long range, and attractive. Note also that the core region of a vortex is also the region where the magnetic field penetrates, so the pinning of a vortex on a magnetic impurity also realizes the configuration which minimizes the magnetic energy associated to the Zeeman term of the Hamiltonian. On one hand this effect contributes to the pinning of a vortex on a magnetic impurity. On another hand the magnetic impurity will be spin polarized by the magnetic field which penetrates the core region of the vortex in the mixed phase. We can then understand the magnetization curves M(H) at given temperature T\!<\!T_{c} as follows. At low magnetic fields, M is negative and decreases in algebraic value as a result of the diamagnetic shielding, and goes through a minimum at H\!=\!H^{+}. At larger fields, M increases with H, due to the paramagnetic contribution of the magnetic ions in the core region of the vortices in the mixed phase, and does not saturate for two reasons. First, the applied magnetic field is not large enough so that the spin polarization of the localized spins in the core region of the vortices is not saturated. Second, as H increases, so does the concentration of vortices in the mixed phase and therefore the fraction of localized spins involved in the core regions penetrated by the magnetic field. Only at still larger magnetic fields will the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) be reached, above which the magnetization curve will match that of the normal state.

Figure 8 illustrates the magnetic hysteresis curve of the x\!=\!0.08 sample at 4.3 K. Jumps of magnetization and oscillations are observed (broken curve in Fig. 8). They are characteristic of type-II superconductivity, and take their origin in the motion of vortices induced by a variation of the magnetic field in the mixed phase. This motion implies a dissipation, and thus a local heating, which in turn favors the penetration of vortices in this region, a source of additional heating. Instability can take place when this heating is larger than the initial fluctuation of temperature. These magnetothermal instabilities can be evidenced either as jumps in the magnetization or as jumps of temperature, as the magnetic field is varied. They have been first evidenced in the 1960s, [10, 11, 12] due to their importance in the technology of superconducting coils. Similar effects have also been observed in high-T_{c} superconductors, [13] and recent systematic studies have elucidated their origin. [14] The study of such instabilities is beyond the scope of the present work, and would require a record of the magnetization data at interval steps which are small with respect to the period of the oscillations, in contrast with the data in Fig. 8.

### Transport properties

For the x\!=\!0.08 and x\!=\!0.16 samples, the transition between superconducting and normal state occurs in the range of temperatures T\!<\!\Theta where the Curie-Weiss law does not apply, so that the law for \chi_{n}(T) is basically unknown. As a consequence, it becomes impossible to determine when the experimental curve \chi(T) deviates from \chi_{n}(T). This is a major difference with the x\!=\!0 sample, in which the onset of such deviation was used to determine T_{c}. Since \chi_{n}(T) increases upon cooling, T_{m} is a lower limit for the superconducting transition temperature. Still in the low-field limit, the peak in \chi(T) is sharp, so that T_{m} becomes a reasonable estimate of the transition temperature. As H increases, however, we have argued that the peak turns in a rounded maximum, in which case the transition temperature is much larger

Figure 8: Hysteresis cycle of La_{0.97}Tm_{0.08}Ru_{3}Si_{3} at temperature T\!=\!4.3 K. The cycle starts at M\!=\!0, H\!=\!0 (zero-field-cooled state) then the arrows indicate how the cycle has been obtained. The broken part corresponds to the region where oscillations are detected (see text).

  than T_{m} and cannot be determined from magnetic measurements. Transport experiments then become of primary importance to determine T_{c}.

The resistivity curves are illustrated in Fig. 9 for x\!=\!0.08, as a function of T, for different values of H. The curves have the same \bf S shape as in the x\!=\!0 sample. In the normal state, above 7.5 K, \rho(T) saturates at a value \rho_{n} which depends on H only slightly, due to a small positive magnetoresistance. Also \rho_{n} increases with x, as Tm ions act as impurities which contribute to the residual resistivity of the metal, in the normal state. This is best evidenced in Fig. 10 where we have reported \rho(T) at H\!=\!0 for both x\!=\!0.08 and x\!=\!0.16 samples, for comparison. We then assume that Eq. (1) derived for x\!=\!0 still holds true at x\!\neq\!0, and use it to determine the transition temperature at any magnetic field H. The results are displayed in Fig. 4 for x\!=\!0.08. T_{c} is depressed by 0.7 K and 1.4 K for x\!=\!0.08 and x\!=\!0.16, respectively, with respect to x\!=\!0. Taking into account the uncertainty in the determination of x from microprobe analyses, we then find dT_{c}/dx\!=\!-8\!\pm\!1 K per atomic fraction of Tm.

It is clear from our studies that the transport studies are essential to determine unambiguously the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(H) in the materials of the kind that are of interest here. For example, for the sample x\!=\!0.08, \chi is positive down to the lowest temperature investigated for H\!>\!1600 G (see curve 14 at H\!=\!1684 G in Fig. 5). The magnetic susceptibility, as we mentioned above, consists of two opposing contributions, a paramagnetic contribution coming from the magnetic impurities, and the diamagnetic contribution due to superconductivity. At this field, the net susceptibility remains positive at all temperatures. Thus, it is difficult to infer T_{c}(H) from the susceptibility measurements. On the other hand, we infer from the in-field resistivity curves (Fig. 9) that T_{c}(H\!=\!1684 G) \!\approx\!6 K. If we call T_{0}(H) the temperature at which \chi changes sign, then it is clear that T_{c}(H)\!>\!T_{m}(H) and also T_{c}(H)\!>\!T_{0}(H).

In particular, we find the upper critical field H_{c2}(T\!\rightarrow\!0), inferred from our measurements for the sample x  material is no longer a superconductor in the limit x=1, as the extrapolation of the linear variation of T_{c} upon x leads to T_{c}=0 for x=0.9. Indeed, TmRu_{3}Si_{2} is an antiferromagnet, with a spin ordering temperature T_{N}=7 K.[1]

\chi(T) curves reported earlier[5] on La_{1-x}Gd_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} are quite similar to those we have reported in Figs. 5 and 6 for La_{1-x}Tm_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2}. The maximum in \chi(T), in absence of the resistivity data, was attributed to a spin-glass transition, occurring at temperature T_{g}\approx T_{m}. This interpretation should be modified for several reasons. First, considering that the spin ordering temperature is 7 K for La_{1-x}Tm_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} in the pure x=1 case, it is quite difficult to believe that spin ordering may occur at T_{m}\approx 5 K in a system which is tenfold diluted. Second, T_{m} is about the same (\approx 5\pm 0.5 K) for both x=0.08 and x=0.16 samples (a variation of x by a factor 2). Then a relation T_{g}\approx T_{m} violates the scaling law T_{g}\propto x, which holds for the spin-glass freezing in metallic spin glasses.[17] Finally, an analysis based on many systems shows that[18] (dT_{g}/dx=0.04\;dT_{c}/dx according to Abrikosov-Gorkov and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions. In the present case, T_{g}(x=0.08) would be the order of 30 mK. We are thus led to the conclusion that the maximum in \chi(T) results from the gradual onset of superconductivity rather than spin ordering. Indeed, we have argued that the shape of the susceptibility peak, and its rounding as H increases is consistent with this interpretation.

## VI Conclusion

We have presented here the results of our dc-susceptibility measurements on the superconducting materials La_{1-x}Tm_{x}Ru_{3}Si_{2} (x=0.08, 0.16). Our L_{3}-edge measurements show that the Tm ions are essentially in the trivalent state. However, the effective moment of the Tm ions is \approx 8\mu_{B}, which is higher by about 10% than the free-ion value of Tm^{3+} ions. This implies a significant ferromagnetic contribution from the conduction electron spin polarization around the Tm magnetic ions. We have argued that in such systems, where the magnetic susceptibility has two contributions (one a paramagnetic contribution coming from the magnetic impurities, and the other being the diamagnetic shielding from the superconductivity), resistivity measurements provide an unambiguous determination of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(H). In high applied magnetic fields, one may not see a diamagnetic susceptibility, but the resistivity does show a signature of superconductivity.
