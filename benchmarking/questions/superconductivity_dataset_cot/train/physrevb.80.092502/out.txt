###### Abstract

Single-crystalline FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} with a sharp superconducting transition at T_{c}\sim14 K is synthesized via slow furnace cooling followed by low-temperature annealing. The effect of annealing on the chemical and superconducting inhomogeneities is carefully characterized. We also report resistivity, magnetization, and magneto-optical images of this crystal. Based on the Bean model, critical current density is estimated to exceed 1 \times 10^{5} A/cm^{2} below 5 K under zero field. Weak fish-tail effect is identified at lower temperatures.

Since the discovery of iron-based oxypnictide superconductor LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} with T_{c}\sim 26 K,^{1} the transition temperature has been raised up to 55 K in RFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (R = rare earths).^{2} In addition to these iron oxypnictides, oxygen-free iron pnictides such as Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} (T_{c}\sim 38 K) (Ref. 3) or Li_{1-x}FeAs (T_{c}\sim 18 K) (Ref. 4) were found. All these iron pnictides have layered structures with conducting FeAs layers sandwiched between blocking layers. These discoveries of iron-pnictide superconductors were followed by another new family of iron-based superconductors, iron chalcogenide Fe_{1+\delta}Se with T_{c}\sim 8 K (Ref. 5) and its substituted compounds Fe_{1+\gamma}(Te_{x}Se_{1-x}).^{6} In contrast to iron arsenides, this system has only conducting Fe X (X: chalcogens) layers, equivalent to FeAs layers in iron arsenides. Due to its simpler structure compared to iron pnictides and less toxics nature, iron chalcogenides could be more suitable for practical applications despite their lower T_{c}. However, synthesis of high-quality iron chalcogenides is not straightforward. Although the first paper reported a clean superconducting phase only in Se deficient sample,^{5} detailed structural analyses on polycrystalline samples indicate the presence of excess Fe between Fe(Te, Se) layers.^{7} It is also reported that superconductivity in Fe_{1+\delta}Se is very sensitive to synthesis condition, and only samples with small \delta show superconductivity.^{8} To elucidate superconducting mechanism, high-quality single crystals with reasonable value of critical current density, J_{c}, are indispensable. Such crystals are also important to evaluate whether iron chalcogenides are suitable for applications utilizing high-current-carrying capability, such as cables and magnets. Single crystal growth of FeSe has been attempted using NaCl flux, resulting in tiny crystals with T_{c}\sim 10.4 K.^{9} Recently, however, large single crystals of Fe_{1+y}Te or Fe_{1+y}Te_{x}Se_{1-x} with the tetragonal structure have been successfully grown by Bridgman method.^{10,11}

In this Brief Report, we report synthesis and characterization of high-quality single crystals of FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} grown by slow cooling and low-temperature annealing. The homogeneity of the obtained crystal is examined by compositional analysis and magneto-optical (MO) imaging, in addition to standard characterizations of structure, magnetization, and resistivity.

Single-crystalline samples with nominal composition FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5} were prepared from Fe grains (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, 99.99%), Te powder (same as above, 99.999%), and Se grains (same as above, 99.999%). More than 10 g of stoichiometric quantities were loaded into a small silica tube with d_{1}\sim 10 mm\phi, evacuated, and sealed. This tube was sealed into a second evacuated tube with d_{2}\sim 20 mm\phi. The whole assembly was heated up to 1070 ^{\circ}C for 36 h, followed by slow cooling down to 710 ^{\circ}C at a rate of 6 ^{\circ}C/h. After that, it was furnace cooled to room temperature. The obtained crystals (as grown) does not show superconductivity except for a small part as discussed below. As-grown crystals were then sealed into a small silica ampoule under vacuum and annealed at 400 ^{\circ}C for more than 10 days, followed by quenching. The obtained crystal cleaves perpendicular to c axis. Typical dimensions of the crystal with flat surface are 5 \times 5 \times 1 mm^{3}.

The phase purity and the chemical composition of the crystals were confirmed by powder x-ray diffraction (Cu K\alpha, M18XHF, MAC Science) and EDX (S-4300, Hitachi High-Technologies equipped with EMAX x-act, HORIBA), respectively. Magnetization was measured by a commercial SQUID magnetometer (MPMS-XLS, Quantum Design). The resistivity measurements were performed by four-contact method. In order to decrease the contact resistance, we sputtered gold on the contact pads just after the cleavage, and 25 \mum gold lead wires were attached with silver paste (Dupont 4922). Magneto-optical images were obtained by using the local field-dependent Faraday effect in the in-plane magnetized garnet indicator film employing a differential method.^{12,13}

Figure 1(a) shows powder x-ray diffraction pattern for the as-grown and annealed samples. We crashed several pieces of crystals with total weight of about 10 mg into powder. So, the obtained powder inevitably contains crystals with a spread of lattice constants, giving slightly broad peaks and even some impurity phases. The Laue photograph (not shown) of a crystal with a similar composition clearly indicated a fourfold pattern, indicating that our samples are really single crystals. In addition, a similar x-ray pattern using smaller amount of crystals gives narrower peak widths. All these facts indicate that the crystallographic quality of small piece of crystals used in the remainder of the Brief Report is sufficiently high, although it has not been checked individually. The sample is phase pure except for a small amount of Fe_{7}Se_{8}. The amount of Fe_{7}Se_{8} is strongly reduced after annealing, which indicates that annealing makes them more homogeneous. In order to confirm this assumption, we ob tained compositional data of several regions in both samples by EDX analyses. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) shows the composition map of the as-grown and annealed samples, respectively. It is clear that inhomogeneous Se/Te distribution is greatly improved by annealing. The lattice constants determined by x-ray diffraction data are a = 3.813 A, c = 6.100 A and a = 3.798 A, c = 6.052 A for as-grown and annealed samples, respectively. The latter values of lattice parameters are very close to those reported for Fe_{1.01}Fe_{0.54}Se_{0.56} single crystal.[11] The chemical composition of the annealed sample determined by EDX analyses is FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39}.

Figure 2(a) shows temperature dependence of zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization at 5 Oe. Very sharp transition starting at _T_{c}_\sim 14 K is observed. We note that many of the as-grown samples do not show superconductivity. Figure 2(b) shows temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity in FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39}. Resistivity shows a typical metallic temperature dependence only below 150 K. In Ref. [11], a similar metallic temperature dependence of resistivity is reported only for crystals with compositions close to FeTe_{0.5}Se_{0.5}. In our FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39}, resistivity is nearly constant at higher temperatures. Such a weak temperature dependence of resistivity is not for a typical metal. In addition, the value of resistivity at _T_{c}_ is \sim400 \mu\Omega cm, which is even higher than that in Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [14]) with disorder in FeAs planes. This value is twice as large as that for Fe_{0.99}Te_{0.51}Se_{0.49} reported in Ref. [11]. However, the value of resistivity is very sensitive to the Se content, and temperature dependence of resistivity becomes almost flat or even semiconducting down to _T_{c}_ in crystals with _x_> 0.55.[11] It is possible that microscopic inhomogeneities still present in our crystal are responsible for such an anomalous temperature dependence and large residual resistivity.

Figure 3(a) depicts the magnetization at several temperatures as a function of field. From the magnetization hysteresis loop, we can obtain the critical current density _J_{c}_ using the Bean model with the assumption of field-independent _J_{c}_. According to the Bean model,[15]J_{c} is given by

\[J_{c}=20\frac{\Delta M}{a(1-a/3b)}.\] (1)

where \Delta M is _M_{\rm down}_-_M_{\rm up}_, _M_{\rm up}_ and _M_{\rm down}_ are the magnetization when sweeping fields up and down, respectively, a and b are sample widths (_a_ < _b_). Figure 3(b) shows the field dependence of _J_{c}_ obtained from the data shown in Fig. 3(a) using Eq. (1) and effective sample dimensions a \sim 320 \mum and b \sim 735 \mum. A nonmonotonic field dependence of _J_{c}_ with a broad maximum, fish-tail effect, is observed below 7.5 K as shown in Fig. 3(a). This behavior is similar to Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystals,[14, 16] YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\theta}[17] and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4-\theta}[18] The fish-tail effect is more clearly seen in field dependence of critical current densities _J_{c}_ [Fig. 3(b)]. Critical current density calculated from _M-H_ curve is esti

  mated to be 1\times 10^{5} A/cm^{2} at 5 K under zero field. It should be noted that this large value of J_{\rm c} cannot be sustained by the surface superconductivity. Although this value of J_{\rm c} is 1/6 of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystals, it is still within the range for practical applications.[14]

The above estimate of J_{\rm c} relies on the assumption that homogeneous current is flowing within the sample (full critical state). To examine this assumption, we made MO imaging of 25 \mum thick FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} in the remanent state at several temperatures. The state is prepared by applying 800 Oe along c axis for 1 s and removing it after zero-field cooling. Figures 4(a)-4(d) show MO images of FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} in the remanent state at 4.2, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 K, respectively. Figure 4(e) shows profiles of the magnetic induction at several temperatures along the line shown in Fig. 4(a). Since the maximum field of 800 Oe is not enough to create a full critical state at lower temperatures, the profile is split below 5 K. At lower temperatures, the MO image shows a typical roof-top pattern indicating a nearly uniform current flow in the sample. However, it should be noted that the uniformity of the current is much less compared with that in Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}.[14] Still, the uniform current flow is only partly disturbed even at 1.5 K below the bulk T_{c}. A MO image of an as-grown sample at T=10 K is also shown in Fig. 4(f). It is evident that the sample is superconducting in a limited region and the trapped field is much lower than that in the annealed sample. All these MO images show that a full critical state is achieved only in the annealed sample. J_{\rm c} for a thin superconductor is roughly estimated by J_{\rm c}\sim\Delta B/t, where \Delta B is the trapped field and t is the thickness of the sample. With \Delta B\sim 230 G and t=25 \mum, J_{\rm c} is estimated as \sim0.9 \times 10^{5} A/cm^{2} at 7.5 K, which is consistent with the value calculated from M-H curve.

At this point, we emphasize the effect of annealing on chemical and superconducting homogeneities in FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39}. The x-ray diffraction pattern and EDX mapping data reveal that the annealing at low temperature for an extended period of time is essential to obtain homogeneous samples. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the annealed sample has much less impurity phases than the as-grown one, possibly because the low-temperature annealing prohibits phase separation. The annealing effect on superconductivity is also seen in magnetization. The temperature-dependent magnetization shows a sharp superconducting transition in the annealed sample, though many of as-grown sample do not show superconductivity above 2 K. This is probably because homogenization as a consequence of annealing makes Te/Se ratio optimum for superconductivity. MO images demonstrate this improvement more clearly. The MO image, shown in Fig. 4(f) clearly shows large superconducting inhomogeneities in the as-grown crystal. As seen in Figs. 4(a)-4(d), annealing makes the sample homogeneous and improves superconductivity. Besides, we could obtain appreciable hysteresis of magnetization in the annealed crystals. Such a large hysteresis in M-H curve is exceptional, since there have been only a limited number of reports on the M-H curves in Fe

  chalcogenides.[5, 19] In addition, several studies have reported a large ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic background,[8, 19] which may mask the intrinsic M-H characteristics. We also emphasize the simplicity of our method. We could obtain high-quality single-crystalline FeTe_{x}Se_{1-x} through a simple method of slow cooling followed by annealing, while Chen _et al.[10]_ and Sales _et al.[11]_ reported FeTe_{x}Se_{1-x} crystal growth by Bridgman method. \Delta T_{c} of our FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} is comparable or smaller than the previous report with a similar T_{c}.[11] It should be noted, however, that the optimum composition which produces the most homogeneous superconductivity with highest T_{c} in FeTe_{x}Se_{1-x} is still unclear, since the optimum composition is slightly different between our crystal and those reported in Ref. [11]. Further works are necessary to sort out the optimum composition and annealing condition.

In summary, we have prepared high-quality single-crystalline FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} with T_{c}\sim 14 K by slow-cooling method followed by low-temperature annealing. Magnetocritical imaging revealed nearly homogeneous current flow in the crystal. The value of J_{c} is over 1\times 10^{5} A/cm^{2} below 5 K under zero field. J_{c}-H characteristics show a fish-tail effect in the intermediate temperature range, which is a promising characteristics for practical superconductors. The obtained high-quality FeTe_{x}Se_{1-x} crystal is expected to serve as a platform for the investigation of superconducting mechanism in the iron-chalcogenide system.

where \Delta M is _M_{\rm down}_-_M_{\rm up}_, _M_{\rm up}_ and _M_{\rm down}_ are the magnetization when sweeping fields up and down, respectively, a and b are sample widths (_a_ < _b_). Figure 3(b) shows the field dependence of _J_{c}_ obtained from the data shown in Fig. 3(a) using Eq. (1) and effective sample dimensions a \sim 320 \mum and b \sim 735 \mum. A nonmonotonic field dependence of _J_{c}_ with a broad maximum, fish-tail effect, is observed below 7.5 K as shown in Fig. 3(a). This behavior is similar to Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystals,[14, 16] YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\theta}[17] and La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4-\theta}[18] The fish-tail effect is more clearly seen in field dependence of critical current densities _J_{c}_ [Fig. 3(b)]. Critical current density calculated from _M-H_ curve is esti

  mated to be 1\times 10^{5} A/cm^{2} at 5 K under zero field. It should be noted that this large value of J_{\rm c} cannot be sustained by the surface superconductivity. Although this value of J_{\rm c} is 1/6 of Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystals, it is still within the range for practical applications.[14]

The above estimate of J_{\rm c} relies on the assumption that homogeneous current is flowing within the sample (full critical state). To examine this assumption, we made MO imaging of 25 \mum thick FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} in the remanent state at several temperatures. The state is prepared by applying 800 Oe along c axis for 1 s and removing it after zero-field cooling. Figures 4(a)-4(d) show MO images of FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} in the remanent state at 4.2, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 K, respectively. Figure 4(e) shows profiles of the magnetic induction at several temperatures along the line shown in Fig. 4(a). Since the maximum field of 800 Oe is not enough to create a full critical state at lower temperatures, the profile is split below 5 K. At lower temperatures, the MO image shows a typical roof-top pattern indicating a nearly uniform current flow in the sample. However, it should be noted that the uniformity of the current is much less compared with that in Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2}.[14] Still, the uniform current flow is only partly disturbed even at 1.5 K below the bulk T_{c}. A MO image of an as-grown sample at T=10 K is also shown in Fig. 4(f). It is evident that the sample is superconducting in a limited region and the trapped field is much lower than that in the annealed sample. All these MO images show that a full critical state is achieved only in the annealed sample. J_{\rm c} for a thin superconductor is roughly estimated by J_{\rm c}\sim\Delta B/t, where \Delta B is the trapped field and t is the thickness of the sample. With \Delta B\sim 230 G and t=25 \mum, J_{\rm c} is estimated as \sim0.9 \times 10^{5} A/cm^{2} at 7.5 K, which is consistent with the value calculated from M-H curve.

At this point, we emphasize the effect of annealing on chemical and superconducting homogeneities in FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39}. The x-ray diffraction pattern and EDX mapping data reveal that the annealing at low temperature for an extended period of time is essential to obtain homogeneous samples. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the annealed sample has much less impurity phases than the as-grown one, possibly because the low-temperature annealing prohibits phase separation. The annealing effect on superconductivity is also seen in magnetization. The temperature-dependent magnetization shows a sharp superconducting transition in the annealed sample, though many of as-grown sample do not show superconductivity above 2 K. This is probably because homogenization as a consequence of annealing makes Te/Se ratio optimum for superconductivity. MO images demonstrate this improvement more clearly. The MO image, shown in Fig. 4(f) clearly shows large superconducting inhomogeneities in the as-grown crystal. As seen in Figs. 4(a)-4(d), annealing makes the sample homogeneous and improves superconductivity. Besides, we could obtain appreciable hysteresis of magnetization in the annealed crystals. Such a large hysteresis in M-H curve is exceptional, since there have been only a limited number of reports on the M-H curves in Fe

  chalcogenides.[5, 19] In addition, several studies have reported a large ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic background,[8, 19] which may mask the intrinsic M-H characteristics. We also emphasize the simplicity of our method. We could obtain high-quality single-crystalline FeTe_{x}Se_{1-x} through a simple method of slow cooling followed by annealing, while Chen _et al.[10]_ and Sales _et al.[11]_ reported FeTe_{x}Se_{1-x} crystal growth by Bridgman method. \Delta T_{c} of our FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} is comparable or smaller than the previous report with a similar T_{c}.[11] It should be noted, however, that the optimum composition which produces the most homogeneous superconductivity with highest T_{c} in FeTe_{x}Se_{1-x} is still unclear, since the optimum composition is slightly different between our crystal and those reported in Ref. [11]. Further works are necessary to sort out the optimum composition and annealing condition.

In summary, we have prepared high-quality single-crystalline FeTe_{0.61}Se_{0.39} with T_{c}\sim 14 K by slow-cooling method followed by low-temperature annealing. Magnetocritical imaging revealed nearly homogeneous current flow in the crystal. The value of J_{c} is over 1\times 10^{5} A/cm^{2} below 5 K under zero field. J_{c}-H characteristics show a fish-tail effect in the intermediate temperature range, which is a promising characteristics for practical superconductors. The obtained high-quality FeTe_{x}Se_{1-x} crystal is expected to serve as a platform for the investigation of superconducting mechanism in the iron-chalcogenide system.
