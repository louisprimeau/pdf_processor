###### Abstract

The microwave complex surface impedance Z_{s} of Y(Ni_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}B_{2}C was measured at 0.5 K under magnetic fields H up to 7 T. In nominally pure YNi_{2}B_{2}C, which is a strongly anisotropic s-wave superconductor, the flux flow resistivity \rho_{f} calculated from Z_{s} was twice as large as that expected from the conventional normal-state vortex core model. In Pt-doped samples where the gap anisotropy is smeared out, the enhancement of \rho_{f} is reduced and \rho_{f} approaches the conventional behavior. These results indicate that the energy dissipation in the vortex core is strongly affected by the anisotropy of the superconducting gap.

## I Introduction

In conventional phonon-mediated superconductors, the symmetry of the pair wave function is of s-wave type, and the superconducting gap (SG) is isotropic in momentum space. However, pair wave functions with higher angular momenta are believed to occur in superconductors where strong interactions among electrons play an important role. In such unconventional superconductors, the SG's are anisotropic and can have nodes.[1, 2] In general, even in s-wave superconductors, the SG can be strongly anisotropic.[3]

In superconductors with anisotropic SG's, low-energy quasiparticle (QP) excitations near the gap nodes play an important role. Volovik examined the effects of gap nodes on the QP density of states (DOS) in the mixed state.[4] He pointed out that the QP DOS at the Fermi energy \epsilon_{F} in superconductors with line nodes varies proportionally to \sqrt{H}, in contrast to the case of conventional superconductors with an isotropic SG where the QP DOS at \epsilon_{F} is linear in H, that is, proportional to the number of vortices. Such an enhancement of the QP DOS in anisotropic superconductors has been observed experimentally in d-wave high-T_{c} cuprates[5, 6] and the heavy fermion superconductor UPt_{3} (Ref. [7]) by electronic specific heat measurements.

Besides the QP DOS, gap nodes are expected to affect the flux flow resistivity \rho_{f}. Basically, \rho_{f} is a measure of the QP relaxation _in and around_ the vortex core, and can provide different information from the QP DOS. In dirty superconductors where the QP mean free path l is shorter than the coherence length \xi, the vortex core can be treated as a bulk normal metal with a radius of the order of \xi.[8] As a result, \rho_{f} is simply given by \rho_{f}\sim\rho_{n}/H/H_{c2} regardless of the anisotropy of the SG. In moderately clean superconductors where \xi<l<\xi\epsilon_{F}/\Delta (\Delta is the gap amplitude), however, the vortex core cannot be regarded as a simple normal metal at all, since the QP's are reflected at the edge of the vortex core before they experience impurity scattering. In this regime, \rho_{f} is given by \rho_{f}=H/(ne\langle\omega_{0}\tau_{c}\rangle_{F}).[9] Here n is a carrier density, e is a unit charge, \omega_{0}\sim\Delta^{2}/\epsilon_{F} is the precession frequency of the lowest Andreev bound state,[10]\tau_{c} is the relaxation time in the vortex core, and \langle\cdots\rangle_{F} denotes the average over the Fermi surface. In such a case, nodes in the SG should affect both \omega_{0} and \tau_{c}. First, \omega_{0} in anisotropic superconductors depends on the QP momentum and should be very small near the gap nodes. Second, \tau_{c} can be short because the QP DOS which contributes to the impurity scattering is enhanced in anisotropic superconductors. Both these factors are expected to enhance \rho_{f} from clean isotropic superconductors.

To date, UPt_{3} is the only clean anisotropic superconductor in which \rho_{f} has been measured. The enhancement of \rho_{f} has actually been observed.[11, 12] However, since UPt_{3} is a complicated odd-parity superconductor,[13] it should be noted that many factors other than gap anisotropy can contribute to \rho_{f}. In fact, Lutke-Entrup _et al._ attributed the origin of the \rho_{f} enhancement to the unconventional vortex core structure which is brought by the two-component order parameter.[12] In addition, Kato showed that the parity and chirality of the pair wave function affect \tau_{c} in the moderately clean regime.[14] Therefore, it is still unclear whether \rho_{f} enhancement in UPt_{3} is brought by the gap anisotropy or by the other unconventional nature of superconductivity.

To make clear the effects of gap anisotropy on \rho_{f}, measurement on a _clean, anisotropic, and s-wave_ superconductor is indispensable. From this point of view, we measured the \rho_{f} of Y(Ni_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}B_{2}C. The temperature and magnetic-field dependence of the electronic specific heat,[15, 16] thermal conductivity,[17, 18] and NMR relaxation rate[19] indicate that there are low-lying QP states near \epsilon_{F} even in the superconducting state. This is strong evidence for the huge anisotropy of the SG in YNi_{2}B_{2}C. Recently, Izawa _et al._ suggested, from thermal conductivity measurements under various magnetic field directions that there are point-like gap nodes along the [100] and [010] directions.[18] In addition, it is reported that the introduction of impurities _reduces_ the low-lying QP states and opens the gap all over the Fermi surface with little effect on T_{c}.[15, 20] Such a behavior is totally different from that expected in d- or p-wave superconductors,[21] and provides strong evidence of _anisotropic s-wave_ superconductivity in YNi_{2}B_{2}C. Therefore, by comparing the results in pure (anisotropic) and impurity-doped (isotropic) YNi_{2}B_{2}C, the  effects of SG anisotropy on \rho_{f} can be examined without the complication of other effects.

## II Experiment

Samples were cut from the same single crystal boules used in previous studies. [15, 20] As an impurity, Pt was used instead of Ni. The relevant material parameters are listed in Table 1. The sample with x\!=\!0 is in the moderately clean regime and the impurity-doped samples are in the dirty regime. In order to avoid pinning-related effects, \rho_{f} should be measured at high enough currents or at frequencies higher than the pinning frequency f_{p}. [22] We adopted the latter method to avoid the self-heating of the sample. In nominally pure YNi_{2}B_{2}C, f_{p} is estimated to be below 3 MHz. [23] In other conventional superconductors, f_{p} is at most of the order of 10^{2} MHz. [22] Consequently, pinning-related effects can be avoided completely at microwave frequencies. However, a direct resistivity measurement is difficult at microwave frequencies because of the skin effect. Therefore, we measured the surface impedance Z_{s}\!=\!R_{s}\!+\!iX_{s} using a cavity perturbation method, and calculated the real part of the resistivity \rho_{1} using the relation \rho_{1}\!=\!2R_{s}X_{s}/\mu\omega, where \mu is the permeability and \omega is the angular frequency. Samples were located at the center of a cylindrical Cu cavity which resonate at 44 GHz in the TE_{011} mode. Microwave magnetic fields were applied along the c axis of the crystal to measure the in-plane response. The surface resistance R_{s} and the surface reactance X_{s} were obtained from the changes in the quality factor and the resonance frequency of the cavity, respectively. [24] The absolute value of Z_{s} was determined by a comparison with the dc resistivity \rho above T_{c} assuming the Hagen-Rubens relation R_{s}\!=\!X_{s}\!=\!\sqrt{\mu\omega\rho/2}. This relation can be applied in the local regime where l is much shorter than the skin depth \delta\!=\!\sqrt{2\rho/\mu\omega}. Strictly speaking, the sample with x\!=\!0 is not deep in the local regime since l and \delta were estimated to be of the same order of magnitude. In the nonlocal regime, X_{s} becomes larger than R_{s}, and both R_{s} and X_{s} are larger than the local value. [25] Therefore, the absolute value of Z_{s} for the sample with x\!=\!0 could be somewhat underestimated. In the present study, the absolute value is not crucial to the final conclusion. Samples were cooled down to 0.5 K by a laboratory-made ^{3}He refrigerator. In all the measurements, static magnetic fields were applied along the c axis of the crystals.

## III Results and Discussion

The magnetic field dependence of the surface impedance at 0.5 K for each sample is plotted as a function of \sqrt{H/H_{c2}} in Fig. 1. In the absence of magnetic fields, the response is purely reactive with R_{s}\!\sim\!0 and X_{s}\!=\!\mu\omega\lambda_{0}, where \lambda_{0} is the penetration depth in the Meissner state. We estimate \lambda_{0} to be 500 A for the sample with x\!=\!0. This value is similar to \lambda_{0} obtained by the previous microwave measurement, [16] but is rather short compared to the other estimates. [26] Part of this difference may come from the nonlocality of the response.

In the mixed state, R_{s} and X_{s} increase with increasing H. At high fields, both R_{s} and X_{s} saturate to the value just above T_{c}, which is given by \sqrt{\mu\omega\rho_{res}/2}, where \rho_{res} is the resistivity just above T_{c}. In the sample with x\!=\!0.2, this saturation occurs just at H_{c2} with a clear kink, as expected. However, with decreasing impurity content or increasing SG anisotropy, both R_{s} and X_{s} saturate even below H_{c2} and the kink structure is broadened. This behavior is not caused by the inhomogeneity of the sample, since the broadening is most apparent in the cleanest sample. Therefore, we can conclude that, in clean YNi_{2}B_{2}C, there is a distinct field region below H_{c2} where the QP response is almost as same as that

  in the normal state. In the sample with x\!=\!0, this region extends to about half of H_{e2}. This behavior may be related to the de Haas-van Albhen effect in the mixed state [27] and the large DOS at \epsilon_{F} in the mixed state observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. [28]

Next we try to extract \rho_{f} from R_{s} and X_{s}. In general, Z_{s} in the mixed state consists of several contributions and \rho_{1}, which is directly calculated from Z_{s}, is different from \rho_{f}. Since our measurements were performed at low enough temperatures (T/T_{c}\!<\!0.04), and high enough frequencies (\omega\gg\omega_{p}), contributions from thermally activated QP's and the effects of vortex pinning can be safely neglected. One of the remaining potential contributions is the effect of flux flow. Another important factor that we should consider is the contribution from delocalized QP's. In a superconductor with an isotropic SG, all the QP's in the mixed state are localized in the vortex core. On the other hand, in a strongly anisotropic superconductor, such as nominally pure YNi_{2}B_{2}C, QP's are generated not only in the vortex core, but also _outside_ of the core by the Doppler energy shift from the supercurrent around the vortex. [4] The existence of such delocalized QP's has been confirmed in YNi_{2}B_{2}C by electronic specific heat measurements [15, 16] and in LuNi_{2}B_{2}C by thermal conductivity measurements. [17] To analyze Z_{s} in the mixed state under the influence of the delocalized QP's, we use the formulation of Z_{s} given by Coffey and Clem. [29] If we neglect the effect of vortex pinning, Z_{s} is given by

\[Z_{s}\!=\!i\,\mu\,\omega\lambda_{0}\,\sqrt{\frac{(1-bs)-i(b+s)}{1+s^{2}}},\] (1)

where b\!=\!\rho_{f}/\mu\,\omega\lambda_{0}^{2}, s\!=\!\mu\,\omega\lambda_{0}^{2}\sigma_{nf}, and \sigma_{nf} is the conductivity of the delocalized QP's. Here b and s are measures of the contributions from the flux flow and the delocalized QP's, respectively. If we set s\!=\!0, Eq. (1) is reduced to the pure flux flow state without delocalized QP's and b\!=\!0 denotes the usual two-fluid response without vortices. In the latter case, all the QP's are delocalized as in the case of thermally activated QP's and s\!=\!\omega\,\tau_{nf}\!/t_{nf}/(1-f_{nf}), where \tau_{nf} is the relaxation time of the delocalized QP's and f_{nf} is the normal fluid fraction.

To judge which contribution is dominant in Y(Ni_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}B_{2}C, it is useful to introduce the "impedance plane plot," where X_{s}/X_{s}(0) is plotted against R_{s}/X_{s}(0). [30] Here X_{s}(0)\!=\!\mu\omega\lambda_{0} is a surface reactance in the absence of a magnetic field. This plot is sensitive to the underlying mechanism that dominates Z_{s}. Figure 2 shows the impedance plane plots for Y(Ni_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}B_{2}C. The solid and dashed curves correspond to two limiting cases of Eq. (1), namely, a pure flux flow state (s\!=\!0) and a two-fluid response (b\!=\!0), respectively. As is evident from Fig. 2, the behavior of Z_{s} is reproduced quite well by the assumption of pure flux flow. Small deviation can be seen at high fields where R_{s} and X_{s} are saturated. Consequently, the contribution of delocalized QP's to Z_{s} can be neglected in the field range where R_{s} and X_{s} is field dependent. In other words, in this field range, the real part of the resistivity \rho_{1}, calculated from Z_{s}, can be regarded as \rho_{f} itself.

Figure 3 plots \rho_{1}/\rho_{res} as a function of H/H_{e2}. In the sample with x\!=\!0, in which the SG is strongly anisotropic, \rho_{1}, namely, \rho_{f}, below about a half of H_{e2} is almost proportional to H as in the case of the usual flux flow. However, its slope is twice as large as that expected from the conventional normal core model. [8] We note here that this enhancement is not an artifact caused by the assumption of local electrodynamics. As described above, the absolute value of Z_{s} may be somewhat underestimated. Therefore, a correction for the nonlocal behavior further enhances the anomaly. The enhancement of \rho_{f} implies that the energy dissipation in the vortex core is strongly enhanced in YNi_{2}B_{2}C. In impurity-doped crystals where the anisotropy of the SG is smeared out, this enhancement is reduced except at very low fields, and \rho_{f} approaches the behavior expected in the normal core model. [8] Although the origin of the residual enhancement of

Solid and dashed lines denote the calculated curves in cases of pure flux flow and the two-fluid response, respectively. For the calculation of two-fluid model, we used \omega\tau_{nf}\!=\!0.1. (See the text.) Arrows indicate the direction when H is increased.

  \rho_{f} in impurity-doped crystals is unclear now, the effect of gap anisotropy on \rho_{f} is evident.

It should be noted that such an enhancement of \rho_{f} can_not_ be expected in a clean _isotropic_ superconductor, since \omega_{0}\tau_{c} , which is inversely proportional to \rho_{f}, is always large over the Fermi surface in this case. At very low temperatures, it is theoretically expected that \rho_{f} in a clean superconductor is _reduced_ from the conventional value by a small factor of ln(T_{c}/T) because of the so-called Kramer-Pesch effect,[9, 31] but can never be enhanced. Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed anomaly is not related to the cleanness itself but is caused by the gap anisotropy. Here we emphasize that the anisotropic s-wave superconductivity is realized only in the clean sample.[21]

The observed enhancement factor of 2 is similar to that of UPt_{3} (1.6-4.7).[11, 12] However, unlike in the case of UPt_{3} which has a complicated superconducting order parameter, the enhancement of \rho_{f} in YNi_{2}B_{2}C is solely brought by the SG anisotropy, since YNi_{2}B_{2}C is a "simple" superconductor except for the huge anisotropy of the SG. As mentioned above, \rho_{f} is affected by the SG anisotropy through \omega_{0} and/or \tau_{c} . Future work may examine which path is dominant.

Finally, we briefly comment on the absence of the contribution from delocalized QP's to Z_{s} . If the parameter s is small compared to unity, the effect of delocalized QP's on Z_{s} is small. To evaluate s in the present experiment, we assume that \tau_{nf} in the mixed state is not so different from that in the normal state. If that is the case, \tau_{nf} can be estimated from \rho_{res} . In the sample with x=0, \omega\,\tau_{nf} is estimated to be of the order of 0.1 and is much smaller in the impurity-doped samples. This means that even if the normal fluid fraction f_{nf} becomes 0.5, s\!=\!\omega\,\tau_{nf}f_{nf}/(1\!-\!f_{nf}) is only 0.1 or less. In other words, even at microwave frequencies, one can selectively extract information on the flux flow or the dynamics of the QP's in the vortex core from Z_{s} measurements. This feature is complementary to that of the thermal conductivity measurement which selectively senses the dynamics of delocalized QP's.[17] Considering that the electronic specific heat measures the total QP DOS, combination of these techniques should be important for investigations of the electronic states of the mixed state.

In summary, we measured Z_{s} of the anisotropic s-wave superconductor YNi_{2}B_{2}C to study the effects of SG anisotropy on \rho_{f} . We found that \rho_{f} in the nominally pure sample, in which the SG has a huge anisotropy, is greatly enhanced from that expected from the conventional normal-state vortex core. This enhancement was reduced in impurity-doped samples where the SG anisotropy is smeared out. Such behavior indicates that the quasi-particle relaxation in and around the vortex core is sensitive to the superconducting gap anisotropy. These results imply that \rho_{f} measurement provides useful information for a microscopic understanding of the vortex state of anisotropic superconductors.

###### Abstract

The microwave complex surface impedance Z_{s} of Y(Ni_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}B_{2}C was measured at 0.5 K under magnetic fields H up to 7 T. In nominally pure YNi_{2}B_{2}C, which is a strongly anisotropic s-wave superconductor, the flux flow resistivity \rho_{f} calculated from Z_{s} was twice as large as that expected from the conventional normal-state vortex core model. In Pt-doped samples where the gap anisotropy is smeared out, the enhancement of \rho_{f} is reduced and \rho_{f} approaches the conventional behavior. These results indicate that the energy dissipation in the vortex core is strongly affected by the anisotropy of the superconducting gap.

## I Introduction

In conventional phonon-mediated superconductors, the symmetry of the pair wave function is of s-wave type, and the superconducting gap (SG) is isotropic in momentum space. However, pair wave functions with higher angular momenta are believed to occur in superconductors where strong interactions among electrons play an important role. In such unconventional superconductors, the SG's are anisotropic and can have nodes.[1, 2] In general, even in s-wave superconductors, the SG can be strongly anisotropic.[3]

In superconductors with anisotropic SG's, low-energy quasiparticle (QP) excitations near the gap nodes play an important role. Volovik examined the effects of gap nodes on the QP density of states (DOS) in the mixed state.[4] He pointed out that the QP DOS at the Fermi energy \epsilon_{F} in superconductors with line nodes varies proportionally to \sqrt{H}, in contrast to the case of conventional superconductors with an isotropic SG where the QP DOS at \epsilon_{F} is linear in H, that is, proportional to the number of vortices. Such an enhancement of the QP DOS in anisotropic superconductors has been observed experimentally in d-wave high-T_{c} cuprates[5, 6] and the heavy fermion superconductor UPt_{3} (Ref. [7]) by electronic specific heat measurements.

Besides the QP DOS, gap nodes are expected to affect the flux flow resistivity \rho_{f}. Basically, \rho_{f} is a measure of the QP relaxation _in and around_ the vortex core, and can provide different information from the QP DOS. In dirty superconductors where the QP mean free path l is shorter than the coherence length \xi, the vortex core can be treated as a bulk normal metal with a radius of the order of \xi.[8] As a result, \rho_{f} is simply given by \rho_{f}\sim\rho_{n}/H/H_{c2} regardless of the anisotropy of the SG. In moderately clean superconductors where \xi<l<\xi\epsilon_{F}/\Delta (\Delta is the gap amplitude), however, the vortex core cannot be regarded as a simple normal metal at all, since the QP's are reflected at the edge of the vortex core before they experience impurity scattering. In this regime, \rho_{f} is given by \rho_{f}=H/(ne\langle\omega_{0}\tau_{c}\rangle_{F}).[9] Here n is a carrier density, e is a unit charge, \omega_{0}\sim\Delta^{2}/\epsilon_{F} is the precession frequency of the lowest Andreev bound state,[10]\tau_{c} is the relaxation time in the vortex core, and \langle\cdots\rangle_{F} denotes the average over the Fermi surface. In such a case, nodes in the SG should affect both \omega_{0} and \tau_{c}. First, \omega_{0} in anisotropic superconductors depends on the QP momentum and should be very small near the gap nodes. Second, \tau_{c} can be short because the QP DOS which contributes to the impurity scattering is enhanced in anisotropic superconductors. Both these factors are expected to enhance \rho_{f} from clean isotropic superconductors.

To date, UPt_{3} is the only clean anisotropic superconductor in which \rho_{f} has been measured. The enhancement of \rho_{f} has actually been observed.[11, 12] However, since UPt_{3} is a complicated odd-parity superconductor,[13] it should be noted that many factors other than gap anisotropy can contribute to \rho_{f}. In fact, Lutke-Entrup _et al._ attributed the origin of the \rho_{f} enhancement to the unconventional vortex core structure which is brought by the two-component order parameter.[12] In addition, Kato showed that the parity and chirality of the pair wave function affect \tau_{c} in the moderately clean regime.[14] Therefore, it is still unclear whether \rho_{f} enhancement in UPt_{3} is brought by the gap anisotropy or by the other unconventional nature of superconductivity.

To make clear the effects of gap anisotropy on \rho_{f}, measurement on a _clean, anisotropic, and s-wave_ superconductor is indispensable. From this point of view, we measured the \rho_{f} of Y(Ni_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}B_{2}C. The temperature and magnetic-field dependence of the electronic specific heat,[15, 16] thermal conductivity,[17, 18] and NMR relaxation rate[19] indicate that there are low-lying QP states near \epsilon_{F} even in the superconducting state. This is strong evidence for the huge anisotropy of the SG in YNi_{2}B_{2}C. Recently, Izawa _et al._ suggested, from thermal conductivity measurements under various magnetic field directions that there are point-like gap nodes along the [100] and [010] directions.[18] In addition, it is reported that the introduction of impurities _reduces_ the low-lying QP states and opens the gap all over the Fermi surface with little effect on T_{c}.[15, 20] Such a behavior is totally different from that expected in d- or p-wave superconductors,[21] and provides strong evidence of _anisotropic s-wave_ superconductivity in YNi_{2}B_{2}C. Therefore, by comparing the results in pure (anisotropic) and impurity-doped (isotropic) YNi_{2}B_{2}C, the  effects of SG anisotropy on \rho_{f} can be examined without the complication of other effects.

## II Experiment

Samples were cut from the same single crystal boules used in previous studies. [15, 20] As an impurity, Pt was used instead of Ni. The relevant material parameters are listed in Table 1. The sample with x\!=\!0 is in the moderately clean regime and the impurity-doped samples are in the dirty regime. In order to avoid pinning-related effects, \rho_{f} should be measured at high enough currents or at frequencies higher than the pinning frequency f_{p}. [22] We adopted the latter method to avoid the self-heating of the sample. In nominally pure YNi_{2}B_{2}C, f_{p} is estimated to be below 3 MHz. [23] In other conventional superconductors, f_{p} is at most of the order of 10^{2} MHz. [22] Consequently, pinning-related effects can be avoided completely at microwave frequencies. However, a direct resistivity measurement is difficult at microwave frequencies because of the skin effect. Therefore, we measured the surface impedance Z_{s}\!=\!R_{s}\!+\!iX_{s} using a cavity perturbation method, and calculated the real part of the resistivity \rho_{1} using the relation \rho_{1}\!=\!2R_{s}X_{s}/\mu\omega, where \mu is the permeability and \omega is the angular frequency. Samples were located at the center of a cylindrical Cu cavity which resonate at 44 GHz in the TE_{011} mode. Microwave magnetic fields were applied along the c axis of the crystal to measure the in-plane response. The surface resistance R_{s} and the surface reactance X_{s} were obtained from the changes in the quality factor and the resonance frequency of the cavity, respectively. [24] The absolute value of Z_{s} was determined by a comparison with the dc resistivity \rho above T_{c} assuming the Hagen-Rubens relation R_{s}\!=\!X_{s}\!=\!\sqrt{\mu\omega\rho/2}. This relation can be applied in the local regime where l is much shorter than the skin depth \delta\!=\!\sqrt{2\rho/\mu\omega}. Strictly speaking, the sample with x\!=\!0 is not deep in the local regime since l and \delta were estimated to be of the same order of magnitude. In the nonlocal regime, X_{s} becomes larger than R_{s}, and both R_{s} and X_{s} are larger than the local value. [25] Therefore, the absolute value of Z_{s} for the sample with x\!=\!0 could be somewhat underestimated. In the present study, the absolute value is not crucial to the final conclusion. Samples were cooled down to 0.5 K by a laboratory-made ^{3}He refrigerator. In all the measurements, static magnetic fields were applied along the c axis of the crystals.

## III Results and Discussion

The magnetic field dependence of the surface impedance at 0.5 K for each sample is plotted as a function of \sqrt{H/H_{c2}} in Fig. 1. In the absence of magnetic fields, the response is purely reactive with R_{s}\!\sim\!0 and X_{s}\!=\!\mu\omega\lambda_{0}, where \lambda_{0} is the penetration depth in the Meissner state. We estimate \lambda_{0} to be 500 A for the sample with x\!=\!0. This value is similar to \lambda_{0} obtained by the previous microwave measurement, [16] but is rather short compared to the other estimates. [26] Part of this difference may come from the nonlocality of the response.

In the mixed state, R_{s} and X_{s} increase with increasing H. At high fields, both R_{s} and X_{s} saturate to the value just above T_{c}, which is given by \sqrt{\mu\omega\rho_{res}/2}, where \rho_{res} is the resistivity just above T_{c}. In the sample with x\!=\!0.2, this saturation occurs just at H_{c2} with a clear kink, as expected. However, with decreasing impurity content or increasing SG anisotropy, both R_{s} and X_{s} saturate even below H_{c2} and the kink structure is broadened. This behavior is not caused by the inhomogeneity of the sample, since the broadening is most apparent in the cleanest sample. Therefore, we can conclude that, in clean YNi_{2}B_{2}C, there is a distinct field region below H_{c2} where the QP response is almost as same as that

  in the normal state. In the sample with x\!=\!0, this region extends to about half of H_{e2}. This behavior may be related to the de Haas-van Albhen effect in the mixed state [27] and the large DOS at \epsilon_{F} in the mixed state observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. [28]

Next we try to extract \rho_{f} from R_{s} and X_{s}. In general, Z_{s} in the mixed state consists of several contributions and \rho_{1}, which is directly calculated from Z_{s}, is different from \rho_{f}. Since our measurements were performed at low enough temperatures (T/T_{c}\!<\!0.04), and high enough frequencies (\omega\gg\omega_{p}), contributions from thermally activated QP's and the effects of vortex pinning can be safely neglected. One of the remaining potential contributions is the effect of flux flow. Another important factor that we should consider is the contribution from delocalized QP's. In a superconductor with an isotropic SG, all the QP's in the mixed state are localized in the vortex core. On the other hand, in a strongly anisotropic superconductor, such as nominally pure YNi_{2}B_{2}C, QP's are generated not only in the vortex core, but also _outside_ of the core by the Doppler energy shift from the supercurrent around the vortex. [4] The existence of such delocalized QP's has been confirmed in YNi_{2}B_{2}C by electronic specific heat measurements [15, 16] and in LuNi_{2}B_{2}C by thermal conductivity measurements. [17] To analyze Z_{s} in the mixed state under the influence of the delocalized QP's, we use the formulation of Z_{s} given by Coffey and Clem. [29] If we neglect the effect of vortex pinning, Z_{s} is given by

\[Z_{s}\!=\!i\,\mu\,\omega\lambda_{0}\,\sqrt{\frac{(1-bs)-i(b+s)}{1+s^{2}}},\] (1)

where b\!=\!\rho_{f}/\mu\,\omega\lambda_{0}^{2}, s\!=\!\mu\,\omega\lambda_{0}^{2}\sigma_{nf}, and \sigma_{nf} is the conductivity of the delocalized QP's. Here b and s are measures of the contributions from the flux flow and the delocalized QP's, respectively. If we set s\!=\!0, Eq. (1) is reduced to the pure flux flow state without delocalized QP's and b\!=\!0 denotes the usual two-fluid response without vortices. In the latter case, all the QP's are delocalized as in the case of thermally activated QP's and s\!=\!\omega\,\tau_{nf}\!/t_{nf}/(1-f_{nf}), where \tau_{nf} is the relaxation time of the delocalized QP's and f_{nf} is the normal fluid fraction.

To judge which contribution is dominant in Y(Ni_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}B_{2}C, it is useful to introduce the "impedance plane plot," where X_{s}/X_{s}(0) is plotted against R_{s}/X_{s}(0). [30] Here X_{s}(0)\!=\!\mu\omega\lambda_{0} is a surface reactance in the absence of a magnetic field. This plot is sensitive to the underlying mechanism that dominates Z_{s}. Figure 2 shows the impedance plane plots for Y(Ni_{1-x}Pt_{x})_{2}B_{2}C. The solid and dashed curves correspond to two limiting cases of Eq. (1), namely, a pure flux flow state (s\!=\!0) and a two-fluid response (b\!=\!0), respectively. As is evident from Fig. 2, the behavior of Z_{s} is reproduced quite well by the assumption of pure flux flow. Small deviation can be seen at high fields where R_{s} and X_{s} are saturated. Consequently, the contribution of delocalized QP's to Z_{s} can be neglected in the field range where R_{s} and X_{s} is field dependent. In other words, in this field range, the real part of the resistivity \rho_{1}, calculated from Z_{s}, can be regarded as \rho_{f} itself.

Figure 3 plots \rho_{1}/\rho_{res} as a function of H/H_{e2}. In the sample with x\!=\!0, in which the SG is strongly anisotropic, \rho_{1}, namely, \rho_{f}, below about a half of H_{e2} is almost proportional to H as in the case of the usual flux flow. However, its slope is twice as large as that expected from the conventional normal core model. [8] We note here that this enhancement is not an artifact caused by the assumption of local electrodynamics. As described above, the absolute value of Z_{s} may be somewhat underestimated. Therefore, a correction for the nonlocal behavior further enhances the anomaly. The enhancement of \rho_{f} implies that the energy dissipation in the vortex core is strongly enhanced in YNi_{2}B_{2}C. In impurity-doped crystals where the anisotropy of the SG is smeared out, this enhancement is reduced except at very low fields, and \rho_{f} approaches the behavior expected in the normal core model. [8] Although the origin of the residual enhancement of

Solid and dashed lines denote the calculated curves in cases of pure flux flow and the two-fluid response, respectively. For the calculation of two-fluid model, we used \omega\tau_{nf}\!=\!0.1. (See the text.) Arrows indicate the direction when H is increased.

  \rho_{f} in impurity-doped crystals is unclear now, the effect of gap anisotropy on \rho_{f} is evident.

It should be noted that such an enhancement of \rho_{f} can_not_ be expected in a clean _isotropic_ superconductor, since \omega_{0}\tau_{c} , which is inversely proportional to \rho_{f}, is always large over the Fermi surface in this case. At very low temperatures, it is theoretically expected that \rho_{f} in a clean superconductor is _reduced_ from the conventional value by a small factor of ln(T_{c}/T) because of the so-called Kramer-Pesch effect,[9, 31] but can never be enhanced. Therefore, we can safely conclude that the observed anomaly is not related to the cleanness itself but is caused by the gap anisotropy. Here we emphasize that the anisotropic s-wave superconductivity is realized only in the clean sample.[21]

The observed enhancement factor of 2 is similar to that of UPt_{3} (1.6-4.7).[11, 12] However, unlike in the case of UPt_{3} which has a complicated superconducting order parameter, the enhancement of \rho_{f} in YNi_{2}B_{2}C is solely brought by the SG anisotropy, since YNi_{2}B_{2}C is a "simple" superconductor except for the huge anisotropy of the SG. As mentioned above, \rho_{f} is affected by the SG anisotropy through \omega_{0} and/or \tau_{c} . Future work may examine which path is dominant.

Finally, we briefly comment on the absence of the contribution from delocalized QP's to Z_{s} . If the parameter s is small compared to unity, the effect of delocalized QP's on Z_{s} is small. To evaluate s in the present experiment, we assume that \tau_{nf} in the mixed state is not so different from that in the normal state. If that is the case, \tau_{nf} can be estimated from \rho_{res} . In the sample with x=0, \omega\,\tau_{nf} is estimated to be of the order of 0.1 and is much smaller in the impurity-doped samples. This means that even if the normal fluid fraction f_{nf} becomes 0.5, s\!=\!\omega\,\tau_{nf}f_{nf}/(1\!-\!f_{nf}) is only 0.1 or less. In other words, even at microwave frequencies, one can selectively extract information on the flux flow or the dynamics of the QP's in the vortex core from Z_{s} measurements. This feature is complementary to that of the thermal conductivity measurement which selectively senses the dynamics of delocalized QP's.[17] Considering that the electronic specific heat measures the total QP DOS, combination of these techniques should be important for investigations of the electronic states of the mixed state.

In summary, we measured Z_{s} of the anisotropic s-wave superconductor YNi_{2}B_{2}C to study the effects of SG anisotropy on \rho_{f} . We found that \rho_{f} in the nominally pure sample, in which the SG has a huge anisotropy, is greatly enhanced from that expected from the conventional normal-state vortex core. This enhancement was reduced in impurity-doped samples where the SG anisotropy is smeared out. Such behavior indicates that the quasi-particle relaxation in and around the vortex core is sensitive to the superconducting gap anisotropy. These results imply that \rho_{f} measurement provides useful information for a microscopic understanding of the vortex state of anisotropic superconductors.
