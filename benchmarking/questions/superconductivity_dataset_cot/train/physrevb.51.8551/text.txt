###### Abstract

Studies of the magnetization of the polycrystalline Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr2Ca2Cu3O10 superconductor revealed substantial changes in several properties, arising from moderate levels of damage from neutron irradiation. In addition to the expected increases in current density (as evidenced by increased magnetic hysteresis), analysis of the equilibrium magnetization revealed significant increases in several more fundamental properties, including the upper critical magnetic field \(H_{c2}\) and the London penetration depth \(\lambda_{ab}\); these increased by 30 and 15 %, respectively, following irradiation with 0.8 x 1017 n/cm2, with still larger increases at a higher fluence. However, the most intrinsic properties, specifically the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\) and the superconductive condensation energy \(F_{c}\), were unchanged at the highest neutron fluence used, 2.4 x 1017 n/cm2. We attribute the changes in fundamental properties to mean-free-path effects, via increased scattering of conduction electrons.

## Introduction

Magnetic studies have been widely used to investigate the properties of high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) materials.1 For example, in the mixed state, the intragrain persistent current density \(J_{p}(T,H)\) can be found from the _irreversible_ magnetization using the critical state (Bean) model. From the _reversible_ (equilibrium) magnetization \(M(H,T)\), several groups have obtained the London penetration depth \(\lambda(T)\) using the London-limit formalism of Kogan, Fang, and Mitra.2 More recent theoretical developments (Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan,3 Kogan _et al._4), have shown that vortex _fluctuations_ are important in regions of magnetic field and temperature above the irreversibility line, where vortices are free in principle to move to their equilibrium locations. In particular, the entropy associated with fluctuations introduces a correction to the equilibrium free energy, which modifies the equilibrium magnetization. These modifications are most significant for highly anisotropic, layered materials, and near the superconductive transition temperature \(T_{c}\). The fluctuation analysis is a useful tool for determining the characteristic magnetic fields and lengths, as well as giving estimates of the superconducting volume fraction of the material. Cho _et al._5 showed that this formalism still applies to random polycrystals, if the material is sufficiently anisotropic that only the component of the applied field \(H\) perpendicular to the layers is effective. Further below \(T_{c}\), where fluctuation effects are less significant, the theory of Hao-Clem6 provides an alternative formulation for determining the fundamental properties of the superconductor from studies of the reversible magnetization in the intermediate field region.7

The main objective in this work is to assess the impact of neutron-generated damage on the equilibrium properties of a specific HTSC material. Recent theoretical developments, cited above, provide useful methods for quantifying the characteristic lengths and fields, such as \(H_{c2}\) and \(\lambda_{ab}\). We have used fast neutron irradiation to modify the Bi-based superconductor Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr2Ca2Cu3O10, which for moderate fluences creates defects in high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors in the form of collision cascades and pointlike defects.8-10 It appears that the localized damage affects the superconductor in two ways that may be related: (1) it shortens the mean free path for conduction electrons by providing scattering centers, and (2) it increases the (critical and persistent) current density in the material, by increased vortex pinning. Here we study primarily the impact of the mean free path on the equilibrium properties, as there is little information to date regarding these effects in high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors.

## Experimental aspects

The subject of this study, the Bi1.8Pb0.3Sr2Ca2Cu3O10 (hereafter BiPb-2223) compound, contains three adjacent CuO layers and is a highly anisotropic superconductor.

 The sample was polycrystalline and sintered. As formed, its diamagnetic onset transition temperature \(T_{c}\) was 109 K, measured at low magnetic field (<=4-10 Oe). The aggregate morphology consisted of randomly orient-ed, thin platelet structures with edge dimensions of 100 _m_m. Two pieces cut from the same larger disk were used for comparison; one (mass =169 mg) was irradiated with fast neutrons (_E_ > 0.1 MeV) at the MIT Research Reactor to increase the density of scattering centers and vortex-pinning sites. The sample was mounted in a polyurethane vial and container. There was no Cd shielding (which is sometimes used to absorb thermal neutrons), due to its excessive heat generation. The sample was cooled by forced air flow, giving an estimated temperature during irradiation of <70 degC. The energy spectrum of fission neutrons has a peak near 1 MeV and extends to ~10 MeV.

A neutron fluence _ph_ = 0.8 x 1017 n/cm2 led to a three-fold increase of irreversible magnetization \(M\) (_H_, _T_), i.e., increase in the current density for temperatures in the range 5-20 K for all fields. After a total fluence of 2.4 x 1017 n/cm2, the corresponding enhancements of \(J_{p}\) relative to the unirradiated material were factors of 4-6 in the same temperature range. A more complete discussion of enhancements in current density via irradiation of Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O and other materials can be found in a recent review.11 A second piece (mass = 85 mg) was left unirradiated for more extensive measurements of the equilibrium magnetization. When unirradiated, the two portions had identical properties, including clear evidence of vortex fluctuation effects in an interval a few K around the low-field \(T_{c}\).

The magnetic experiments were performed in a multipurpose SQUID- (superconducting quantum interference device) -based magnetometer. Measurements were conducted under identical conditions, using a magnetometer scan length of 2-3 cm, for fixed temperature settings ranging from 40 to 108 K. Before each isothermal measurement, the sample was brought to a temperature well above \(T_{c}\) and then cooled in zero applied field. Once the temperature was stabilized, the magnetic moment "_m_" was measured at various applied magnetic fields \(H\), increasing from 0.01 to 6.5 T and decreasing back to 0.01 T. To correct for the magnetic moment of the sample holder and any foreign materials, the normal-state magnetic susceptibility was measured for temperatures up to 250 K. It was practically constant, showing no signs of Curie or Curie-Weiss behavior. After correction for the background, the equilibrium (reversible) magnetic moment was determined as the mean value between field-increasing and field-decreasing measurements. In most of the experimental range, however, both signals coincided since the \(T\),_H_ settings were mostly in the reversible region above the irreversibility line of the magnetic phase diagram.

The equilibrium magnetization \(M\) (_T_,_H_) of the sample was calculated as the reversible magnetic moment per unit of superconducting volume. The determination of the superconducting volume of a sample, however, is nontrivial. Traditionally, the total volume _V_tot has been obtained by simply dividing the total mass of the sample by the x-ray density (in our case, 6.4 [g/cm3]). This procedure assumes that all of the BiPb-2223 material is superconducting. The fluctuation analysis indicates, however, that only a fraction of the total volume, the volume ratio "_e_" = _V_SC/_V_tot, is superconducting. According to the theory outlined below, the volume ratio can be obtained from a specific experimental feature, the field independent magnetization _M_* that occurs at the characteristic temperature _T_*. The experimental quantities _M_*expt(=_m_*/_V_tot) and _T_* are directly observed as a "crossing point" of various \(M\) (_T_,_H_) lines, as shown in Fig. 1. On the other hand, the theory provides that _M_*calc = _k__B__T_*/_ph_  factor \(e\), with 0 < \(e\) < 1, so that the observed and calculated values of _M_* coincide. In the present work, \(e\) ranged from ~0.31 for the virgin sample to ~0.45, see Table I.

## Theoretical framework

Assuming only static interactions between vortices, standard London-limit theory2 predicts a logarithmic field dependence \(M\)   ln(_H_), where \(M\) is the mixed-state reversible magnetization. More recently, Bulaevskii, Ledvij, and Kogan3 and Kogan _et al._,4 have shown that vortex fluctuations contribute to the free energy, due to entropic effects. This modifies the simple London relation by introducing a correction term. With fluctuations included and assuming the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the CuO layers, one has

\[\frac{\partial M_{0}}{\partial\ln(H)} = \frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)}\left[ {1 - g(T)} \right]\]

, where

\[g(T) = 32\pi^{2}k_{B}T\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)/(\phi_{0}^{2})\]

The quantity \(M\)0 is the magnetization of a single crystal (or equivalent) with \(H\) 1(layers); \(l_{b}\) is the magnetic penetration depth corresponding to screening by supercurrents in the _ab_ planes; and \(s\) is the interlayer spacing. For BiPb-2223 containing trilayers of three adjacent CuO sheets, we take \(s\) to be the separation of trilayers sets, 1.8 nm. Note that at a characteristic temperature _T_* < \(T_{c}\), one has \(g\) (_T_*) = 1; consequently \(M\) is independent of field and has the value _M_* = _k__B__T__*/_ph__s_. The field independence of the mixed-state magnetization at temperature _T_* is an important feature of vortex fluctuation theory as well as nonperturbative scaling theory.12-14 The results just outlined are valid for temperatures below and approaching ~_T_*, near which the correction term markedly affects the deduced values of \(l_{b}\)(_T_). The free-energy expression leads to the relation

\[\ln \frac{\eta H_{e2}}{eH} = \left[ {- 32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}\frac{M_{0}}{\phi_{0}} + g\ln \frac{g}{e}} \right]\frac{1}{1 - g}\]

, where \(e\) = 2.718 ... and the factor \(e\)  1.4 is given by Hao-Clem theory.6 Equation (3) provides a way for

  evaluating the upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\), since all the other quantities are obtained from the preceding analysis.

To this point, the theoretical expressions pertain to the case that \(H\)(layers), as with a single crystal. According to Cho _et al._, 5 these results still apply to a random polycrystal, provided the material is sufficiently anisotropic that only the component of \(H\) perpendicular to the layers is effective.15 Then the magnetization \(M\) of a polycrystal is

\[M_{s} = M_{0}\left\langle \cos\theta \right\rangle + \left\langle \cos\theta \ln\left( \cos\theta \right) \right\rangle\frac{\phi_{0}}{32\pi^{2}\lambda_{ab}^{2}}\left( 1 - g \right)\,.\]

The brackets \(\langle\,\cdots\,\rangle\) denote an angular average with weighting factor sin\(\theta\). For random crystallites, one has \(\langle\cos\theta \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\); \(\langle\cos\theta \ln\cos\theta \rangle = - \frac{1}{4}\); \(M^{\star} = \frac{1}{2}M_{0}^{\star}\); and \(\langle\partial M/\partial\ln H \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\langle\partial M_{0}/\partial\ln H \rangle\). In this work we have used Eqs. (1)-(4) and the weighted angular averages to obtain \(\lambda_{ab}\), \(H_{c2}\), and related properties.

To complement the fluctuation analysis, the HaemClem6 (HC) formalism was also used to ascertain the effect of neutron irradiation on the superconductor. For internal consistency, the magnetization data were scaled by the volume ratio \(\epsilon\) deduced above. The HC treatment provides values for the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \(\kappa(T) \equiv \lambda/\xi\) and the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}(T)\). The product of these two gives \(H_{c2}(T) = \kappa(T)H_{c}(T)\sqrt{2}\). Also \(\lambda(T)\), \(\xi(T)\), and \(H_{c1}(T)\) can be obtained from the usual GL expressions. Implementing the formalism, however, is not simple, as has been described in detail elsewhere.7 Generally \(H_{c}(T)\) is relatively well defined (within 3-5 %), while values for \(\kappa\) are less sharply defined (typically within 5-10 %). Consequently the estimates of the upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\) have uncertainties of 8-15 %. Once values for \(H_{c}(T)\) were determined, \(H_{c}(0)\) at \(T = 0\) was obtained using the BCS temperature dependence16 for this quantity. On the other hand, we construct the \(H_{c2}(T)\) line near \(T_{c}\) from \(H_{c}(T)\) and \(\kappa\), and extrapolate \(H_{c2}\) to the horizontal axis to define \(T_{c,H}\). Finally, the value of \(H_{c2}(0)\) at \(T = 0\) was obtained from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) relation of Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg,17\(H_{c2}(0) = 0.7T_{c,H}( - dH_{c2}/dT)\). The different extrapolation procedures for \(H_{c}\) and \(H_{c2}\) are consistent with the fact that the GL parameter \(\kappa\) is temperature dependent.

The third theoretical model used in this work is the two-dimensional scaling theory.12-14 Assuming a two-dimensional (2D) model for the superconducting transition, the theory predicts that the temperature and field dependence of physical quantities should scale in the variable \(t_{G} = \Xi\left[ T - T_{c}(H) \right]/\left( TH \right)^{1/2}\), where \(\Xi\) is a field- and temperature-independent function and the exponent \(\frac{1}{2}\) refers specifically to the 2D case. If \(M/\left( TH \right)^{1/2}\) is plotted versus \(t_{G}\), then all \(M\left( T, H \right)\) curves should collapse onto a single curve, independent of \(H\). For this analysis near \(T_{c}\), the quantity \(T_{c}(H)\) can be taken as a straight line with slope \(dH_{c2}/dT\) and intercept \(T_{c0}\). Scaling to form a universal curve then provides experimental values of \(T_{c0}\) and \(H_{c2}(T)\).

## Results

Figure 1 shows the high-temperature, equilibrium magnetization \(M(T;H)\) for the virgin and neutron-damaged BiPb-223 materials. The various curves denote data for a wide range of magnetic fields, 0.01\(-\)6.5 T. Figures 1(a)\(-\)1(c) demonstrate the characteristic field independence of the magnetization at temperatures \(T^{\star} \approx 106\)-102 K for the respective cases. The corresponding magnetization \(M^{\star}\) (based on the total volume \(V_{\rm tot}\)) at the crossing point is \(-\)0.12 to \(-\)0.17 G; see Table I for specific values. Note that the fluctuation magnetization in the mixed state persists to temperatures _above_ the low field diamagnetic onset \(T_{c}\) of these materials.

Equation (1) predicts a logarithmic dependence of \(M \propto \ln H\) on field \(H\). Semilogarithmic plots of \(M\) versus \(\ln(H)\) at fixed temperatures showed that the data followed this dependence accurately for nearly all temperatures.18 At the lowest temperatures, some curvature in the semilogarithmic plots developed,19 as expected; we have excluded these data from the present analysis, which emphasizes the effect of scattering and mean free path on equilibrium superconducting properties. The overall logarithmic field dependence and particularly the presence of the crossing point with field-independent magnetization at \(T^{\star}\) are clear indicators of the presence of vortex fluctuations.

To determine the penetration depth \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\), we obtained logarithmic slopes \(\partial M/\partial\ln H\) as described. Analysis using Eqs. (1) and (2) with appropriate angular and volumetric factors "\(e\)" leads directly to \(\lambda_{ab}\) for each isotherm. The results for the virgin and irradiated materials are summarized in Fig. 2 as plots of \(1/\lambda_{ab}^{2}(T)\) versus \(T\). For each case, the solid and dashed lines show the BCS temperature dependencies in the clean and dirty limits, respectively. Points at \(T > T^{\star}\), which lie outside of the range of validity of the theory, are plotted for illustration, but were excluded from the fit. From fitting the BCS forms, we extrapolate to obtain \(\lambda_{ab}(0)\) and the _mean-field_ transition temperature \(T_{c0,\lambda}\) at which (\(1/\lambda^{2}\)

  goes to 0, for the clean and dirty limits; see Table I. At all levels of neutron damage, _T_c0,\(l\) lies several K _above_ the low field diamagnetic onset \(T_{c}\). This is another characteristic feature of the vortex fluctuation theory. The most important result of this analysis, however, is the _systematic increase_ in the magnetic penetration depth \(l_{b}\) with neutron fluence, i.e., damage density. The detailed dependence on fluence will be examined in the discussion section.

The Bulaevskii-Kogan formalism also provides information on _H__c_2 at elevated temperatures. So far, we have experimental values for all quantities (_l_,\(g\),_M_0, etc.) in Eq. (3), except _H__c_2. By plotting the right side of this equation versus ln_H_ and extrapolating the resulting linear dependence to the horizontal axis, we can obtain _H__c_2(_T_) to logarithmic accuracy from the intercept. Figure 3(a) shows experimental results for _H__c_2(_T_) for the virgin and irradiated BiPb-2223 materials. The straight lines in the figure are fitted to the data near but below ~_T_*, where the theory is valid. The lines illustrate the linear WHH temperature dependence in the theory of Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg.17 Note that the slope _dH__c_2/_dT_ (_H_|_c_ axis) systematically increases with neutron fluence. Using the WHH relation _H__c_2(0)=-0.7x(_dH__c_2/_dT_)_T__c_0 gives values for _H__c_2(0) increasing from ~200 to 450 T. From these results, we compute the _ab_-plane coherence lengths \(x_{b}\)(0) from the standard Ginzburg-Landau relation _H__c_2=_ph_0/2\(p\)5_ab_ =21/2_p_K_H__c_. This shows that \(x_{b}\)(0) decreases from 12.8 to 11.4 to 8.5 A, respectively; i.e., an overall reduction of about 34%.

In light of these marked changes, it is very instructive to examine the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\)(0)=_ph_0/23/2\(p\)5_ab_ab_, since it is intimately related to the fundamental energetics of the superconductor. As shown in Table I, the values obtained for this quantity are very similar, \(H_{c}\)(0)  1.3 T, for the virgin and both irradiated samples. Thus the condensation energy _H__c_2/_8\(p\) was not altered by radiation damage, which is consistent with the small change in \(T_{c}\) (+-2%) and the fact that it is an intrinsic thermodynamic property.

Figure 3(b) compares the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(k_{c}\) = _l__ab_/_ph_ab_ for the three samples. As expected, the experimental values of \(k\) are nearly temperature independent. For each sample, Table I lists the average value of \(k\) for the temperature range 50-102 K. The progressive increase of \(k\) with neutron fluence _ph_ is consistent with the observed increase in _H__c_2 and constancy of the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\). In contrast with the nominal temperature independence of \(k\) seen in Fig. 3(b), the values obtained from any analysis neglecting fluctuation effects (_g_ =0) are unphysical near _T_*, with \(k\) tending to diverge as \(T\) increases.

The fluctuation analysis gives evidence that irradiation-generated disorder produces remarkable changes in many superconducting properties. To corroborate these findings, we used the independent Hao-Clem6 formalism to reanalyze the background-corrected, equilibrium magnetization data for all samples. Since this technique neglects thermal fluctuations of vortices, the results near \(T_{c}\) are not reliable; hence we concentrate on the lower temperature range from 60 to ~90 K. Also, we base the magnetization on the superconducting volume of each sample, as obtained from the fluctuation analysis, to facilitate numerical comparison. The resulting values are tabulated in Table I. The results confirm the significant increases of \(k\) and the _H__c_2 slope due to irradiation damage. Consistent with our previous finding, the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\)(0)=1.7 T was unchanged by the first irradiation with 0.8x1017 n/cm2. For unknown reasons, the numerical solutions to the Hao-Clem equations converged poorly for the higher fluence sample, with excessive interaction between the trial values of \(k\) and \(H_{c}\). To proceed with this analysis, we set \(H_{c}\)  1.7 T as obtained for the lower irradiation levels; this plausible assumption is consistent with the results of the fluctuation analysis. The resulting values for this irradiation level are shown in the Hao-Clem section of Table I.

We now consider a third analytical approach, a scaling analysis. According to the theory outlined above, a plot of _M_(_H_,_T_)/(_TH_)_* versus [_T_ - \(T_{c}\)(_H_)]/(_TH_)_* should collapse onto a single curve; for 2D scaling as is appropriate for highly layered materials, the exponent \(n\) = 1/2. The temperature \(T_{c}\)(_H_) can be taken as a linear function of temperature, with slope _dH__c_2/_dT_ and intercept _T__c_0 on the \(T\) axis. Adjusting these parameters yielded the scaling illustrated in Fig. 4. The figure includes results for

Figure 3: The dependence on temperature of (a) the upper critical magnetic field _H__c_2 (_H_|_c_ axes) and (b) the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(k\) = (_l__ab_/_ph_ab_) for virgin and neutron-irradiated BiPb-2223. As for Fig. 2, a fluctuation analysis was used. Note that _H__c_2 varies approximately linear with temperature near \(T_{c}\), while \(k\) is nearly constant, as expected.

  both the virgin sample and the sample irradiated with 2.4 x 1017 n/cm2. The respective parameter values are \(n\) = 0.50, _T_c0 = 109 K, and slope = -4 T/K for the virgin sample, compared with \(n\) = 0.51 and 106 K, and -6 T/K for the more heavily irradiated sample. For clarity, the results for the intermediate irradiation are not shown in the figure. However, the data overlay those shown, with parameter values \(n\) = 0.51 and 107.8 K, and slope -5 T/K. These results again point to significant increases in _H__c_2 upon irradiation.

In addition to the documented changes in the characteristic fields and lengths generated by irradiation, we find that the irreversibility line _B_itr(_T_) increases notably with neutron damage. This line in the _B_-_T_ phase diagram defines two regions, one at low temperatures with a finite persistent current density \(J_{p}\) and a second at higher temperatures with immeasurably small \(J_{p}\). Experimental results are shown in Fig. 5. While the nature and origin of this line continue to be highly controversial, particularly in the presence of disorder, we concern ourselves here with establishing the changes in _B_itr associated with neutron-generated defects. Experimentally, we obtained values for _B_itr from plots of the pinning force density _J__p__H_ versus field \(H_{i}\), for fixed temperature \(T\). As the field \(H\) increases from zero, the pinning force increases, passes through a peak, then decreases nearly _linearly_, and finally approaches the horizontal axis asymptotically. We extrapolate the characteristic linear decrease to the axis, where _J__p__H_ = 0, and use the intercept to demarcate _B_itr. Operationally, this procedure is often better defined than the alternative procedure of trying to find the point at which the hysteresis \(\Delta M \propto J_{p}\) in a magnetization curve disappears. Applying the same procedure to the virgin and irradiated materials gives values for _B_itr(_T_) that generally increase with neutron fluence.

For comparison, Fig. 5 includes other measurements of the irreversibility line in this compound.20,21 The data of Li _et al._21 correspond to unirradiated aligned powder of transverse dimension ~10 _m_m. Also shown are measurements of Civale _et al._20 on textured BiPb-2223/Ag tape, both as prepared and irradiated with 1-GeV Au ions to form columnar defects. The irreversibility fields for all the unirradiated materials are roughly consistent, although some dependence on sample dimension has been demonstrated.21 With neutron irradiation, _B_itr steadily increased, as observed22 previously in single crystals of Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2O8. This is likely due to increased vortex pinning from collision cascades and associated defects. The highest irreversibility line belongs to material with columnar defects, which provide the most effective vortex pinning sites known. Indeed, quite substantial expansions of the irreversible region have been demonstrated for the sister compound Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2O8, both with aligned columnar defect23,24 and with randomly oriented (splayed) columnar defects produced by GeV energy protons.25 For the BiPb-2223 material, then, the irreversibility field progresses systematically: it is lowest in unirradiated materials with only naturally occurring defects; it increases with the density of neutron-generated damage; and it is highest in the presence of columnar defects.

## Discussion

This work has established that several of the characteristic fields and lengths of BiPb-2223 superconductor are substantially modified by neutron-irradiation-induced damage. Using three independent theoretical models, we observe consistent trends with neutron fluence, specifically increases in the upper critical magnetic field _H__c_2(0) and the London penetration depth \(l\). The fluctuation analysis indicates that the slope of _H__c_2 and its calculated value at zero increase by factors of 1.3 and 2.3 relative to the unirradiated material, for respective fluences of 0.8 and 2.4 x 1017 neutrons/cm2. The Hao-Clem analysis yielded similar factors of 1.46 and 2.4 for the

Figure 4: Scaling analysis of the experiment magnetization for a 2D superconductor. The results properly collapse onto a single “universal” curve, using the critical field slopes and parameter values shown in Table 1. The temperature interval treated is 100 – 106 K for the virgin sample and 96 – 104 K for the sample irradiated with 2.4 × 1017 n/cm2. Measurements for the intermediate fluence of 0.8 × 1017 are very similar, but for clarity are not shown.

For comparison, the figure includes results for aligned grains of BiPb-2223 (Ref. 21) and for textured tape with and without columnar defects (Ref. 20).

  corresponding cases. Also, 2D scaling yielded increases in _H__c_2 slope of 1.25 and 1.5 for the respective irradiations. The penetration depth increased significantly for the two fluences, by 10 and 45 % relative to the virgin material.

This work shows that localized neutron damage causes substantial changes in the equilibrium properties of this high-_T__c_ superconductor. Three different analyses all point to changes in _H__c_2 by similar factors. In comparing results from the three methods, we focus on relative changes. It is perhaps not surprising that the numerical values from the different analyses differ, which can arise from dissimilar angular averages in the polycrystalline material. However, (portions of) the same polycrystal was used throughout the study, so any theory-specific angular average should be the same for all fluences, i.e., each specific analysis is internally consistent. In contrast with _H__c_2 and \(l\), the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\) did _not_ change appreciably, but remained remarkably constant. This provides an important check on the study, for it should not change: with moderate levels of neutron damage and a slight depression of the low field \(T_{c}\) from 109 to 107 K, one expects only negligible changes in the average order parameter and in the condensation energy.

What microscopic phenomenon can explain the clearly documented increases in _H__c_2 and London penetration _l_? A likely mechanism is a reduction in the electronic mean free path due to irradiation damage. Monte Carlo calculations and transmission electron microscopy studies [8, 9] of other high-_T__c_ materials with moderate levels of neutron damage show the formation of collision cascades, which will be accompanied by pointlike defects. Certainly such defects produce electronic scattering, a reduced mean free path, and increased intragrain electrical resistivity \(r\) in the normal state. For 3D superconductors, there is a well-developed theory predicting that the slope of _H__c_2 increases as the mean free path decreases.[26] This theory has been supported by experiments [26] on three-dimensional superconductors, such as the \(A\) 15 materials V3Si and Nb3Sn. Unfortunately, no corresponding theory for highly anisotropic superconductors exists, and intergranular electrical resistance in our polycrystalline BiPb-2223 precluded meaningful measurement of the intragrain resistivity. Moreover, it is likely that defects in this layered, 2D material affect the electronic system more strongly than for 3D materials, since there is less phase space for conduction electrons to scatter into.

Recognizing the limitations just listed, we now apply the available 3D theory to the current results. A convenient tabulation of theoretical relations has been given by Orlando _et al._, [26] whose notation we use in the following. For example, one has

\[H_{c} = 4.23\gamma^{1/2}T_{c}(1 - t)\ ,\]

where \(t\) = _T_/_T__c_ is the reduced temperature, \(g\) is the coefficient of the linear electronic heat capacity, magnetic fields are measured in Oe, and all lengths are measured in cm. With the measured value of \(H_{c}\), this relation predicts \(g\)  900 erg/cm3 K2. This estimate compares reasonably with the value \(g\) BCS ~ 600 erg/cm3 K2 for BiPb-2223 deduced by Schnelle _et al._[27] from the jump in specific heat near \(T_{c}\). Considering the slope of _H__c_2 near \(T_{c}\), we assume that the clean limit applies for the virgin sample, since \(x_{b}\) is short. In this limit, the 3D theory provides that

\[-dH_{c2}/dT = 9.55 \times 10^{24}\gamma^{2}T_{c}(n^{2/3}S/S_{F})^{-2}\ ,\]

where \(n\) is the density of conduction electrons, \(S\) is the Fermi-surface area, and \(S_{F}\) is the Fermi-surface area for a free-electron gas of density \(n\). Using the measured slope of _H__c_2, -2.6 x 104 G/K, one finds (_n_2/_S_/_S__F_) ~ 2 x 104/cm2; setting _S_/_S__F_ = 1 gives the crude estimate that \(n\) ~ 2 x 1021 cm-3, which is not unreasonable. The London penetration depth \(l\) gives a consistency check through the relation

\[\lambda(T = 0) = 1.33 \times 10^{8}\gamma^{1/2}(n^{2/3}S/S_{F})^{-1}\ .\]

This gives the value \(l\) ~ 220 nm, which compares reasonably with the measurement of \(l\) = 139 nm.

After irradiation, the mean free path \(l\) is shorter. Then it is appropriate to use the full expression for the slope of _H__c_2:

\[-dH_{c2}/dT = [ 9.55 \times 10^{24}\gamma^{2}T_{c}(n^{2/3}S/S_{F})^{-2} + 6.67 \times 10^{8}\gamma(1/l_{\rm tr})(n^{2/3}S/S_{F})^{-1}\ ]\ ,\]

\[-dH_{c2}/dT = [ 9.55 \times 10^{24}\gamma^{2}T_{c}(n^{2/3}S/S_{F})^{-2}[1 + 0.88(\xi_{0}/l_{\rm tr})\ ]\ .\]

Here \(x\)0 = 7.95 x 10-17(_n_2/_S_/_S__F_)/(_g_T__c_) is the BCS coherence length (in the _ab_ direction, in this case); and the prefactor in Eq. (9) is the slope of _H__c_2 in the clean limit. (For these purposes, we ignore factors of order unity, most notably the Gorkov function _R_(\(l_{r}\)), where 1 <= _R_(\(l_{r}\)) <= 1.17.) From Eq. (8), we obtain the estimate that _l_tr_ ~ 9 A following the second irradiation, i.e., the mean free path becomes the order of the \(x_{b}\) and is only a small multiple of the crystallographic unit-cell length. Of course, the numerical values are no more than estimates, but the resulting values are surprisingly reasonable.

A qualitative comparison of these results with the mean spacing between defects is instructive. To estimate the defect density, we first find the number pervolume (_N_/_V_)coll of neutron-atom collisions. We have (_N_/_V_)coll = (_N_/_V_)atom/_s_s_ ~ 3 x 1016 cm-3, where (_N_/_V_)atoms = 7 x 102 atoms/cm3 is the atomic number density of Bi-2223, \(d\) = 2.4 x 1017 n/cm2 is the higher neutron fluence, and \(s\) ~ 2 x 10-24 cm2 is an average nuclear cross section giving recoil energies >= 30 keV, which is the energy required to produce collision cascades.[28] The recoiling ions create localized vacancies, interstitials, and  extended collision cascades. Using the computer code trim,[29] we approximate the ion damage with that produced by 50-keV Kr ions;[28] these ions produce cascades in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) crystals that are similar to neutron-generated cascades. The Monte Carlo calculations show that each ion creates approximately 900 vacancies; irradiation with other "equivalent ions," e.g., Cr whose atomic number is the weighted average of the constituents in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{10}\), gives similar numbers of vacancies. Hence the calculated density of vacancies is \(\sim\) 3 x 10\({}^{19}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) (which may be an underestimate, since it neglects lower energy recoils). This corresponds to a mean vacancy separation of \(\sim\) 30 A, which is comparable in magnitude to the estimate for mean free path \(I_{\rm tr}\). These crude analyses strongly suggest that mean-free-path effects can play a significant role in modifying the characteristic lengths and fields in suitably modified high-\(T_{e}\) superconductors.

The dependence on neutron fluence is interesting. For moderate levels of neutron damage, one can expect an inverse variation in the mean free path, with (1/\(I_{\rm tr}\)) \(\propto\) (neutron fluence \(\phi\)); recent work[28] has shown that the measurable defect density scales linearly with neutron fluence. Reference to Eqs. (8) and (9) then suggests that the slope of \(H_{c2}\) should increase approximately linearly with fluence. Indeed, Fig. 6(a) shows just such a linear dependence for the \(H_{c2}\) slopes near \(T_{e}\), as obtained from the fluctuation and Hao-Clem analyses. The straight lines are linear fits to the experimental data. Figure 6(b) shows the dependence on fluence for the magnetic penetration depth. According to the 3D theory, this quantity depends on the mean free path in the form \(\lambda_{ab}^{2}\propto[\,1\,+\,0.88(\xi_{0}/I_{\rm tr})\,]\). Indeed, Fig. 6(b) shows an approximately linear variation with fluence, as provided theoretically. Note, also, that the expressions for \(\lambda_{ab}^{2}\) and for \(dH_{c2}/dT\) [Eq. (9)] have the _same_ functional form \(\propto[\,1\,+\,0.88(\xi_{0}/I_{\rm tr})\,]\) with different prefactors. To facilitate comparison of dependencies on fluence \(\phi\), Fig. 6(c) presents the experimental data (symbols) and linear regressions (lines), scaled in each case by the corresponding fitted value at \(\phi\) = 0. Consequently, at zero fluence, all fit lines pass through unity by construction; the experimental points lie close to unity, with some experimental scatter. The major point is that the normalized data in Fig. 6(c) have very similar slopes, i.e., very similar dependencies on \(I_{\rm tr}\), as predicted theoretically. These consistencies in this set of results further support the idea that localized damage affects the equilibrium superconducting properties via mean-free-path effects.

Recent work by Griessen _et al.[30]_ has shown that mean-free-path effects can significantly affect the nonequilibrium (hysteretic) properties of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors. In particular, they argue that the vortex pinning in a series of YBaCuO thin films is due to _scattering_ from naturally occurring pointlike defects, rather than localized depressions of \(T_{e}\).

In conclusion, this work shows that neutron-generated damage produces increases in several of the equilibrium properties of a specific high-\(T_{c}\) superconductor, Bi\({}_{1.8}\)Pb\({}_{0.3}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{10}\). For the moderate levels of neutron damage used, several independent analyses point to significant increases in the magnetic penetration depth \(\lambda_{ab}\) and upper critical magnetic field \(H_{c2}\), but no change in the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\). The results appear qualitatively consistent with well-established 3D isotropic theory for the effects of mean free path on superconducting properties. Overall, it appears that mean-free-path effects can modify the properties of high-\(T_{e}\) superconductors substantially. Further investigations are underway to explore these phenomena.

Figure 6: Dependence of the experimental quantities \(f(\phi)\) on neutron fluence \(\phi\), where \(f(\phi)\) is (a) the slope of the upper critical magnetic field \(-dH_{c2}/dT\) and (b) the square of the magnetic penetration depth \(\lambda_{ab}\), extrapolated to \(T\) = 0. Straight lines are linear regressions to illustrate the theoretical form; discrete symbols are results from the Hao-Clem data analysis (\(\blacksquare\),\(\square\)) and the fluctuation analysis (\(\blacksquare\),\(\circ\)). In (c), these results are normalized by the respective fitted values at \(\phi\) = 0, \(f_{\rm fit}(\phi\) = 0); the slopes are similar, which reasonably approximates the theoretical prediction that they are identical.
