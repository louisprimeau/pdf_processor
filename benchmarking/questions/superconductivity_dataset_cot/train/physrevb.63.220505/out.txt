27 February We calculated the electronic structure and mechanical properties within the DFT (Ref. [14]) using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method FLAPW (Ref. [15]). For the exchange-correlation potential we used the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew _et al._[16] A relatively large basis set was required to accurately calculate small changes in the electronic structure and lattice parameters with applied pressure.[17] Calculated equilibrium parameters are a = 3.089 A, c = 3.548 A, and _c_/_a_ = 1.149. They differ from the experimental values by 0.1%, 0.8%, and 0.7%, respectively. The calculated bulk modulus of B0 = 139 +- 10 GPa is in good agreement with the measured value of 151 +- 5 GPa. Both calculated and experimental lattice parameters as a function of volume are shown in Fig. 2. The agreement between theory and experiment is excellent. Over the range of pressure considered, the _c_/_a_ ratio is essentially constant, indicative of the three-dimensional character of MgB2. The small observed anisotropy of the compressibility as given by the observed reduction in the _c_/_a_ ratio with decreasing volume is reproduced by our calculations, although the rate of change is overestimated.

The superconducting properties of MgB2 as a function of pressure have been investigated by Lorenz _et al._,[8] who found that the transition temperature _T_c decreases linearly and reversibly at a rate of - 1.6 K/GPa. Within the BCS theory the pressure dependence of _T_c can be calculated from the McMillan formula

\[T_{c} = \frac{\left\langle \omega \right\rangle}{1.45}\exp\left( \frac{- 1.02(1 + \lambda)}{\lambda - \mu^{*}(1 + 0.62\lambda)} \right),\]

where _ph_ is a material dependent parameter describing the volume dependence of the electron-phonon coupling parameter and _PhD_ is the Debye temperature. For superconducting _sp_ metals one generally finds _ph_  2.5.[20] Using for the Debye temperature the recently determined value of _PhD_ = 800 K,[21] we find _ph_ = 2.4 for MgB2, a value not inconsistent with the BCS theory.

The importance of the mostly two-dimensional B p_{y} states for the superconductivity of MgB2 has been pointed out by several authors.[18, 19] The change with pressure in the partial density of states (PDOS) of B _p_ states separated into p_{y} and p_{z} characters is shown in Fig. 4. The B p_{z} PDOS

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} pressure (GPa) & volume (Å3) & a (Å) & c (Å) & _c_/_a_ \\
0.0 & 29.0391 & 3.08589(3) & 3.52121(9) & 1.1411 \\
1.17 & 28.8494 & 3.08017(28) & 3.51121(29) & 1.1399 \\
2.14 & 28.5835 & 3.07149(21) & 3.49854(52) & 1.1390 \\
3.05 & 28.5017 & 3.06709(49) & 3.48857(58) & 1.1  remain essentially unchanged, but the Bp_{xy} PDOS shows an overall shift to lower energies, leading to a loss of states in the energy range from just below the Fermi energy to \approx\!-2 eV. In general one expects the PDOS inside a fixed sphere to increase with pressure. The qualitatively different behavior of the Bp_{xy} PDOS in MgB_{2} can be attributed to the two-dimensional character of these Bp_{xy} states. However, the Bp_{xy} PDOS at the Fermi energy does not change significantly.

In conclusion, we have experimentally and theoretically determined the bulk modulus of MgB_{2} and lattice parameters up to pressures of 8 GPa. Despite an overall isotropic behavior of MgB_{2}, there are small anisotropies in the mechanical properties. The electronic structure under pressure reveals the two-dimensional character of the Bp_{xy} states whose occupancy is altered by pressure in contrast to the Bp_{z} states.

Furthermore, the pressure dependence of the density of states at the Fermi level and a reasonable value for the average phonon frequency \langle\omega\rangle account for the reduction of T_{c} under pressure within the context of the BCS theory. We find that the material dependent constant \varphi describing the volume dependence of the electron-phonon coupling parameter agrees well with the BCS theory for an sp metal.

We gratefully acknowledge discussions with M. Weinert and M. Strongin. We also would like to thank J. Hu from the Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington for being able to use the laser system for pressure determination.
