###### Abstract

We present a systematic study on the physical properties of
EuFe2-Ni_(x)As₂ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) by electrical resistivity, magnetic
susceptibility, and thermopower measurements. The undoped compound
EuFe2As₂ undergoes a spin density wave (SDW) transition associated with
Fe moments at 195 K, followed by antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of
Eu2+ moments at 20 K. Ni doping at the Fe site simultaneously suppresses
the SDW transition and AFM ordering of Eu2+ moments. For x ≥ 0.06, the
magnetic ordering of Eu2+ moments evolves from antiferromagnetic to
ferromagnetic (FM). The SDW transition is completely suppressed for x ≥
0.16, however, no superconducting transition was observed down to 2 K.
The possible origins of the AFM-to-FM transition and the absence of
superconductivity in the EuFe2-,Ni_(x)As₂ system are discussed.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity up to 56 K in iron-based arsenides
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] has aroused great interest in the community of
condensed-matter physics. The undoped parent compounds adopt the
tetragonal structure at room temperature, which consists of [Fe2As2]2-
layers separated alternatively by [Ln2O2]2+ (Refs. 8 and 9) or A²⁺ (A =
Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu) layers. [10, 11, 12, 13] At low temperatures, the parent
compounds undergo a structural phase transition from tetragonal to
orthorhombic, accompanied [14] or followed [15] by a SDW-like
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transition. Doping with electrons or holes
in the parent compounds suppresses the phase transitions and induces the
high temperature superconductivity. This intimate connection between
superconductivity and magnetism suggests unconventional
superconductivity in the iron-based arsenides. [16, 17, 18]

Very recently, superconductivity has been observed in LaFe1-_x_M_(x)AsO
[19, 20, 21] and BaFe2-_x_M_(x)As₂[22, 23] (M = Co and Ni). These
findings are quite remarkable and challenge our common wisdom of
superconductivity, which shows that direct doping in the
superconducting-active blocks generally destroys superconductivity. In
high-_T_(c)_ cuprates, actually, Ni substitution for Cu in the CuO₂
planes drastically reduces _T_(c)_. Hence these experimental results
provide clues to the superconducting mechanism for the iron-based
arsenide superconductors. Currently, an itinerant scenario within rigid
band model is more favored to understand this unusual doping-induced
superconductivity. [24]

EuFe2As₂ is a unique member in the ternary iron arsenide family due to
the fact that Eu2+ ions carry local moments, which order
antiferromagnetically below 20 K. [12, 25, 26] Except this AFM
transition, the physical properties of EuFe2As₂ were found to be quite
similar with those of its isostructural compounds BaFe2As₂ and SrFe2As₂,
[25] both of which become superconducting upon appropriate doping. [27,
28, 29] It was then expected that EuFe2As₂ could be tuned
superconducting through similar doping strategies. Indeed,
superconductivity with _T_(c)_ over 30 K has been observed in (Eu,
K)Fe2As₂ (Ref. 30) and (Eu,Na)Fe2As₂. [31]

Doping at the Fe site in EuFe2As₂ takes advantage of inducing possible
superconductivity while leaving the magnetic Eu2+ layers intact, which
could provide us insight to the interplay between superconductivity and
magnetism. Here we report a systematic study on the physical properties
in EuFe2-,Ni_(x)As₂ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) system. It was found that both the SDW
ordering of Fe moments and the AFM ordering of Eu2+ moments were
suppressed by substituting Fe with Ni. Ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of
Eu2+ moments emerges for x ≥ 0.06. While the SDW transition is
completely suppressed for x ≥ 0.16, no superconducting transition was
observed down to 2 K in EuFe2-xNi_(x)As₂, in contrast with the
superconductivity in BaFe2-_x_Ni_(x)As₂. [23] Our results suggest a
strong coupling between the magnetism of Eu2+ ions and the conduction
electrons of [Fe2-xNi_(x)As₂]2- layers.

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of EuFe2-,Ni_(x)As₂ (_x_ = 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09,
0.12, 0.16, and 0.2) were synthesized by solid-state reaction with EuAs,
Fe2As and Ni2As. EuAs was pre-synthesized by reacting Eu grains and As
powders in evacuated silica tube at 873 K for 10 h then 1123 K for 36 h.
Fe2As was presynthesized by reacting Fe powers and As powders at 873 K
for 10 h and 1173 K for 2.5 h. Ni2As was presynthesized by reacting Ni
powders and As powders at 873 K for 10 h then 1073 K for another 10 h.
The powders of EuAs, Fe2As, and Ni2As were weighed according to the
stoichiometric ratio, thoroughly ground and pressed into pellets in an
argon-filled glove box. The pellets were sealed in evacuated quartz
tubes and annealed at 1173 K for 24 h and furnace-cooled to room
temperature. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room
temperature using a D/Max-rA diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and a
graphite monochromator. The data were collected with a step-scan mode.
The structural refinements were performed using the program rietan 2000.
[32] The electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four-probe
method. The measurements of dc magnetic properties were performed on a
quantum design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS-5).
Thermopower measurements were carried out in a cryogenic refrigerator
down to 17 K by a steady-state technique with a temperature gradient ∼1
K/cm.

## III Results and Discussion

The crystal structure for all the EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ (x = 0,0.03,
0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.16, 0.2) samples at room temperature was refined
with the tetragonal ThCr₂Si₂ structure. An example of the refinement
profile for EuFe_(1.97)Ni_(0.03)As₂ is shown in Fig. 1(a). The weighted
pattern factor and goodness of fit are $R_{\rm np}$∼ 1.12

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity (ρ) for the
EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ samples. The ρ value at 300 K decreases with
increasing Ni content, which is probably attributed to the increase of
carrier concentration induced by the Ni doping. For the parent compound,
ρ drops rapidly below 195 K and shows a kink at ∼20 K. The former is
associated with a SDW transition of Fe moments while the latter is due
to the AFM ordering of Eu²⁺ moments.[25] On Ni doping, the anomaly in ρ
associated with the SDW transition is presented as an upturn, followed
by a hump. This behavior resembles that observed in
BaFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ crystals.[23] With increasing Ni content x,
$T_{\rm SDW}$ shifts to lower temperatures. For x≈ 0.16 the SDW
transition is completely suppressed, however, no superconducting
transition was observed down to the lowest temperature in the present
study. Instead, two kinks in ρ at low temperatures are present, which
can be seen more clearly in the derivative plots as shown in the inset
of Fig. 2. It is probable that they share the same origin as that of
undoped EuFe₂As₂ under magnetic fields, which is related to the
different magnetic states of Eu²⁺ moments.[33]

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of thermopower (S) for
EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ samples. The sign reversal behavior, which
manifests multiband scenario, is observed for x=0 and 0.03. The value of
S for the other samples is negative. With increasing Ni content, the
room-temperature thermopower is pushed toward more negative values, as

x=0.16 and 0.2 below 40 K. The anomalies are marked by arrows.

shown in the inset of Fig. 3. For a simple two-band model with electrons
and holes, S can be expressed as

$$S = \frac{n_{h}\mu_{h}|S_{h}|-n_{c}\mu_{c}|S_{c}|}{n_{h}\mu_{h}+n_{c}\mu_{c}},$$
(1)

where n_(h(c)), μ_(h(c)), and |S_(h(c))| denote the concentration,
mobility and thermopower contribution of the holes (electrons),
respectively. Therefore, the increase in |S| suggests that Ni doping
increases the electron concentration. Meanwhile, the anomaly due to the
SDW transition is suppressed to lower temperatures and is no longer
visible for x=0.16, in agreement with the above resistivity
measurements. Recently, it was found that there exists enhanced
thermopower in the superconducting window of SmFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)AsO
system.[20] In the present system, no such enhancement was observed,
which may be related to the absence of superconductivity.

Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility
(χ) for the EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ samples below 40 K under an applied
field of 20 Oe. The χ data of 25 ≤ T≤ 180 K for x ≥ 0.03 basically fall
onto the same curve, which can be well fitted by the modified
Curie-Weiss law,

$$\chi = X_{0}+\frac{C}{T-\theta},$$
(2)

where χ₀ denotes the temperature-independent term, C as the Curie-Weiss
constant, and θ as the paramagnetic Curie temperature. The refined
parameters are C=8.0(1) emu K/mol and θ=19(1) K. The calculated
effective moment $P_{\rm eff}$ is ∼8μ_(B) per formula unit, close to the
theoretical value of 7.94μ_(B) for a free Eu²⁺ ion. It is evident that
the valence state of Eu ions remains +2 and ferromagnetic interaction
between Eu²⁺ moments dominates up to 10

Figure 4(b) shows the field dependence of magnetization for the
EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ samples at 2 K. For x=0.03, a slope change in the
M-H curve can be seen clearly at μ₀H =0.55 T, which is ascribed to a
field-induced metamagnetic transition.[25, 33, 34] Moreover, there is no
hysteresis loop in the low field region, consistent with the AFM ground
state of Eu²⁺ moments. For the other samples, however, M increases
steeply with initial increasing H. In addition, small hysteresis loops
are observed. These results are in agreement with the above
susceptibility measurements, suggesting that Eu²⁺ moments are FM ordered
for x ≥ 0.06. It is noted that all the

plot of the low field region for x=0.03 and 0.16.

saturated magnetic moments are around 6.3μ_(B) per formula, which is
smaller than the theoretical value of 7μ_(B) for a free Eu²⁺ ion. This
discrepancy is attributed to presence of impurity phases, whose magnetic
response is much weaker.

Our experimental results on the physical properties of the
EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ system are summarized in the magnetic phase
diagram in Fig. 5. The parent compound EuFe₂As₂ shows AFM ordering of
Eu²⁺ moments at 20 K as well as SDW ordering of Fe moments at 195 K.
With Ni doping, both the orderings are suppressed. On one hand, the SDW
transition is gradually suppressed and eventually disappears at x =0.16.
Nevertheless, no superconductivity was observed down to 2 K. On the
other hand, the magnetic ordering of Eu²⁺ moments changes from AFM to FM
at x = 0.06. This observation is surprising in view of the AFM ordering
of Eu²⁺ moments in both the end members EuFe₂As₂ and EuNi₂As₂[35]. By
contrast, $T_{\rm N\acute{e}el}$ remains nearly unchanged upon 10

The AFM structure of Eu²⁺ moments in EuFe₂As₂ is proposed to be of
A-type, i.e., FM coupling for intralayer Eu²⁺ moments while AFM coupling
for interlayer Eu²⁺ moments[33, 25, 34]. The distance between nearest
Eu²⁺ layers is ∼ 6 A hence direct overlap of interlayer Eu 4f orbitals
can be neglected. Therefore, the AFM exchange between interlayer Eu²⁺
moments is probably ascribed to the carrier-mediated
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction[35]. The RKKY exchange
coupling
$J_{\rm RKKY}$∝$-\frac{\alpha\cos\alpha-\sin\alpha}{\alpha^{4}}$, where
α=2k_(F)R, R denotes the distance between two magnetic moments and k_(F)
the Fermi vector. One can see that $J_{\rm RKKY}$ oscillates between AFM
(negative) and FM (positive) at the variation of 2k_(F)R. Considering
the dimensionality of the Fermi surfaces, it is probably that heavy
three-dimensional (3D) hole pocket derived from Fe d_(z) states[18] is
responsible for mediating the RKKY interaction. Substitution of Fe with
Ni introduces electrons, which results in the decrease in k_(F)^(z).
Meanwhile, R is also shortened, as indicated by the reduction in c axis.
Thus the interlayer coupling may be tuned from AFM to FM. On the other
hand, the FM interaction within the Eu²⁺ layers persists up to 10

In the iron-based arsenides, superconductivity generally emerges as the
SDW order is suppressed by the carrier doping. As a matter of fact,
superconductivity with the maximum T_(c) of ∼20 K has been observed in
BaFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ system[23]. Thus, the absence of superconductivity
in EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ may be relevant to the magnetism of Eu²⁺ ions.
The RKKY interaction mentioned above may hinder the Cooper pairing for
superconductivity. Recently, re-entrant superconducting behavior has
been observed in a high pressure study of EuFe₂As₂ crystal[37]. The
results suggest that once T_(c) becomes smaller than the magnetic
ordering temperature of Eu²⁺ moments, superconductivity will be
completely suppressed. If EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ were superconducting,
its maximum T_(c) would be ∼ 6 K smaller than that of
BaFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ due to the existence of paramagnetic Eu²⁺
ions[37]. The assumed T_(c) is below the Curie temperatures. This could
account for the absence of superconductivity in EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂
system.

## IV IV. Conclusion

In summary, we have systematically studied the transport and magnetic
properties on a series of EuFe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂ polycrystalline samples
with 0≤ x ≤ 0.2. It is found that both the SDW transition associated
with the Fe moments and the AFM ordering of Eu²⁺ moments are suppressed
upon Ni doping. Though the SDW transition is completely suppressed for x
≤ 0.16, no superconducting transition is observed down to 2 K.
Surprisingly, a FM ground state of Eu²⁺ moments emerges for x ≥ 0.06. A
detailed magnetic phase diagram is presented and discussed within the
RKKY framework. Our results suggest there exists a strong coupling
between the magnetism of Eu²⁺ ions and the electronic state in the
[Fe_(2 − x)Ni_(x)As₂]²⁻ layers.
