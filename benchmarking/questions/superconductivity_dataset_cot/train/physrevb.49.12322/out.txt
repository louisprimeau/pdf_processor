###### Abstract

High volume fractions of the n = 2 and n = 3 members of a cuprate system of general formula Hg1-_x_Pb,Ba2Ca - [ pellet of the mixture is wrapped in gold foil and loaded in a quartz tube, which is pumped down to 10-6 torr, filled with 10-1 torr of pure oxygen, and then sealed. The quartz tube is placed inside a steel container and fired in a tube furnace using a protocol wherein the reaction temperature is raised to 800 degC in 2-5h, held at 800 degC for 2 h and cooled to 30degC in 6 h. Relatively short firing times were used for the synthesis because the presence of lead was observed to catalyze the formation of the n = 3 phase. Synthesis of pure Hg,Pb-1:2:1:2 is achieved by incorporation of more oxygen via substitution of the calcium ions with a trivalent rare-earth ion, such as yttrium.

The Cu_Ka_ x-ray powder-diffraction (using a Rigaku diffractometer) data for the Y-doped Hg,Pb-1:2:1:2 and Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 phases are shown in Fig. 1. The reflections corresponding to the n = 2 and n = 3 phases are indexed for a tetragonal cell with lattice parameters (calibrated using an internal standard) of a = 3.8612(8) A and c = 12.640(4) A, and a = 3.849(4) A and c = 15.860(2) A, respectively. In the Hg,Pb-1:2:1:2 phase sample, BaCuO2 and CuO are present as impurities, while HgCaO2 and CuO are observed as impurities in Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3. The values of the lattice constants are similar to those reported for the n = 2 and n = 3 phases of the Hg cuprate system,5,6 suggesting that effects of chemical pressure due to the incorporation of the smaller Pb4+ ions are minimal. The impurity phases were also detected using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in a JEOL 4000FX electron microscope. The EDS data were collected using a Link detector and pulse processor, with a Moran Scientific analyzer. EDS data for the Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 sample displayed in Fig. 1 show an average Hg:Pb ratio of 0.66:0.33 and an average composition of (Hg,Pb)Ba2Ca2Cu3O7. Differences in the oxygen sublattice structure between the Hg and the Hg,Pb cuprates are indicated by Raman-scattering data on these materials. Samples of Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 and 1:2:1:2 show two intrinsic scattering peaks at 570 and 495 cm-1, which can be assigned to the stretching vibration of the apical oxygen atoms coordinated respectively to the Hg2+ and the Pb2+ or Pb4+ ions in the mixed Hg,Pb-O layer. The presence of Pb4+ ions would also result in the presence of more intercalated oxygen in the Hg,Pb-O layer and a concomitant change in the apical-oxygen-bond force constant. By contrast the Raman spectra of Hg-1:2:2:3 and 1:2:1:2 obtained by Ren _et al._10 display a single apical-oxygen vibrational mode in the 580-cm-1 region, consistent with the presence of only Hg2+ ions in the Hg-O layer. Also, an increase in the apical-oxygen-mode frequency relative to that of the Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 compound is observed, probably due to the presence of less intercalated oxygen in the Hg-O layer.

Lattice imaging at a structure resolution of 2.3 A coupled with simulations were performed to determine the details of the structure of as-synthesized Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3. A lattice image in the [100] orientation taken at 400 kV is shown in Fig. 2. A simulation for defocus -800 A, and thickness 12 A, is shown as an inset in Fig. 2. In the simulation, which shows a good match to the n = 3 phase, the Hg plane consists of 0.66 Hg and 0.33 Pb atoms. The atomic positions for the simulation were derived from the positions of the Hg-1:2:1:2 phase,5 to which extra Ca-O and Cu-O layers were added to model the three-layer compound. The Cu-O to Cu-O interplanar spacings were taken to be the same as that of the n = 3 Tl-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O compound.11 The images show occasional intergrowths of the n = 2 phase. Intergrowths of the four-copper-layer phase are also evident, albeit more rarely. The (100) electron-diffraction pattern (inset, Fig. 2) gives a _c_-axis spacing of 15.9A, in agreement with the x-ray-diffraction data. The electron-diffraction pattern shows intense diffuse scattering near the central beam, which extends over a reciprocal-space distance of 0.5A-1 from the center of the pattern (equivalent to a 2-A spacing in real space). We interpret the intense scattering to be due to vacancies in the oxygen sublattice, which are possibly induced by the compositional modulation in the Hg,Pb-O plane (see below). This observation suggests that the as-synthesized Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 samples remain somewhat underdoped with respect to holes.

The lattice images display a modulation in the Hg,Pb layer, which is likely to be associated with a periodic Hg-Pb compositional variation. Note, however, that this

Reflections labeled ( ) and ( ) are associated with HgCaO2 and CuO, respectively, in the diffraction pattern of the Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 phase. The bottom trace shows the energy-dispersive spectrum (EDS) for a Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 crystallite.

  modulation is not manifested as superlattice reflections in the electron-diffraction patterns. The Fourier-processed image (inset, Fig. 2) clearly shows that this somewhat irregular modulation extends to 30 A in the [110] direction. This modulation probably allows the lattice to relieve the chemical pressure induced by substitution of the smaller Pb^{4+} ions into the Hg,Pb plane, consistent with the observed absence of a decrease in unit-cell volume in the Hg,Pb cuprates relative to the pure Hg cuprates. The compositional modulation and defects induced by it in the oxygen sublattice may provide the key doping and flux-pinning centers in the Hg,Pb cuprates.

Figure 3 shows the normalized dc resistivity data obtained in the four-probe configuration for a typical as-synthesized Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 sample. Zero resistance occurs at a temperature of 130 K, while the transition onset temperature is near 140 K. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) (SHE VTS 900) magnetometer data in a 50 G field for this sample, shown in Fig. 4, indicate a single diamagnetic transition with an onset temperature of 133 K, and a zero-field-cooled (ZFC) superconducting volume fraction greater than 80%. However, the field-cooled (FC) volume fraction is a factor of 10 lower, most likely due to a high degree of flux pinning in the sample. This conjecture is supported by SQUID (Quantum Design) magnetization measurements at 1G on a similarly synthesized but powdered Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 sample with a diamagnetic transition onset at 132 K, where the FC susceptibility after diamagnetic corrections is 50% of -1/4\pi at 100 K, and the ZFC volume fraction is over

  90%. Careful measurements of the onset temperature of modulated low-field microwave absorption, which is caused by flux jumps across local Josephson junctions formed in the superconducting state, have been made on a number of Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 samples using an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (Varian E9) operating at 9.2 GHz. These measurements indicate an onset T_{c} of 138 K as can be seen from the temperature-dependent data for a Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 sample shown in Fig. 3 (inset). This temperature is near the resistive onset temperatures for similar samples (Fig. 3) but it is about 5 K higher than the values obtained from SQUID magnetometer measurements. The higher microwave-absorption onset temperatures may reflect the greater sensitivity of the microwave-absorption technique [12] to superconductivity in a minority higher-T_{c} phase in the Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 samples. More interestingly, however, the initial microwave absorption and resistive drop may be associated with a superconducting-pair fluctuation regime above T_{c} in these materials. Significant order-parameter fluctuations between 133 and 145 K have also been invoked by Schilling _et al._[13] in Hg-1:2:2:3 in order to account for an upturn in their specific-heat data and higher-temperature resistive onsets.

Annealing the Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 samples under reducing conditions (1% hydrogen in nitrogen) for 16 h at 300 degC decreases the sample resistivity, but has no effect on T_{c}. However, T_{c} is typically reduced to 118 K on annealing the samples in flowing oxygen at 300 degC. This suggests that the as-synthesized Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 specimens have near-optimum hole doping levels, although some degree of underdoping is indicated by the observed increases in T_{c} with pressure [14] and the appearance of diffuse scattering in the electron-diffraction data. The nearly single-phase Hg,Pb-1:2:1:2 samples prepared by doping the Ca sites with Y show a T_{c} of 115 K in SQUID magnetometer measurements in the as-prepared condition. The T_{c} decreases to near 100 K on annealing in flowing oxygen, but increases to 125 K on annealing under reducing conditions at 300 degC for 16 h. This observation suggests that Y^{3+} substitution results in overdoping of the Hg,Pb-1:2:1:2 phase with holes.

The irreversibility field H^{\bullet}(T), which defines the boundary separating a magnetically irreversible zero-resistance state from a magnetically reversible state with a dissipative electrical resistivity, was obtained for a number of Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 samples from the merging points of ZFC and FC magnetization data. [15] The inset in Fig. 4 shows a plot of H^{\bullet}(T) as a function of reduced temperature for two typical Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 samples. The linear fit (dashed line) defines the irreversibility line H_{i} separating the dissipative from the flux-pinned region of the magnetic phase diagram. For Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3, H_{i} lies at temperatures much higher than that for the three-copper-layer Bi-based cuprates [7] and the single-copper-layer Hg and Hg,Pb compounds. [8, 9]H^{\bullet}(T) is 1 T at 80 K in Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3, which is substantially higher than the corresponding fields of 0.3 T and lower for the n=3 phase Bi-based and the n=1 phase Hg and Hg,Pb compounds. In addition, at 100 K rather low values of flux creep relative to those in the corresponding Bi- and Tl-based cuprates are observed for Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 at fields up to 0.1 T. These encouraging initial results indicate that Hg,Pb-1:2:2:3 is likely to be an attractive candidate for high-temperature superconductor applications.
