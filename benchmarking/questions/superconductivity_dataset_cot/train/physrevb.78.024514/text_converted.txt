###### Abstract

A single crystal of superconducting Lu₂Fe₃Si₅ was studied using the
tunnel-diode resonator technique in the Meissner and mixed states. The
temperature dependence of the superfluid density provides strong
evidence for two-gap superconductivity and indicates that there are
nearly equal contributions from each gap having magnitudes of
Δ₁/k_(B)T_(c)=1.86 and Δ₂/k_(B)T_(c)=0.54. In the vortex state, the
pinning strength shows unusually strong temperature dependence and is
nonmonotonic with the magnetic field (peak effect). The irreversibility
line is sharply defined and quite distant from the H_(c2)(T) line, which
hints at enhanced vortex fluctuations in this two-gap system.
Altogether, our findings from electromagnetic measurements provide
strong support for the existence of two-gap superconductivity in
Lu₂Fe₃Si₅, as previously suggested from specific-heat measurements.

## I Introduction

Initially, interest in the rare-earth iron containing silicides M₂Fe₃Si₅
(M= Y,Sc, and Lu) was due to unusually high superconducting critical
temperatures (2.4, 4.5, and 6.0 K, respectively) for compounds
containing crystallographically ordered iron sublattices.[1]⁵⁷Fe
Mossbauer effect measurements indicate that the iron in these materials
possess no magnetic moments.[2, 3] Further detailed studies have
revealed that other superconducting properties are quite unconventional.
The upper critical field H_(c2)(0) for Lu₂Fe₃Si₅ has been found to be
unusually large when compared to the other iron-containing silicide
superconductors.[4, 5] and its temperature dependence differs from
convention. Anisotropy and a pronounced peak effect have also been
reported in magnetic measurements.[6] The presence of a large residual
electronic term in the specific heat below T_(c), as well as a reduced
specific heat jump at T_(c), has been observed and confirmed indicating
departure from standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like
behavior.[7, 6] Nonmagnetic impurities have been shown to suppress T_(c)
at a significant rate, which is incompatible with the isotropic s-wave
BCS picture.[8, 9] On the other hand, ac Josephson effect measurements
have indicated an s-wave pairing mechanism.[10] Vining, Shelton, Braun,
and Pelizzone have proposed a two-band model in order to explain their
specific-heat data.[7] Their model assumes a two-band Fermi surface with
one band being superconducting and gapped, and another being normal.
This represents an extreme case of multiband superconductivity as we
know it today, for example in MgB₂, where different bands have gaps of
different magnitudes.[11, 12] Later detailed measurements of Lu₂Fe₃Si₅
crystals and analysis have shown that specific-heat data is explained
quantitatively well within a two-band model of superconductivity where
both bands are gapped but with different gap amplitudes.[13] Recently, a
class of superconductors, the iron-containing oxypnictides, was
discovered.[14] It has been suggested that these materials could also be
multigap superconductors.[15]

In this contribution, precision measurements of the London and Campbell
penetration depths are presented, the superfluid density is analyzed,
and unusual vortex properties are reported. We conclude that Lu₂Fe₃Si₅
is, indeed, a two-gap superconductor. It seems that multiband
superconductivity is more widespread and develops when there are
different dimensionalities of the Fermi surface on different bands,
which leads to reduced interband scattering. In MgB₂ there are two- and
three-dimensional bands,[11, 12] whereas Lu₂Fe₃Si₅ has one- and
three-dimensional Fermi surfaces.[13]

## II Experiment

### Tunnel-diode resonator technique

Measurements of the Lu₂Fe₃Si₅ single crystal were performed using a
tunnel diode resonator (TDR).[16, 17, 18] An extended review of the use
of a TDR to study superconductors is given in Ref. [16]. The main
components of the TDR are an LC tank circuit and a tunnel diode. The
tunnel diode has a region of negative differential resistance in its I-V
curve. If a dc bias voltage is applied across the diode in this region,
then it acts as an ac power source for the LC tank circuit. This results
in a self-oscillating circuit, which resonates continuously at a
constant frequency for given values of L and C. The resonance frequency
of the circuit used in our measurements was near 14 MHz. All throughout
the measurements the circuit is kept at a constant temperature, 4.8 K ±
1 mK, allowing for a stability of 0.05 Hz in the resonance frequency
over several hours. The sample to be studied is mounted on a sapphire
rod with a small amount of Apiezon N grease. The sapphire is inserted
inside of the inductor coil of the tank circuit. It is important that
the sample and its mount do not make physical contact with the coil so
that the temperature of the sample may be changed while keeping the
circuit at a constant temperature to maintain the stability. As the
magnetic susceptibility of the sample changes with temperature, so does
the inductance of the tank coil. This results in a change in the TDR
resonance frequency. By measuring the shift in the resonance frequency,
we are able to sense changes in the penetration depth on the order of
0.5 Angstroms. Specifically, the frequency shift, Δf=f(T) − f₀, with
respect to the resonant frequency of an empty coil, f₀, is given by

$$\Delta f(T)=-\,G4\,\pi\chi(T)=G\left[1-\frac{\lambda}{R}\mathrm{tanh}\left(\frac{ R}{\lambda}\right)\right],$$
(1)

where G ≈ f₀V_(s)/2V_(c)(1 − N) is the geometry-dependent calibration
constant, V_(s) is sample volume, V_(c) is the effective coil volume,
and N is the demagnetization factor. The effective sample dimension R is
calculated by using the technique shown in Ref. [17]. As described in
detail in Ref. [18], it is difficult to obtain the absolute value of the
penetration depth due to uncertainties in the sample dimension. However,
it is possible to calibrate the system with great accuracy by using the
temperature-dependent skin depth, δ(T), measured just above T_(c). In
that regime, both the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are
taken into account and the frequency shift due to the skin effect is
Δf(T)_(T > T_(c)) = G[1 − (δ/2R)tanh(2R/δ)]. The skin depth,
$\delta(T)\!=\!c\sqrt{\rho(T)/2\pi\omega}$, is evaluated independently
from the temperature-dependent resistivity, ρ(T), measured by the
four-probe technique. This is shown in Fig. 1, where resonator data are
shown in empty circles and data obtained from measured resistivity are
shown as a solid line. Apparently, the agreement is very good. In
addition to excellent stability and sensitivity, an advantage of this
technique is the use of very low excitation fields, ∼20 mOe, which
ensures that the sample is in the Meissner state. Furthermore, by
superimposing an external dc field, we can probe the vortex state in the
so-called Campbell regime, where small excitations ensure that the
vortices remain in their potential wells.

### Samples

The single crystal of Lu₂Fe₃Si₅ was grown by the floating-zone technique
using an image furnace followed by an annealing as described in detail
elsewhere.[13] The sample was a rectangular slab having dimensions
0.99 × 0.84 × 0.15 mm³ with the c axis perpendicular to the largest
face. To study possible anisotropy of the response, the measurements
were performed with the excitation field both parallel and perpendicular
to the c axis of the sample. A ³He cryostat with the sample in vacuum
and applied external fields of up to 9 T was used for the reported
studies.

## III Results and discussion

### London penetration depth (H_(dc)=0)

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the London penetration
depth, λ_(ab)(T), obtained from measurements along and perpendicular to
the c axis. Both orientations give λ_(ab)(T). This is because the
penetration depth is proportional to the volume of magnetic field
penetrating the sample from different sides. When the excitation field
is applied parallel to the c axis, only the in-plane currents circulate
and λ_(ab)(T) is measured directly. However, this configuration is more
difficult to deal with due to a large demagnetization factor. When the
excitation field is applied perpendicular to the c axis, currents
circulate in both the ab plane and along the c-axis direction. However,
since our sample is thin along the c-axis direction, the relative
contribution of the currents along this direction,
∼  t/ ψλ_(c)/λ_(ab) = 0.16λ_(c)/λ_(ab), can be neglected and hence
λ_(ab)(T) is measured for this orientation as well. Here w and t are the
planar dimension and thickness, respectively. In addition, the
anisotropy of this system is small so the error introduced by the above
approximation is minimal. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the penetration
depth is very nearly the same for the sample measured in both
orientations. The value of λ_(ab)(0) = 0.2μm was obtained, as described
in Ref. [16], from the reversible magnetization dM/ d ln H. This was
measured independently on the same sample using a _Quantum Design_
magnetometer. In further analysis, possible uncertainty in this number
up to 25

The symbols in Fig. 3 show the temperature-dependent superfluid density,
ρ_(c)(T) = [λ(0)/λ(T)]², calculated from the penetration depth shown in
Fig. 2. The solid red curve is the total superfluid density calculated
from the α model, which

assumes two independent contributions to the total superfluid density
and has been successfully applied to the well-known two-gap
superconductor MgB₂.[11, 12] In this model each superconducting gap,
denoted by Δ₁(T) and Δ₂(T), has a similar temperature dependence as that
given by the weak-coupling BCS self-consistency equation.[16] However,
there are different ratios of Δ₁(0)/k_(B)T_(c) that become two fitting
parameters. A third fitting parameter gives the relative contribution of
each band to the total superfluid density,
$\rho_{\rm total}(T)$=xρ₁(T) + (1 − x)ρ₂(T). Each superfluid density is
calculated by using the full temperature range semiclassical BCS
treatment as described in detail elsewhere.[16] These partial ρ₁(T) and
ρ₂(T) are shown by marked solid lines in Fig. 3. The best fit was
achieved with x=0.51, Δ₁/k_(B)T_(c)=1.86, and Δ₂/k_(B)T_(c)=0.54. The
first gap is quite close to the weak-coupling value of 1.76, whereas the
second gap is much smaller and it is surprising that the earlier
two-band model assumed it to be fully normal.[7] Similar to MgB₂, the
two gaps contribute equally to the superfluid density. A dashed line,
which almost follows the data, is calculated from the parameters
obtained from analyzing the specific-heat data. The parameters obtained
from this line are x=0.47, Δ₁/k_(B)T_(c)=2.2, and
Δ₂/k_(B)T_(c)=0.55.[13] This is in quite good agreement with the values
obtained for the superfluid density, given the very different nature of
the measurements. To further highlight the qualitative differences
between single- and two-gap behavior, we have plotted dρ_(s)/dt in Fig.
4. Note the characteristic nonmonotonic behavior in the case of two
gaps. It is neither present in the pure d-wave nor the pure s-wave case.

### Campbell penetration depth ($H_{\rm dc}$≠ 0)

While the situation is quite clear for the London penetration depth,
measurements in an applied magnetic field reveal more puzzling behavior
of the studied compound. When an external dc field is applied and a
small amplitude ac response is probed, the vortices respond elastically
and the overall susceptibility is governed by the Campbell penetration
depth, λ²=λ_(L)²+λ_(C)², where λ_(L) is the usual London penetration
depth described above, and λ_(C)(B, T, j) is the Campbell penetration
depth, ⁹λ_(C)²=ϕ₀B/4πα(j). Here ϕ₀ is the flux quantum and α(j) is the
Labusch parameter that generally depends on the biasing Bean current
generated in the sample, for example after applying a field after
cooling in zero field. The magnetic susceptibility of the sample (and
the frequency shift) in the vortex state is still given by Eq. (1), but
with a generalized penetration depth.

In conventional type-II superconductors there is no hysteresis for
zero-field-cooled (zfc) and field-cooled (fc) curves of the small
amplitude ac response. However, in materials where j_(c) is strongly
temperature dependent (e.g., high-T_(c) cuprates), a large hysteresis is
observed.[19] As shown in Ref. [19], a cubic correction to a parabolic
potential well for vortex pinning leads to
α(j)=$\alpha_{0}\sqrt{1}-j/j_{c}$, where j_(c)=cα₀r_(p)/ϕ₀ is the
critical current and r_(p) is the radius of the pinning potential. This
model explains why the zero-field-cooled curve differs from subsequent
cooling and warming, and it was successfully used to explain the data
for the Bi₂Sr₂CaCu₂O_(8 + y) superconductor.

4πχ(T) in the vortex state of Lu₂Fe₃Si₃ is shown in Fig. 5 for three
representative fields. In each case the sample was cooled in zero
applied field to the base temperature and the indicated magnetic field
was applied. Then the measurements were taken while warming up the
sample above T_(c) (zfc-w). Then, the sample was cooled and warmed twice
without changing the field and while taking the data (fc − c and fc−w).
For low field values there is no hysteresis observed, while at
intermediate fields the hysteresis becomes very pronounced. Clearly, the
hysteresis is associated with the static Bean current, j, induced by
applying field. We also note that this effect is not associated with the
vortex density (e.g., less vortices after zfc) because then the initial
Campbell length would be smaller than it is at equilibrium, not larger
as observed.

By measuring many 4πχ(T) curves at different magnetic fields, we
extracted field dependence of the initial suscepti

total superfluid density. Also shown and labeled are the two partial
superfluid densities as described in the text. The dashed line is
calculated from the parameters derived from the specific heat data. The
best fit to the d-wave order parameter is shown for comparison
(dot-dashed line).

bility obtained after zfc and fc. Figure 6 shows the resulting
$4\,\pi\chi_{\rm irr}(H)$ (open circles) and $4\,\pi\chi_{\rm rev}(H)$
(closed squares) curves at T=0.7 K. Figure 7 shows the difference
between the two curves. This difference is directly related to the
strength of pinning and magnitude of the apparent Bean current density,
j, ΔX∼j/j_(c), where we have assumed j≪j_(c). There is a clear peak
effect and its location is quite compatible with direct measurements
reported in Ref. [6].

Finally, we construct the H−T phase diagram obtained from our
measurements for both directions. While the Meissner response is
governed by currents flowing in the ab plane, in an applied magnetic
field the response is anisotropic and is determined by the orientation
of the vortices with respect to the crystal axes. We observe large
anisotropy of the upper critical field, H_(c2)(T), down to 1 K as shown
in Fig. 8, which has not been reported in earlier papers. Furthermore,
H_(c2)(T), determined from the TDR measurements, is in excellent
agreement with the specific-heat data. Note that H_(c2)(T) is linear in
temperature down to 0.15T_(c).

Figure 8 also shows position of the irreversibility line (see Fig. 5 for
definition) for both orientations. Unlike conventional superconductors,
where $H_{\rm irr}(T)$ is very difficult to determine due to its gradual
merging into H_(c2)(T), in Lu₂Fe₃Si₅ it is sharply defined and is quite
distant from the H_(c2)(T). This is another indication of significant
reduction of the critical current possibly due to enhanced fluctuations
in the two-gap system.

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, we have found that Lu₂Fe₃Si₅ shows a Meissner response
compatible with two-gap s-wave superconductivity. In the vortex state,
it shows unusually strong temperature dependence of the critical
current, which is also nonmonotonic with magnetic field (peak effect).
The upper critical field is anisotropic and linear in temperature. All
these observations are reminiscent of unconventional superconductivity
and further theoretical insight to connect these properties is needed.
