###### Abstract

We have carried out high-resolution dilatometry experiments on a series of high-quality single crystals of La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 with various Sr content on both the under- and overdoped side of the T_{c}(x) phase diagram. A simple _in situ_ technique was applied to prevent the usual twinning of the samples in the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase, which allows us to study the full anisotropy of the thermal expansion of the LTO phase. From the anomalies in the linear expansivities \Delta\alpha_{i} (_i_ = a,_b_,_c_) at T_{c} we deduce all three uniaxial stress (dT_{c}/dp_{i}) and strain (dT_{c}/d\epsilon_{i}) dependences, which turn out to be large and almost cancel for hydrostatic pressure.

Much experimental and theoretical work has been carried out in order to study the correlation between structure and superconductivity of CuO-based high-temperature superconductors (HTSC). Of particular interest are the doped lanthanum cuprates La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 (_M_ = Sr, Ba) because these compounds exhibit a variety of phase transitions at low temperatures.1 Both the Sr-doped (LSCO) and Ba-doped (LBCO) compounds undergo a second-order structural phase transition from a high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) to a low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase, where the CuO6 octahedra tilt around an (110)tetr direction of the tetragonal unit cell. Corner-shared octahedra tilt in opposing directions. The transition temperature T_{\rm TO} decreases monotonically with increasing x from about 500 K for the undoped La2CuO4 to 0 K for x 0.22, i.e., the tetragonal phase becomes stable for x 0.22 even at lowest temperatures. Superconductivity has been observed for 0.05 <= x 0.25 with a maximum T_{c} at x 0.15 of about 36 - 38 K for LSCO (Ref. 2) and 28 - 30 K for LBCO.3 The Ba-doped compound shows a strong suppression of T_{c} at x \simeq \frac{1}{8}, which has been linked to another structural phase transition from the LTO to a low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase observed in x-ray-diffraction (XRD) measurements.4 However, the LTO-LTT transition as well as anomalies in transport properties, e.g., resistivity,3,5 which result from the transition, occur in a fairly wide composition range,5,6 while the T_{c} suppression is strongly peaked at x \simeq \frac{1}{8}. It has been suggested that this suppression is caused by supercell formation in the LTT phase.1 LSCO also shows a small dip in T_{c} at x \simeq \frac{1}{8},2 but the LTT phase has not been observed so far. On the other hand, a detailed study of the interplay between the occurrence of an LTT phase and superconductivity in Nd-doped LSCO revealed, that no bulk superconductivity occurs in the LTT phase and, vice versa, "the onset of superconductivity seems to inhibit a structural phase transition."7

The influence of the HTT-LTO phase boundary on superconductivity was investigated by Takagi _et al._ who reported a sudden drop of the Meissner fraction near x = 0.2 for LSCO powder samples and concluded that superconductivity disappears if the system does not transform to the LTO phase.8 This behavior was quite unexpected since the HTT-LTO transition is a second-order transition, i.e., no structural change occurs at T_{\rm TO}, and band-structure calculations also predict little or no change of the electronic structure due to the orthorhombic distortion.9,10 Thermal expansion results of a LSCO single crystal with x = 0.13 measured both parallel and perpendicular to the CuO2 planes11 suggest that the evolution of the orthorhombic distortion is stopped by the onset of superconductivity, indicating that the orthorhombic distortion may be, in fact, detrimental for superconductivity (such behavior has been observed in _A_-15 compounds, for example, Nb3Sn and V3Si,12 and Chevrel phases13). This is in accord with high-pressure experiments in which the HTT phase was stabilized at lower doping by pressure up to 2 GPa.5 Here T_{c} increases linearly with pressure until the HTT phase is stabilized and then saturates. Bulk superconductivity in both tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of LSCO was also observed in subsequent studies.14,15

Besides the HTT-LTO transition two other structural anomalies have been observed in LSCO. Lang _et al._ investigated a series of single- and polycrystalline samples with different stoichiometry and observed structural instabilities at 36 K, i.e., at the T_{c} of the optimum doped material in each of the samples.16 Therefrom the authors draw the conclusion that the maximum T_{c} is limited by this instability. Recently, a lattice instability was observed for a transverse elastic constant, which begins to soften 20 K above T_{e}[17]. Further, ultrasonic measurements on LSCO single crystals [18, 19] revealed an anisotropic coupling of superconductivity to the lattice, i.e., the longitudinal elastic constant C_{33} softens discontinuously at T_{c} while for the constant C_{11} only a small slope change is seen.

In this paper we present measurements of the anisotropic thermal expansion of high-quality LSCO single crystals with x=0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 between 5 and 300 K, i.e., in both the under- and overdoped regime of the T_{c}(x)-phase diagram. We have successfully applied a simple _in situ_ technique to prevent the twinning of the samples in the orthorhombic phase, which allows us to study the coupling of superconductivity to the lattice in detail along all three crystallographic axes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first measurements on untwinned LSCO crystals. We show that the evolution of the structural transition is not simply arrested at T_{c}, which allows us to deduce all three uniaxial stress (dT_{c}/dp_{i}) and strain (dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}) dependences of T_{c} from the measured expansivity anomalies \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}) using the Ehrenfest relationship. Irrespective of Sr content, one obtains a very large negative pressure dependence dT_{c}/dp_{c} for pressure perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes. The in-plane pressure effects dT_{c}/dp_{a} and dT_{c}/dp_{b} are both positive and show a pronounced anisotropy for large x.

Single crystals of LSCO with x=0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 were grown by the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method (for details of experimental setup see Ref. [20]). Sr content was checked by electron probe microscopic analysis with an uncertainty of \Delta x\simeq0.01. The oxygen content of all samples was close to 4.0. dc magnetization experiments in a magnetic field of 10 Oe parallel to the c axis (shielding, zero-field cooled) showed almost perfect diamagnetism below T_{c} with sharp transitions of width less than 2 K for the superconducting samples (T_{c}=28.5, 36, and 29.5 K for x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) and no effect for x=0.3[20]. dc measurements of the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity between 5 and 800 K were also carried out and the results are reported elsewhere[20]. The linear thermal expansion was measured using a high-resolution capacitance dilatometer[21], where the temperature is varied continuously at constant rates of 10 mK/s on both cooling and heating. The actual size of the samples in these measurements was L\approx0.5 mm so that relative length changes of \Delta L/L\approx10^{-8}-10^{-9} could be resolved[21]. Detwinning of the samples was achieved by applying a moderate uniaxial stress of \sigma\approx20-40 MPa along one of the \langle110\rangle_{\mathrm{ter}} directions _while_ the crystal transforms from the HTT to the LTO structure. Since T_{\mathrm{TO}} is below room temperature for all investigated samples the stress has to be exerted _in situ_ by means of a small CuBe spring (cut from a 0.5-mm-thick CuBe sheet) in which the crystal was inserted (see inset Fig. 1).

Before we show our results a few remarks concerning the notation. The unit-cell vectors of the LTO cell are rotated by 45^{\circ} around the c axis with respect to the HTT cell, i.e., \langle110\rangle_{\mathrm{ter}}\cong\langle100\rangle_{\mathrm{ortho}}. In the following we use the orthorhombic notation and omit the index "ortho." We arbitrarily describe the [100] direction as the a axis, since in this direction the stress is exerted by the spring and the lattice parameter in this direction becomes shorter in the LTO phase than the lattice parameter along the [010] direction \doteq b axis as described below.

In Fig. 1, we show the linear thermal expansion \Delta L(T)/L_{\mathrm{300K}} along the in-plane directions [100] and [010] for the three superconducting samples. One observes a splitting of the linear thermal expansion below T_{\mathrm{TO}}\simeq280, 180, and 100 K for x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2, respectively, which leads to an orthorhombic distortion of the former tetragonal unit cell. The magnitude of the distortion at 10 K depends on the Sr content and decreases with x since T_{\mathrm{TO}} is shifted to lower temperatures. Our results agree well with the distortions deduced from XRD measurements[22] [e.g., 0.73% (this work) vs 0.8% (Ref. [22]) for x=0.1] and thus we conclude that the samples are nearly single-domain crystals.

Figure 2 reviews the linear thermal expansivities \alpha_{i}(T) along the three different crystal axes between 5 and 300 K. The onset of the orthorhombic splitting at T_{\mathrm{TO}} appears in form of two discontinuous anomalies of opposite sign in the expansivities \alpha_{a} and \alpha_{b}, i.e., the jumps \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{\mathrm{TO}})\equiv\alpha_{i}(T_{\mathrm{TO}})-\alpha_{i}(T_{\mathrm{TO}}^{+}) are positive for the a axis and negative for the b axis. The sharpness and the magnitude of these anomalies decrease with increasing x. The out-of-plane expansivities \alpha_{c} always show positive jumps at T_{\mathrm{TO}} due to an additional shrinking of the c axis resulting from the octahedra tilt. Since the anomalies arising from the onset of superconductivity are not well

Figure 1: Relative length change \Delta L(T)/L_{\mathrm{300K}} along the in-plane directions [100] and [010] for x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2. The anisotropy below T_{\mathrm{TO}} in the length change due to the orthorhombic distortion of the former tetragonal unit cell is clearly observed. T_{\mathrm{TO}} decreases with increasing x, as well as the magnitude of the orthorhombicity. The inset shows how the sample is inserted into the CuBe spring. The linear thermal expansion is measured in the vertical direction as indicated by the two pistons (horizontal bars), one of them is movable and shifts a capacitor plate when the sample expands or contracts.

  resolved in Fig. 2, we show the expansivities in the vicinity of T_{c} in Figs. 3 and 4 in more detail. Figure 4 exhibits just the anomalies at T_{c}, which were obtained by subtracting a smooth background (approximated by a cubic spline of the data excluding a 30-K wide region centered at T_{c}) from the data shown in Fig. 3. From Figs. 3 and 4 it is evident that \alpha_{c} exhibits large negative jumps at T_{c}, the magnitude of which increase with increasing x. On the other hand, the anomalies \Delta\alpha_{a} and \Delta\alpha_{b} are both positive for all x. While \Delta\alpha_{a} remains small and nearly constant, \Delta\alpha_{b} clearly increases with increasing x. The magnitudes of the \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}) jumps were estimated by adding an "area-conserving" idealized second-order discontinuity to the anomalies in Fig. 4 and are listed in Table 1. Note that the influence of fluctuations is not analyzed. Besides the jumps at T_{c} and T_{\rm TO}, no other reproducible expansion anomalies were observed in the present experiments. However, in measurements in which the crystals were not detunbinned, we frequently observed instabilities between 40 and 60 K [23], which, however, were not reproducible in detail. In one case the sample shortened a few micrometers in discrete steps in this temperature interval. The fact that these effects are seen only in twinned samples suggests that they may be related to the relaxation of twin-induced internal stresses.

The overall shapes of the \alpha_{i}(T) curves and the anomalies at T_{c} for the x\!=\!0.15 crystal agree well with the observations of Braden _et al._[11] for a _twinned_ single crystal (x\!=\!0.13). Our results, however, show that the response at T_{c} cannot simply be explained by the freezing-in of the order parameter of the structural phase transition as suggested in Ref. [11]. In such a freezing scenario [see, e.g., the behavior in A-15 (Ref. [12]] and Chevrel [13] superconductors), the expansivity is expected to return to a value typical of the nonstructurally distorted material, which in the present case can be approximated by the expansivity of the tetragonal x\!=\!0.3 sample. Figure 3 clearly shows that the structural transition is not arrested at T_{c} since the expansivities do not jump back to the x\!=\!0.3 values (indicated by dashed [001] and dotted lines [100]_{\rm tetr}). In fact, \alpha_{a}(T_{c}) jumps away from and \alpha_{c}(T_{c}) jumps beyond the expected values. In the following we calculate the uniaxial stress dependences of T_{c} from the expansion anomalies at T_{c} using the thermodynamic Ehrenfest relationship

\[\frac{dT_{c}}{dp_{i}}=V_{\rm mol}\cdot\Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c})\cdot\left[\frac{ \Delta C_{p}(T_{c})}{T_{c}}\right]^{-1}.\] (1)

As will be shown, the calculated values agree well with directly measured c-axis uniaxial stress experiments [24] and also with uniaxial strain dependences deduced from the

Figure 3: Linear thermal expansivities of the superconducting samples in the vicinity of T_{c}, which is indicated by the vertical lines. Also shown are the expansivity of the overdoped (x\!=\!0.3) tetragonal sample along the [001] (dashed lines) and [100]_{\rm tetr} (dotted lines) directions.

Figure 2: Linear thermal expansivities \alpha\!=\!d\ln\!L(T)/dT for x\!=\!0.1, 0.15, and 0.20 along the [100], [010], and [001] directions. For comparison we also show the expansivity of the overdoped sample (x\!=\!0.3), which remains tetragonal and nonsuperconducting at least down to 5 K, along the [001] and the [100]_{\rm tetr} directions.

  ultrasound measurements.[18, 19] This thermodynamic consistency provides further evidence that the expansion anomalies at T_{c} are not due to the freezing-in of the structural order parameter as observed in _A_-15 or Chevrel superconductors, since for these substances the Ehrenfest relationship has been shown to be invalid.[13, 25]

For calculation of the uniaxial pressure effects dT_{c}/dp_{i} via Eq. (1) we need the discontinuities \Delta C_{p}(T_{c})/T_{c} in the specific heat. Continuous heating adiabatic calorimetry on the sample with x\!=\!0.15 at our institute revealed a jump of 7.5\!\pm\!1.5 mJ/mol K^{2}. This value is in good agreement with data of Loram and Mirza,[26] who used a differential technique to obtain the electronic specific heat of polycrystalline LSCO samples over the whole superconducting range from 0.05\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!0.25. Since the other single crystals are too small to be measured with our calorimeter we use the data from Ref. 26 for x\!=\!0.1 and 0.2.

Table 1 summarizes all values of \Delta\sigma_{i}(T_{c}), \Delta C_{p}(T_{c})/T_{c}, and dT_{c}/dp_{i} and Fig. 5 visualizes the anisotropy of the uniaxial stress effects. Uniaxial stress perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes is expected to strongly decrease T_{c} (dT_{c}/dp_{c}\!\leq\!\!0) for all x values. This result is consistent with uniaxial stress experiments on _c_-axis-aligned grains by Motoi _et al.[24]. The in-plane pressure effects dT_{c}/dp_{a} and dT_{c}/dp_{b} are both positive. For x\!=\!0.1 both effects are nearly equal, but with increasing x, dT_{c}/dp_{b} increases while dT_{c}/dp_{a} decreases, i.e., the anisotropy of in-plane pressure effects is raised with higher doping. We have further calculated the uniaxial strain dependences of dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i} which determine the change of T_{c} on variation of a single lattice parameter leaving all the other distances of the structure perpendicular to the strain direction unaltered. The dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i} are given by

\[\frac{dT_{c}}{d\varepsilon_{i}}=\sum_{j=1}^{3}C_{ij}\frac{dT_{c}}{dp_{j}}\ \ ,\] (2)

where C_{ij} are the elastic constants. We used C_{ij} values of the (orthorhombic) undoped La_{2}CuO_{4} compound from Ref. 27. The anisotropy of the uniaxial pressure effects is essentially reproduced in the dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i} values (see Table 1). Our uniaxial strain results are in good agreement with values deduced from ultrasonic experiments on twinned crystals[18, 19] (values in parentheses in Table 1), from which, however, only the magnitude (not the sign) of the uniaxial strain dependences can be determined.

There are several things worth noting concerning the uniaxial stress (strain) dependences. First, independent of

Figure 4: Expansivity jumps \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}). The jumps are extracted by separating a smooth background (cubic spline) from the original data, i.e., \alpha^{\bullet}\!=\!\alpha\!-\!\alpha_{\rm spline} (see text). The magnitude of \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}) is estimated by an idealized discontinuity and an area-conserving construction, as indicated in the figure.

  the degree of doping the magnitudes of the dT_{c}/dp_{i} are very large and largely cancel for hydrostatic pressure[28; 41] due to both positive and negative dT_{c}/dp_{i} terms, as was also found for optimized YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} (YBCO).[29; 30] This demonstrates that the LSCO structure is far from being optimal for a high-T_{c} value (this may also explain the relatively low T_{c} for this compound in comparison to the structurally similar (i.e., one CuO_{2} plane Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6} and HgBa_{2}CuO_{4} structures which have much higher T_{c} values (\approx 90 K). Also of interest is the a, b anisotropy of dT_{c}/dp_{i}, which is largest for x = 0.2 and absent for x = 0.1 (see Fig. 5 and Table I). This behavior is quite unexpected since the structure becomes more isotropic (smaller orthorhombic distortion, see Fig. 1) as x increases from 0.1 to 0.2. We have no explanation for this puzzling behavior, but feel this is important and demonstrates the complexity of these materials.

There have only been a few attempts to calculate the uniaxial stress dependence of T_{c} of HTSC.[31]^{-}[33] For LSCO (x = 0.15) Goddard[31] predicts using the magnon pairing theory that T_{c} is increased by 14 K, if the a, b plane is compressed by 2% (the model considers no in-plane anisotropy) and is decreased by 1 K for a 2% compression of the c axis. This agrees almost too well with our a, b results from which we calculate an increase of T_{c} by 13 K for 2% compression, however, the predicted negative c-axis strain effect is, although the sign is correct, by 1 order of magnitude smaller than our result.

It is instructive to compare the present results with those for YBCO, which also exhibits a maximum in T_{c} as a function of doping, similar to the T_{c} maximum in LSCO. In YBCO the pressure-induced charge-transfer model[34] has been argued to explain at least part of the pressure dependence of T_{c}.[29; 35] In contrast to YBCO, in which T_{c} is raised by c-axis stress when the system is underdoped (8 > 0.1) and lowered when overdoped,[35] LSCO exhibits a large and nearly composition-independent negative c-axis stress dependence. This shows that the pressure-induced charge-transfer model is not applicable for LSCO, which is not too surprising since the LSCO structure lacks the charge reservoir (chains in YBCO) from which charge can be transferred to the CuO_{2} planes and, at least for hydrostatic pressure, no charge transfer has been observed experimentally.[36] This shows that a mechanism other than pressure-induced charge transfer is responsible for the large T_{c} changes under stress in LSCO.

Perhaps, one starting point for understanding the pressure effects in LSCO are observations from polarization-dependent x-ray-absorption (XAS) measurements[37; 38] from which it has been concluded that the hole concentration on the apex oxygen sites (O2p_{z}) increases strongly above the optimum Sr concentration of x \approx 0.15. This suggests that T_{c} decreases with increasing site population on O2p_{z} sites supporting theoretical considerations which claim suppression of T_{c} by holes on apex sites.[39] One would have to prove by experiment whether a transfer of charge from the in-plane oxygen sites (O2p_{\sigma}) to the O2p_{z} sites occurs under uniaxial pressure perpendicular to the planes.

In summary, we have measured the anisotropy of the linear thermal expansivities of untwinned LSCO single crystals in order to study the coupling of superconductivity to the orthorhombic structural distortion and to determine the uniaxial stress (strain) effects on T_{c}. We found that stress perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes strongly decreases T_{c}, while stress parallel to the planes always raises T_{c}. Furthermore a pronounced anisotropy evolves between dT_{c}/dp_{a} and dT_{c}/dp_{b} when the Sr content increases. At x = 0.1 both effects are of nearly equal magnitude, but then the b-axis effect increases, while the a-axis effect decreases. Although the uniaxial stress effects are very large, they almost cancel each other, so that the hydrostatic pressure dependence is only weak. The anisotropy of the stress effects is essentially reproduced in the uniaxial strain dependences dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}. The consistency of our calculated values with stress and ultrasonic experiments[18; 19; 24] makes it unlikely that the anomalies \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}) are substantially influenced by a coupling of superconductivity to the structural HTT-LTO phase transition (as it is the case in A-15 compounds). Only a few theoretical approaches[33]^{-}[35] to describe the uniaxial stress effects on T_{c} in HTSC exist and none of them predicts _consistently_ the very different effects in LSCO, YBCO, and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8},[40] i.e., explains why these materials respond so differently to subtle structural deformations. We hope our experimental results will stimulate further theoretical work about the influence of uniaxial stresses and strains on superconductivity in HTSC.

###### Abstract

We have carried out high-resolution dilatometry experiments on a series of high-quality single crystals of La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 with various Sr content on both the under- and overdoped side of the T_{c}(x) phase diagram. A simple _in situ_ technique was applied to prevent the usual twinning of the samples in the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase, which allows us to study the full anisotropy of the thermal expansion of the LTO phase. From the anomalies in the linear expansivities \Delta\alpha_{i} (_i_ = a,_b_,_c_) at T_{c} we deduce all three uniaxial stress (dT_{c}/dp_{i}) and strain (dT_{c}/d\epsilon_{i}) dependences, which turn out to be large and almost cancel for hydrostatic pressure.

Much experimental and theoretical work has been carried out in order to study the correlation between structure and superconductivity of CuO-based high-temperature superconductors (HTSC). Of particular interest are the doped lanthanum cuprates La2-_x_Sr_CuO4 (_M_ = Sr, Ba) because these compounds exhibit a variety of phase transitions at low temperatures.1 Both the Sr-doped (LSCO) and Ba-doped (LBCO) compounds undergo a second-order structural phase transition from a high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) to a low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase, where the CuO6 octahedra tilt around an (110)tetr direction of the tetragonal unit cell. Corner-shared octahedra tilt in opposing directions. The transition temperature T_{\rm TO} decreases monotonically with increasing x from about 500 K for the undoped La2CuO4 to 0 K for x 0.22, i.e., the tetragonal phase becomes stable for x 0.22 even at lowest temperatures. Superconductivity has been observed for 0.05 <= x 0.25 with a maximum T_{c} at x 0.15 of about 36 - 38 K for LSCO (Ref. 2) and 28 - 30 K for LBCO.3 The Ba-doped compound shows a strong suppression of T_{c} at x \simeq \frac{1}{8}, which has been linked to another structural phase transition from the LTO to a low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase observed in x-ray-diffraction (XRD) measurements.4 However, the LTO-LTT transition as well as anomalies in transport properties, e.g., resistivity,3,5 which result from the transition, occur in a fairly wide composition range,5,6 while the T_{c} suppression is strongly peaked at x \simeq \frac{1}{8}. It has been suggested that this suppression is caused by supercell formation in the LTT phase.1 LSCO also shows a small dip in T_{c} at x \simeq \frac{1}{8},2 but the LTT phase has not been observed so far. On the other hand, a detailed study of the interplay between the occurrence of an LTT phase and superconductivity in Nd-doped LSCO revealed, that no bulk superconductivity occurs in the LTT phase and, vice versa, "the onset of superconductivity seems to inhibit a structural phase transition."7

The influence of the HTT-LTO phase boundary on superconductivity was investigated by Takagi _et al._ who reported a sudden drop of the Meissner fraction near x = 0.2 for LSCO powder samples and concluded that superconductivity disappears if the system does not transform to the LTO phase.8 This behavior was quite unexpected since the HTT-LTO transition is a second-order transition, i.e., no structural change occurs at T_{\rm TO}, and band-structure calculations also predict little or no change of the electronic structure due to the orthorhombic distortion.9,10 Thermal expansion results of a LSCO single crystal with x = 0.13 measured both parallel and perpendicular to the CuO2 planes11 suggest that the evolution of the orthorhombic distortion is stopped by the onset of superconductivity, indicating that the orthorhombic distortion may be, in fact, detrimental for superconductivity (such behavior has been observed in _A_-15 compounds, for example, Nb3Sn and V3Si,12 and Chevrel phases13). This is in accord with high-pressure experiments in which the HTT phase was stabilized at lower doping by pressure up to 2 GPa.5 Here T_{c} increases linearly with pressure until the HTT phase is stabilized and then saturates. Bulk superconductivity in both tetragonal and orthorhombic phases of LSCO was also observed in subsequent studies.14,15

Besides the HTT-LTO transition two other structural anomalies have been observed in LSCO. Lang _et al._ investigated a series of single- and polycrystalline samples with different stoichiometry and observed structural instabilities at 36 K, i.e., at the T_{c} of the optimum doped material in each of the samples.16 Therefrom the authors draw the conclusion that the maximum T_{c} is limited by this instability. Recently, a lattice instability was observed for a transverse elastic constant, which begins to soften 20 K above T_{e}[17]. Further, ultrasonic measurements on LSCO single crystals [18, 19] revealed an anisotropic coupling of superconductivity to the lattice, i.e., the longitudinal elastic constant C_{33} softens discontinuously at T_{c} while for the constant C_{11} only a small slope change is seen.

In this paper we present measurements of the anisotropic thermal expansion of high-quality LSCO single crystals with x=0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 between 5 and 300 K, i.e., in both the under- and overdoped regime of the T_{c}(x)-phase diagram. We have successfully applied a simple _in situ_ technique to prevent the twinning of the samples in the orthorhombic phase, which allows us to study the coupling of superconductivity to the lattice in detail along all three crystallographic axes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first measurements on untwinned LSCO crystals. We show that the evolution of the structural transition is not simply arrested at T_{c}, which allows us to deduce all three uniaxial stress (dT_{c}/dp_{i}) and strain (dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}) dependences of T_{c} from the measured expansivity anomalies \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}) using the Ehrenfest relationship. Irrespective of Sr content, one obtains a very large negative pressure dependence dT_{c}/dp_{c} for pressure perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes. The in-plane pressure effects dT_{c}/dp_{a} and dT_{c}/dp_{b} are both positive and show a pronounced anisotropy for large x.

Single crystals of LSCO with x=0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 were grown by the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method (for details of experimental setup see Ref. [20]). Sr content was checked by electron probe microscopic analysis with an uncertainty of \Delta x\simeq0.01. The oxygen content of all samples was close to 4.0. dc magnetization experiments in a magnetic field of 10 Oe parallel to the c axis (shielding, zero-field cooled) showed almost perfect diamagnetism below T_{c} with sharp transitions of width less than 2 K for the superconducting samples (T_{c}=28.5, 36, and 29.5 K for x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) and no effect for x=0.3[20]. dc measurements of the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity between 5 and 800 K were also carried out and the results are reported elsewhere[20]. The linear thermal expansion was measured using a high-resolution capacitance dilatometer[21], where the temperature is varied continuously at constant rates of 10 mK/s on both cooling and heating. The actual size of the samples in these measurements was L\approx0.5 mm so that relative length changes of \Delta L/L\approx10^{-8}-10^{-9} could be resolved[21]. Detwinning of the samples was achieved by applying a moderate uniaxial stress of \sigma\approx20-40 MPa along one of the \langle110\rangle_{\mathrm{ter}} directions _while_ the crystal transforms from the HTT to the LTO structure. Since T_{\mathrm{TO}} is below room temperature for all investigated samples the stress has to be exerted _in situ_ by means of a small CuBe spring (cut from a 0.5-mm-thick CuBe sheet) in which the crystal was inserted (see inset Fig. 1).

Before we show our results a few remarks concerning the notation. The unit-cell vectors of the LTO cell are rotated by 45^{\circ} around the c axis with respect to the HTT cell, i.e., \langle110\rangle_{\mathrm{ter}}\cong\langle100\rangle_{\mathrm{ortho}}. In the following we use the orthorhombic notation and omit the index "ortho." We arbitrarily describe the [100] direction as the a axis, since in this direction the stress is exerted by the spring and the lattice parameter in this direction becomes shorter in the LTO phase than the lattice parameter along the [010] direction \doteq b axis as described below.

In Fig. 1, we show the linear thermal expansion \Delta L(T)/L_{\mathrm{300K}} along the in-plane directions [100] and [010] for the three superconducting samples. One observes a splitting of the linear thermal expansion below T_{\mathrm{TO}}\simeq280, 180, and 100 K for x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2, respectively, which leads to an orthorhombic distortion of the former tetragonal unit cell. The magnitude of the distortion at 10 K depends on the Sr content and decreases with x since T_{\mathrm{TO}} is shifted to lower temperatures. Our results agree well with the distortions deduced from XRD measurements[22] [e.g., 0.73% (this work) vs 0.8% (Ref. [22]) for x=0.1] and thus we conclude that the samples are nearly single-domain crystals.

Figure 2 reviews the linear thermal expansivities \alpha_{i}(T) along the three different crystal axes between 5 and 300 K. The onset of the orthorhombic splitting at T_{\mathrm{TO}} appears in form of two discontinuous anomalies of opposite sign in the expansivities \alpha_{a} and \alpha_{b}, i.e., the jumps \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{\mathrm{TO}})\equiv\alpha_{i}(T_{\mathrm{TO}})-\alpha_{i}(T_{\mathrm{TO}}^{+}) are positive for the a axis and negative for the b axis. The sharpness and the magnitude of these anomalies decrease with increasing x. The out-of-plane expansivities \alpha_{c} always show positive jumps at T_{\mathrm{TO}} due to an additional shrinking of the c axis resulting from the octahedra tilt. Since the anomalies arising from the onset of superconductivity are not well

Figure 1: Relative length change \Delta L(T)/L_{\mathrm{300K}} along the in-plane directions [100] and [010] for x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2. The anisotropy below T_{\mathrm{TO}} in the length change due to the orthorhombic distortion of the former tetragonal unit cell is clearly observed. T_{\mathrm{TO}} decreases with increasing x, as well as the magnitude of the orthorhombicity. The inset shows how the sample is inserted into the CuBe spring. The linear thermal expansion is measured in the vertical direction as indicated by the two pistons (horizontal bars), one of them is movable and shifts a capacitor plate when the sample expands or contracts.

  resolved in Fig. 2, we show the expansivities in the vicinity of T_{c} in Figs. 3 and 4 in more detail. Figure 4 exhibits just the anomalies at T_{c}, which were obtained by subtracting a smooth background (approximated by a cubic spline of the data excluding a 30-K wide region centered at T_{c}) from the data shown in Fig. 3. From Figs. 3 and 4 it is evident that \alpha_{c} exhibits large negative jumps at T_{c}, the magnitude of which increase with increasing x. On the other hand, the anomalies \Delta\alpha_{a} and \Delta\alpha_{b} are both positive for all x. While \Delta\alpha_{a} remains small and nearly constant, \Delta\alpha_{b} clearly increases with increasing x. The magnitudes of the \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}) jumps were estimated by adding an "area-conserving" idealized second-order discontinuity to the anomalies in Fig. 4 and are listed in Table 1. Note that the influence of fluctuations is not analyzed. Besides the jumps at T_{c} and T_{\rm TO}, no other reproducible expansion anomalies were observed in the present experiments. However, in measurements in which the crystals were not detunbinned, we frequently observed instabilities between 40 and 60 K [23], which, however, were not reproducible in detail. In one case the sample shortened a few micrometers in discrete steps in this temperature interval. The fact that these effects are seen only in twinned samples suggests that they may be related to the relaxation of twin-induced internal stresses.

The overall shapes of the \alpha_{i}(T) curves and the anomalies at T_{c} for the x\!=\!0.15 crystal agree well with the observations of Braden _et al._[11] for a _twinned_ single crystal (x\!=\!0.13). Our results, however, show that the response at T_{c} cannot simply be explained by the freezing-in of the order parameter of the structural phase transition as suggested in Ref. [11]. In such a freezing scenario [see, e.g., the behavior in A-15 (Ref. [12]] and Chevrel [13] superconductors), the expansivity is expected to return to a value typical of the nonstructurally distorted material, which in the present case can be approximated by the expansivity of the tetragonal x\!=\!0.3 sample. Figure 3 clearly shows that the structural transition is not arrested at T_{c} since the expansivities do not jump back to the x\!=\!0.3 values (indicated by dashed [001] and dotted lines [100]_{\rm tetr}). In fact, \alpha_{a}(T_{c}) jumps away from and \alpha_{c}(T_{c}) jumps beyond the expected values. In the following we calculate the uniaxial stress dependences of T_{c} from the expansion anomalies at T_{c} using the thermodynamic Ehrenfest relationship

\[\frac{dT_{c}}{dp_{i}}=V_{\rm mol}\cdot\Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c})\cdot\left[\frac{ \Delta C_{p}(T_{c})}{T_{c}}\right]^{-1}.\] (1)

As will be shown, the calculated values agree well with directly measured c-axis uniaxial stress experiments [24] and also with uniaxial strain dependences deduced from the

Figure 3: Linear thermal expansivities of the superconducting samples in the vicinity of T_{c}, which is indicated by the vertical lines. Also shown are the expansivity of the overdoped (x\!=\!0.3) tetragonal sample along the [001] (dashed lines) and [100]_{\rm tetr} (dotted lines) directions.

Figure 2: Linear thermal expansivities \alpha\!=\!d\ln\!L(T)/dT for x\!=\!0.1, 0.15, and 0.20 along the [100], [010], and [001] directions. For comparison we also show the expansivity of the overdoped sample (x\!=\!0.3), which remains tetragonal and nonsuperconducting at least down to 5 K, along the [001] and the [100]_{\rm tetr} directions.

  ultrasound measurements.[18, 19] This thermodynamic consistency provides further evidence that the expansion anomalies at T_{c} are not due to the freezing-in of the structural order parameter as observed in _A_-15 or Chevrel superconductors, since for these substances the Ehrenfest relationship has been shown to be invalid.[13, 25]

For calculation of the uniaxial pressure effects dT_{c}/dp_{i} via Eq. (1) we need the discontinuities \Delta C_{p}(T_{c})/T_{c} in the specific heat. Continuous heating adiabatic calorimetry on the sample with x\!=\!0.15 at our institute revealed a jump of 7.5\!\pm\!1.5 mJ/mol K^{2}. This value is in good agreement with data of Loram and Mirza,[26] who used a differential technique to obtain the electronic specific heat of polycrystalline LSCO samples over the whole superconducting range from 0.05\!\leq\!x\!\leq\!0.25. Since the other single crystals are too small to be measured with our calorimeter we use the data from Ref. 26 for x\!=\!0.1 and 0.2.

Table 1 summarizes all values of \Delta\sigma_{i}(T_{c}), \Delta C_{p}(T_{c})/T_{c}, and dT_{c}/dp_{i} and Fig. 5 visualizes the anisotropy of the uniaxial stress effects. Uniaxial stress perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes is expected to strongly decrease T_{c} (dT_{c}/dp_{c}\!\leq\!\!0) for all x values. This result is consistent with uniaxial stress experiments on _c_-axis-aligned grains by Motoi _et al.[24]. The in-plane pressure effects dT_{c}/dp_{a} and dT_{c}/dp_{b} are both positive. For x\!=\!0.1 both effects are nearly equal, but with increasing x, dT_{c}/dp_{b} increases while dT_{c}/dp_{a} decreases, i.e., the anisotropy of in-plane pressure effects is raised with higher doping. We have further calculated the uniaxial strain dependences of dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i} which determine the change of T_{c} on variation of a single lattice parameter leaving all the other distances of the structure perpendicular to the strain direction unaltered. The dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i} are given by

\[\frac{dT_{c}}{d\varepsilon_{i}}=\sum_{j=1}^{3}C_{ij}\frac{dT_{c}}{dp_{j}}\ \ ,\] (2)

where C_{ij} are the elastic constants. We used C_{ij} values of the (orthorhombic) undoped La_{2}CuO_{4} compound from Ref. 27. The anisotropy of the uniaxial pressure effects is essentially reproduced in the dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i} values (see Table 1). Our uniaxial strain results are in good agreement with values deduced from ultrasonic experiments on twinned crystals[18, 19] (values in parentheses in Table 1), from which, however, only the magnitude (not the sign) of the uniaxial strain dependences can be determined.

There are several things worth noting concerning the uniaxial stress (strain) dependences. First, independent of

Figure 4: Expansivity jumps \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}). The jumps are extracted by separating a smooth background (cubic spline) from the original data, i.e., \alpha^{\bullet}\!=\!\alpha\!-\!\alpha_{\rm spline} (see text). The magnitude of \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}) is estimated by an idealized discontinuity and an area-conserving construction, as indicated in the figure.

  the degree of doping the magnitudes of the dT_{c}/dp_{i} are very large and largely cancel for hydrostatic pressure[28; 41] due to both positive and negative dT_{c}/dp_{i} terms, as was also found for optimized YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{x} (YBCO).[29; 30] This demonstrates that the LSCO structure is far from being optimal for a high-T_{c} value (this may also explain the relatively low T_{c} for this compound in comparison to the structurally similar (i.e., one CuO_{2} plane Tl_{2}Ba_{2}CuO_{6} and HgBa_{2}CuO_{4} structures which have much higher T_{c} values (\approx 90 K). Also of interest is the a, b anisotropy of dT_{c}/dp_{i}, which is largest for x = 0.2 and absent for x = 0.1 (see Fig. 5 and Table I). This behavior is quite unexpected since the structure becomes more isotropic (smaller orthorhombic distortion, see Fig. 1) as x increases from 0.1 to 0.2. We have no explanation for this puzzling behavior, but feel this is important and demonstrates the complexity of these materials.

There have only been a few attempts to calculate the uniaxial stress dependence of T_{c} of HTSC.[31]^{-}[33] For LSCO (x = 0.15) Goddard[31] predicts using the magnon pairing theory that T_{c} is increased by 14 K, if the a, b plane is compressed by 2% (the model considers no in-plane anisotropy) and is decreased by 1 K for a 2% compression of the c axis. This agrees almost too well with our a, b results from which we calculate an increase of T_{c} by 13 K for 2% compression, however, the predicted negative c-axis strain effect is, although the sign is correct, by 1 order of magnitude smaller than our result.

It is instructive to compare the present results with those for YBCO, which also exhibits a maximum in T_{c} as a function of doping, similar to the T_{c} maximum in LSCO. In YBCO the pressure-induced charge-transfer model[34] has been argued to explain at least part of the pressure dependence of T_{c}.[29; 35] In contrast to YBCO, in which T_{c} is raised by c-axis stress when the system is underdoped (8 > 0.1) and lowered when overdoped,[35] LSCO exhibits a large and nearly composition-independent negative c-axis stress dependence. This shows that the pressure-induced charge-transfer model is not applicable for LSCO, which is not too surprising since the LSCO structure lacks the charge reservoir (chains in YBCO) from which charge can be transferred to the CuO_{2} planes and, at least for hydrostatic pressure, no charge transfer has been observed experimentally.[36] This shows that a mechanism other than pressure-induced charge transfer is responsible for the large T_{c} changes under stress in LSCO.

Perhaps, one starting point for understanding the pressure effects in LSCO are observations from polarization-dependent x-ray-absorption (XAS) measurements[37; 38] from which it has been concluded that the hole concentration on the apex oxygen sites (O2p_{z}) increases strongly above the optimum Sr concentration of x \approx 0.15. This suggests that T_{c} decreases with increasing site population on O2p_{z} sites supporting theoretical considerations which claim suppression of T_{c} by holes on apex sites.[39] One would have to prove by experiment whether a transfer of charge from the in-plane oxygen sites (O2p_{\sigma}) to the O2p_{z} sites occurs under uniaxial pressure perpendicular to the planes.

In summary, we have measured the anisotropy of the linear thermal expansivities of untwinned LSCO single crystals in order to study the coupling of superconductivity to the orthorhombic structural distortion and to determine the uniaxial stress (strain) effects on T_{c}. We found that stress perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes strongly decreases T_{c}, while stress parallel to the planes always raises T_{c}. Furthermore a pronounced anisotropy evolves between dT_{c}/dp_{a} and dT_{c}/dp_{b} when the Sr content increases. At x = 0.1 both effects are of nearly equal magnitude, but then the b-axis effect increases, while the a-axis effect decreases. Although the uniaxial stress effects are very large, they almost cancel each other, so that the hydrostatic pressure dependence is only weak. The anisotropy of the stress effects is essentially reproduced in the uniaxial strain dependences dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}. The consistency of our calculated values with stress and ultrasonic experiments[18; 19; 24] makes it unlikely that the anomalies \Delta\alpha_{i}(T_{c}) are substantially influenced by a coupling of superconductivity to the structural HTT-LTO phase transition (as it is the case in A-15 compounds). Only a few theoretical approaches[33]^{-}[35] to describe the uniaxial stress effects on T_{c} in HTSC exist and none of them predicts _consistently_ the very different effects in LSCO, YBCO, and YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8},[40] i.e., explains why these materials respond so differently to subtle structural deformations. We hope our experimental results will stimulate further theoretical work about the influence of uniaxial stresses and strains on superconductivity in HTSC.
