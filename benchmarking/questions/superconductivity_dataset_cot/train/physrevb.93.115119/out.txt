###### Abstract

Irradiation with 4 MeV protons was used to systematically introduce defects in single crystals of the iron-arsenide superconductor BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2}, x=0.33. The effect of disorder on the low-temperature behavior of the London penetration depth \lambda(T) and transition temperature T_{c} was investigated. In nearly optimally doped samples with T_{c}\sim 29 K, signatures of a superconducting gap with nodes were observed. Contrary to previous reports on electron-irradiated crystals, we do not see a disorder-driven lifting of accidental nodes, and we observe that proton-induced defects are weaker pair breakers than electron-induced defects. We attribute our findings to anisotropic electron scattering caused by proton irradiation defects.

  observed with electron irradiation in Ref. [26] in a similar temperature range. Our study suggests that defects induced by protons are weaker pair breakers than those created by electrons and that anisotropy strongly modifies the effect of impurity scattering on the superconducting gap.

_Experimental details_. Single crystals of high-purity BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} were grown using a self-flux method, and crystals were cut into 300\times 400\mum^{2} rectangles approximately 20\mum thick. Three crystals with nearly optimal doping (x=0.33) were chosen for examination, two with T_{c}\sim 28.7 K and one with T_{c}\sim 29.6 K. Additionally, a larger bar (550\mum\times930\mum \times70\mum) from a different batch with T_{c}\sim 25 K and a room-temperature resistivity of 120\mu\Omega cm was selected for transport measurements. This resistivity value is comparable to reported results [32,33]. All samples were repeatedly irradiated at the tandem Van de Grawl accelerator at Western Michigan University with 4 MeV protons, with characterization performed in between successive irradiation runs. A gold foil was used to disperse the beam to ensure a uniform beam spot over the samples, and the irradiation stage was cooled to \sim-10^{\circ} C during irradiation. TRIM calculations for our irradiation geometry show that proton implantation is negligible [34].

_Results and discussion_. For the three samples, we determined the transition temperature (T_{c}) from the magnetization data, acquired on a custom SQUID magnetometer; the value of T_{c} is taken at the half-height of the transition; see the inset of Fig. 3(a). We find a strong suppression of T_{c} with increasing irradiation dose. The variation of T_{c}, normalized to the respective transition temperature of the pristine sample (T_{c0}), as a function of irradiation dose is shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The transition temperature is suppressed linearly with increasing dose, even at a fairly high dose of 50\times 10^{16}p/cm^{2}. The fact that all of the samples follow this trend indicates that the effect of irradiation-induced defects on electron scattering and pair breaking is the same in all of the samples even though the initial T_{c} values are slightly different. The initial transition width observed on all three crystals is sharp, indicating high-quality single-phase material. The transitions remain sharp with increasing total proton dose, demonstrating that the crystal remains single phase over the entire range of irradiation. Furthermore, the change in T_{c} never saturates with increasing dose, showing that the system remains dominated by interband scattering.

Resistivity measurements were performed in a continuous flow liquid helium cryostat with a standard 4-point contact technique. The temperature dependence of the resistivity is plotted for several irradiation levels in the inset of Fig. 2. Following the initial irradiation dose, subsequent irradiations do not change the curvature of \rho vs T, but only offset the curves, consistent with an increase in \rho_{0}. Figure 2 shows the change in the extrapolated zero-temperature resistivity with irradiation dose. This quantity is directly related to the scattering processes caused by the irradiation-induced defects. We observe nearly linear behavior for small doses, indicating a linear increase in the number of defects for lower doses, followed by a sublinear growth and tendency towards saturation at higher doses [35].

For the transport sample, the reduced T_{c} versus increase in \rho_{0} was directly taken from the transport measurements. The effective increase in \rho_{0} for the SQUID samples had to be inferred by fitting a parabolic function to the \rho_{0} data, Fig. 2. By plotting the SQUID sample dose levels on this curve, the effective increase in \rho_{0} for all dose levels could be estimated, resulting in the data shown in Fig. 1.

The initial decrease in T_{c} with respect to increasing \Delta\rho_{0} is approximately 0.15 K/\mu\Omega cm. This T_{c} suppression

The legend indicates the initial T_{c} of each crystal before irradiation. The line is a guide to the eye. The inset shows the normalized T_{c} from dc SQUID magnetization (filled shapes) and transport measurements (stars) as a function of irradiation dose.

  is weaker as compared to the rate of \sim0.3 K/\mu\Omega cm obtained with electron irradiation [26]. A survey of published data reveals that the T_{c} suppression due to electron irradiation is in general larger than with proton irradiation. In isovalently doped Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} electron irradiation induced T_{c} suppression at the rate [36] of \sim0.35 K/\mu\Omega cm whereas for optimally doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} the rate [37] is \sim0.2 K/\mu\Omega cm; the rate of suppression is higher in underdoped samples. In contrast, proton irradiation of optimally doped Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}[35, 38] and Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[39] yielded T_{c} suppression of 0.16 K/\mu\Omega cm and 0.1 K/\mu\Omega cm, respectively. The rate of suppression is a direct measure of pair-breaking scattering, and low values of the strength of the suppression rate suggest that the defects generated by proton irradiation act as weaker pair breakers than the defects coming from electron irradiation.

The low-temperature variation of the penetration depth \Delta\lambda(T) provides direct information about the low-energy quasiparticle excitation spectrum. For three crystals, the magnetic penetration depth was measured with a custom tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) system operating at \sim14.5 MHz down to 500 mK. In this technique, the frequency shift \Delta f of the resonator is proportional to the change of the penetration depth, \Delta f=G\Delta\lambda, where the geometrical factor G depends on the sample volume and shape, and also the geometry of the resonator coil; G was determined for each sample using a standard procedure [40]. Figure 3(a) summarizes the evolution of the low-temperature TDO response of BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} crystals at various stages of proton irradiation. We illustrate in Fig. 3 the low-temperature power-law behavior of the penetration depth that is an indicator of gap nodes. This agrees with earlier work by Hashimoto _et al._ showing the presence of line nodes from thermal transport and penetration depth measurements [41, 42], and NMR studies by Nakai _et al._[43]. The temperature variations of the frequency shift at various irradiation stages can be fitted to the

Figure 3: Effect of increasing irradiation dose on the change in the resonator frequency (\Delta f) measured on a BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} single crystal with T_{c0}\sim 29 K. Panel (a) displays the evolution of \Delta f with increasing proton dose indicated in units of 10^{16}p/\mathrm{cm}^{2}; the curves are offset by 0.002 along the \gamma axis for clarity. The inset shows T_{c} decreasing with dose and how transitions remain sharp as dose increases in SQUID magnetization data. Panels (b), (c), and (d) show \Delta f data at zero, intermediate, and high dose, respectively, together with various fits. Data in (b) and (c) are well described by the HG function (red lines) whereas the high-dose data follow a T^{2} dependence. At no dose is it possible to fit the data with a BCS-like exponential dependence with a fixed (blue lines) or free (green) gap parameter. The same trends were observed in three crystals, and the data shown are characteristic of the whole set.

  Hirschfeld-Goldenfeld (HG) form [15], originally proposed for a d-wave superconductor with line nodes, \Delta\lambda=AT^{2}/(T+T^{*}), where T^{*} is a measure of disorder in the system and A is a fitting parameter which accounts for all the geometrical factors. For pristine samples, the penetration depth varies essentially linearly with temperature as shown in Fig. 3(b). The samples do show small intrinsic disorder, as evidenced by the finite, small value of T^{*}=0.04 K in the HG function. With increasing doses of irradiation, the value of T^{*} grows; see Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) and Table 1. The penetration depth can still be fitted with the HG function up until a critical dose, above which the penetration depth can only be fitted as T^{2}. We also note that the absence of an upturn in \Delta f at low temperatures shows that p-irradiation-induced defects are nonmagnetic [26, 44, 45].

In contrast to recent reports by Mizukami _et al._, at no dose level in any of our crystals do we observe the emergence of a full gap in our proton-irradiated samples even though we cover the same range of T_{c} suppression and the same measured temperature range as in Ref. [26]. A possible explanation lies in the different structure of electron and proton irradiation induced defects. Irradiation with MeV electrons produces predominantly low-energy recoils resulting in the formation of pairs of point defects (Frenkel pairs), whereas MeV-proton irradiation yields recoils with energies up to keV resulting in a mixture of point defects and small collision cascades [29]. Extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) work on proton-irradiated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} revealed anisotropic collision cascades of roughly 2-4 nm in size [46, 47]. At present, no such studies exist for BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2}. Although the details of the irradiation-induced defect structure will depend on the material at hand and on the preexisting defects, numerical simulations [48] using TRIM software [34] indicate that proton irradiation of BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} produces a mixture of point defects and nm-sized, possibly anisotropic, cascades. The scattering potential due to point defects is composed of essentially isotropic contributions from Fourier components with wave vectors spanning the entire range, including large wave vectors that span the Brillouin zone. These effectively mix the electron states on the hole and electron Fermi surface sheets causing suppression of T_{c}. In contrast, the cascades, owing to their extended size, are most likely to yield anisotropic scattering at selected wave vectors [49] and small-angle scattering, that is, intraband scattering. Both intraband and interband scattering contribute to the electrical resistance; however, interband scattering is dominant in pair breaking in an s_{\pm} superconductor. Thus, it is expected that the rate of suppression of T_{c} (with respect to increase in residual resistivity) due to proton irradiation is lower as not all defects contribute to interband pair breaking. Furthermore, since the isotropic mixing of states (as assumed in Refs. [19, 20, 25]) does not arise in the case of the extended cascades, it is conceivable that the node lifting is not complete in this case or that a complete gap is significantly smaller than in the corresponding case of electron irradiation such that it cannot be detected in our current temperature range.

In summary, we present measurements of the magnetization, resistivity, and magnetic penetration depth of pristine and proton-irradiated BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} crystals. Upon proton irradiation, T_{c} is continuously suppressed with the transitions staying sharp, and the residual resistivity is increased. The low-temperature variation of the penetration depth of the pristine samples is linear, indicative of line nodes in the superconducting gap. The evolution of the temperature dependence of the penetration depth with irradiation is well described by the Hirschfeld-Goldenfeld relation for moderate irradiation doses. At high doses, the temperature dependence is simply quadratic as expected for a disordered superconductor with line nodes. At no dose level in our proton-irradiated samples and for none of our crystals do we observe the emergence of a full gap as has been reported [26] for a narrow range of T_{c} suppression of electron-irradiated BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} crystals. We attribute this to the difference in electron scattering due to pointlike electron-irradiation-induced defects and extended collision cascades due to proton irradiation.

###### Abstract

Irradiation with 4 MeV protons was used to systematically introduce defects in single crystals of the iron-arsenide superconductor BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2}, x=0.33. The effect of disorder on the low-temperature behavior of the London penetration depth \lambda(T) and transition temperature T_{c} was investigated. In nearly optimally doped samples with T_{c}\sim 29 K, signatures of a superconducting gap with nodes were observed. Contrary to previous reports on electron-irradiated crystals, we do not see a disorder-driven lifting of accidental nodes, and we observe that proton-induced defects are weaker pair breakers than electron-induced defects. We attribute our findings to anisotropic electron scattering caused by proton irradiation defects.

  observed with electron irradiation in Ref. [26] in a similar temperature range. Our study suggests that defects induced by protons are weaker pair breakers than those created by electrons and that anisotropy strongly modifies the effect of impurity scattering on the superconducting gap.

_Experimental details_. Single crystals of high-purity BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} were grown using a self-flux method, and crystals were cut into 300\times 400\mum^{2} rectangles approximately 20\mum thick. Three crystals with nearly optimal doping (x=0.33) were chosen for examination, two with T_{c}\sim 28.7 K and one with T_{c}\sim 29.6 K. Additionally, a larger bar (550\mum\times930\mum \times70\mum) from a different batch with T_{c}\sim 25 K and a room-temperature resistivity of 120\mu\Omega cm was selected for transport measurements. This resistivity value is comparable to reported results [32,33]. All samples were repeatedly irradiated at the tandem Van de Grawl accelerator at Western Michigan University with 4 MeV protons, with characterization performed in between successive irradiation runs. A gold foil was used to disperse the beam to ensure a uniform beam spot over the samples, and the irradiation stage was cooled to \sim-10^{\circ} C during irradiation. TRIM calculations for our irradiation geometry show that proton implantation is negligible [34].

_Results and discussion_. For the three samples, we determined the transition temperature (T_{c}) from the magnetization data, acquired on a custom SQUID magnetometer; the value of T_{c} is taken at the half-height of the transition; see the inset of Fig. 3(a). We find a strong suppression of T_{c} with increasing irradiation dose. The variation of T_{c}, normalized to the respective transition temperature of the pristine sample (T_{c0}), as a function of irradiation dose is shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The transition temperature is suppressed linearly with increasing dose, even at a fairly high dose of 50\times 10^{16}p/cm^{2}. The fact that all of the samples follow this trend indicates that the effect of irradiation-induced defects on electron scattering and pair breaking is the same in all of the samples even though the initial T_{c} values are slightly different. The initial transition width observed on all three crystals is sharp, indicating high-quality single-phase material. The transitions remain sharp with increasing total proton dose, demonstrating that the crystal remains single phase over the entire range of irradiation. Furthermore, the change in T_{c} never saturates with increasing dose, showing that the system remains dominated by interband scattering.

Resistivity measurements were performed in a continuous flow liquid helium cryostat with a standard 4-point contact technique. The temperature dependence of the resistivity is plotted for several irradiation levels in the inset of Fig. 2. Following the initial irradiation dose, subsequent irradiations do not change the curvature of \rho vs T, but only offset the curves, consistent with an increase in \rho_{0}. Figure 2 shows the change in the extrapolated zero-temperature resistivity with irradiation dose. This quantity is directly related to the scattering processes caused by the irradiation-induced defects. We observe nearly linear behavior for small doses, indicating a linear increase in the number of defects for lower doses, followed by a sublinear growth and tendency towards saturation at higher doses [35].

For the transport sample, the reduced T_{c} versus increase in \rho_{0} was directly taken from the transport measurements. The effective increase in \rho_{0} for the SQUID samples had to be inferred by fitting a parabolic function to the \rho_{0} data, Fig. 2. By plotting the SQUID sample dose levels on this curve, the effective increase in \rho_{0} for all dose levels could be estimated, resulting in the data shown in Fig. 1.

The initial decrease in T_{c} with respect to increasing \Delta\rho_{0} is approximately 0.15 K/\mu\Omega cm. This T_{c} suppression

The legend indicates the initial T_{c} of each crystal before irradiation. The line is a guide to the eye. The inset shows the normalized T_{c} from dc SQUID magnetization (filled shapes) and transport measurements (stars) as a function of irradiation dose.

  is weaker as compared to the rate of \sim0.3 K/\mu\Omega cm obtained with electron irradiation [26]. A survey of published data reveals that the T_{c} suppression due to electron irradiation is in general larger than with proton irradiation. In isovalently doped Ba(Fe_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{2}As_{2} electron irradiation induced T_{c} suppression at the rate [36] of \sim0.35 K/\mu\Omega cm whereas for optimally doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} the rate [37] is \sim0.2 K/\mu\Omega cm; the rate of suppression is higher in underdoped samples. In contrast, proton irradiation of optimally doped Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}[35, 38] and Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}[39] yielded T_{c} suppression of 0.16 K/\mu\Omega cm and 0.1 K/\mu\Omega cm, respectively. The rate of suppression is a direct measure of pair-breaking scattering, and low values of the strength of the suppression rate suggest that the defects generated by proton irradiation act as weaker pair breakers than the defects coming from electron irradiation.

The low-temperature variation of the penetration depth \Delta\lambda(T) provides direct information about the low-energy quasiparticle excitation spectrum. For three crystals, the magnetic penetration depth was measured with a custom tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) system operating at \sim14.5 MHz down to 500 mK. In this technique, the frequency shift \Delta f of the resonator is proportional to the change of the penetration depth, \Delta f=G\Delta\lambda, where the geometrical factor G depends on the sample volume and shape, and also the geometry of the resonator coil; G was determined for each sample using a standard procedure [40]. Figure 3(a) summarizes the evolution of the low-temperature TDO response of BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} crystals at various stages of proton irradiation. We illustrate in Fig. 3 the low-temperature power-law behavior of the penetration depth that is an indicator of gap nodes. This agrees with earlier work by Hashimoto _et al._ showing the presence of line nodes from thermal transport and penetration depth measurements [41, 42], and NMR studies by Nakai _et al._[43]. The temperature variations of the frequency shift at various irradiation stages can be fitted to the

Figure 3: Effect of increasing irradiation dose on the change in the resonator frequency (\Delta f) measured on a BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} single crystal with T_{c0}\sim 29 K. Panel (a) displays the evolution of \Delta f with increasing proton dose indicated in units of 10^{16}p/\mathrm{cm}^{2}; the curves are offset by 0.002 along the \gamma axis for clarity. The inset shows T_{c} decreasing with dose and how transitions remain sharp as dose increases in SQUID magnetization data. Panels (b), (c), and (d) show \Delta f data at zero, intermediate, and high dose, respectively, together with various fits. Data in (b) and (c) are well described by the HG function (red lines) whereas the high-dose data follow a T^{2} dependence. At no dose is it possible to fit the data with a BCS-like exponential dependence with a fixed (blue lines) or free (green) gap parameter. The same trends were observed in three crystals, and the data shown are characteristic of the whole set.

  Hirschfeld-Goldenfeld (HG) form [15], originally proposed for a d-wave superconductor with line nodes, \Delta\lambda=AT^{2}/(T+T^{*}), where T^{*} is a measure of disorder in the system and A is a fitting parameter which accounts for all the geometrical factors. For pristine samples, the penetration depth varies essentially linearly with temperature as shown in Fig. 3(b). The samples do show small intrinsic disorder, as evidenced by the finite, small value of T^{*}=0.04 K in the HG function. With increasing doses of irradiation, the value of T^{*} grows; see Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) and Table 1. The penetration depth can still be fitted with the HG function up until a critical dose, above which the penetration depth can only be fitted as T^{2}. We also note that the absence of an upturn in \Delta f at low temperatures shows that p-irradiation-induced defects are nonmagnetic [26, 44, 45].

In contrast to recent reports by Mizukami _et al._, at no dose level in any of our crystals do we observe the emergence of a full gap in our proton-irradiated samples even though we cover the same range of T_{c} suppression and the same measured temperature range as in Ref. [26]. A possible explanation lies in the different structure of electron and proton irradiation induced defects. Irradiation with MeV electrons produces predominantly low-energy recoils resulting in the formation of pairs of point defects (Frenkel pairs), whereas MeV-proton irradiation yields recoils with energies up to keV resulting in a mixture of point defects and small collision cascades [29]. Extensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) work on proton-irradiated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} revealed anisotropic collision cascades of roughly 2-4 nm in size [46, 47]. At present, no such studies exist for BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2}. Although the details of the irradiation-induced defect structure will depend on the material at hand and on the preexisting defects, numerical simulations [48] using TRIM software [34] indicate that proton irradiation of BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} produces a mixture of point defects and nm-sized, possibly anisotropic, cascades. The scattering potential due to point defects is composed of essentially isotropic contributions from Fourier components with wave vectors spanning the entire range, including large wave vectors that span the Brillouin zone. These effectively mix the electron states on the hole and electron Fermi surface sheets causing suppression of T_{c}. In contrast, the cascades, owing to their extended size, are most likely to yield anisotropic scattering at selected wave vectors [49] and small-angle scattering, that is, intraband scattering. Both intraband and interband scattering contribute to the electrical resistance; however, interband scattering is dominant in pair breaking in an s_{\pm} superconductor. Thus, it is expected that the rate of suppression of T_{c} (with respect to increase in residual resistivity) due to proton irradiation is lower as not all defects contribute to interband pair breaking. Furthermore, since the isotropic mixing of states (as assumed in Refs. [19, 20, 25]) does not arise in the case of the extended cascades, it is conceivable that the node lifting is not complete in this case or that a complete gap is significantly smaller than in the corresponding case of electron irradiation such that it cannot be detected in our current temperature range.

In summary, we present measurements of the magnetization, resistivity, and magnetic penetration depth of pristine and proton-irradiated BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} crystals. Upon proton irradiation, T_{c} is continuously suppressed with the transitions staying sharp, and the residual resistivity is increased. The low-temperature variation of the penetration depth of the pristine samples is linear, indicative of line nodes in the superconducting gap. The evolution of the temperature dependence of the penetration depth with irradiation is well described by the Hirschfeld-Goldenfeld relation for moderate irradiation doses. At high doses, the temperature dependence is simply quadratic as expected for a disordered superconductor with line nodes. At no dose level in our proton-irradiated samples and for none of our crystals do we observe the emergence of a full gap as has been reported [26] for a narrow range of T_{c} suppression of electron-irradiated BaFe_{2}(As_{1-x}P_{x})_{2} crystals. We attribute this to the difference in electron scattering due to pointlike electron-irradiation-induced defects and extended collision cascades due to proton irradiation.
