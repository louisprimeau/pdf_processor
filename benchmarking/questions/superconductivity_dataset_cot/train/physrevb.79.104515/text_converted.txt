###### Abstract

We measure magnetotransport of F-doped SmFeAsO samples up to 28 T and we
extract the upper critical fields, using different criteria. In order to
circumvent the problem of criterion-dependent H_(c2) values, we suggest
a thermodynamic estimation of the upper critical field slope dH_(c2)/dT
based on the analysis of conductivity fluctuations in the critical
regime. A high field slope as large as −12 T/K is thus extracted for the
optimally doped sample. We find evidence of a two-dimensional lowest
Landau level (LLL) scaling for applied fields larger than
$\mu_{0}H_{\rm LLL}$∼ 8 T. Finally, we estimate the coherence length
values and we observe that they progressively increase with decreasing
T_(c). In all cases, the coherence length values along the c axis are
smaller than the interplanar distance, confirming the two-dimensional
nature of superconductivity in this compound.

## I Introduction

Since the recent discovery of superconductivity with T_(c) =26 K in
doped LaFeAsO,[1] the class of these iron-based oxypnictides has been
object of intensive research, which have led to the current record of
T_(c)=56 K.[2] In compounds with general chemical formula _RE_FeAsO
(_RE_ = La, Sm, Nd, Ce, ...), it is believed that doped _RE_O layers act
as charge reservoirs for high-mobility FeAs planes, making oxypnictides
very similar to the layered structure of high-T_(c) cuprates. Beyond the
theoretical challenge of understanding the unconventional pairing
mechanism responsible for superconductivity, many studies have been
devoted to superconductive properties of applicative appeal, such as the
huge values of the upper critical field and its dependence on the
particular rare earth _RE_.[3] Slopes of H_(c2)(T) as large as about
−9.3 T/K have been measured in compounds with Sm.[3] Such high H_(c2)(T)
implies a short coherence length that, together with the high T_(c), the
layered structure and the rather anisotropic Fermi surface make these
compounds candidate to present enhanced thermal fluctuations. In the
case of the _RE_=Nd compound, coherence lengths along the c axis, ξ_(c)
varying from 0.26 to 0.9 nm have been evaluated[4, 5, 6] which are lower
or comparable to the distance between the FeAs layers. The occurrence of
remarkable thermal fluctuations, indeed, has been observed by specific
heat[5] and magnetization[7] analyses.

The investigation of thermal fluctuation effects may offer several hints
for the comprehension of these compounds. The identification of
three-dimensional (3D) rather than two-dimensional (2D) thermal
fluctuations is a crucial point because the latter could imply the
occurrence of pronounced dissipation in the mixed state, detrimental for
applications, as observed in cuprates.

Among the oxypnictides, SmFeAs(O_(1 − x)F_(x)) presents high T_(c) [∼54
K (Refs. [3, 8, and 9])], the largest slope of H_(c2)(T) (Ref. [3]) and
high anisotropy,[10, 11] which make this compound the most suitable for
investigating fluctuation effects. In turns, however, due to the
expected fluctuation contribution just above T_(c), there is not
univocal consensus about the criterion for the extraction of the upper
critical field from transport experimental data. Alternatively, a
thermodynamic determination of the transition temperature at different
magnetic fields has been proposed,[5] which is thought to reflect an
intrinsic behavior of the material; in this analysis, lower H_(c2)
slopes and consequently larger coherence lengths have been evaluated.

The same problem has been met with cuprates and the analyses of
fluctuation effects of conductivity, specific heat, magnetization,
Ettinghausen, Hall, and Nernst effects have been suggested to provide a
reliable tool for this aim, provided that fluctuation effects are
significant in an appreciable temperature range around T_(c)(H).
Fluctuation effects are quantified by the Ginzburg number, which can be
expressed for a 3D superconductor by[3] Gi_(3D)=
(πκ²ξ₀K_(B)T_(c)μ₀/2Φ₀²) and, in presence of a magnetic field, by its
magnetic-field-dependent counterpart[12]
Gi_(3D)(_H_)=(2HGi_(3D)²/H_(c2))[23], where κ=λ₀/ξ₀ is the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter, λ₀ is the London penetration depth, ξ₀ is the
coherence length, H_(c2) is the zero temperature limit of the upper
critical field, K_(B) is the Boltzmann constant, H the applied magnetic
field, and Φ₀ is the flux quantum. In conventional superconductors
Gi_(3D)∼ 1 x 10⁻⁵, while in high-T_(c) cuprates it is ∼1 x 10⁻³−1 x
10⁻², making fluctuations significant in an experimentally accessible
temperature window ∼Gi_(3D)⋅T_(c); experimental results indicate that
the actual temperature window of fluctuations is even larger than this
estimate. In the _RE_ = Sm compound, assuming T_(c)≈ 54 K, λ≈ 190
nm,[13, 14] and ξ_(c)≈ 0.6 nm, which is an average value for the _RE_ =
Nd compound, we estimate Gi_(3D)∼ 8 x 10⁻³, so that a similar situation
to the case of high-T_(c) cuprates occurs. For a 2D superconductor, that
could be more appropriate for the case of SmFeAs(O_(1 − x)F_(x)), the
Ginzburg number can be expressed as Gi_(2D)=K_(B)T_(c)/E_(F).[15] From
Hall effect and effective mass data of Ref. [3], this yields
approximately Gi2D = 0.01, a remarkably high value.

In this paper, we measure magnetotransport SmFeAs(O1-Fx) samples with
different doping x, in magnetic fields up to 28 T. From the analysis of
conductivity fluctuations in high fields, in the critical regime close
to and below the transition temperature, we find evidence of 2D behavior
and we extract the high field linear slope of the upper critical field
H_(c2)(T), which is as large as dH_(c2)/dT^(∞) = -12 T/K in the most
doped sample and progressively decreases with decreasing T_(c).
Consequently the coherence lengths values increase, still remaining
smaller than the interplanar distance, which confirms the 2D nature of
superconductivity in these compounds.

## II. Fluctuation conductivity in the critical regime

The classical theory of fluctuations near T_(c) (hereafter, throughout
the treatment of fluctuation effects, the transition temperature T_(c)
must be intended as the mean field transition temperature) predicts that
the fluctuation conductivity Δσ due to finite Cooper pair formation
above T_(c) is described in the 3D and 2D cases by [16,
17]$\Delta\sigma_{\rm 3D}\!\propto\!e^{-1/2}$ and
$\Delta\sigma_{\rm 2D}\!\propto\!e^{-1}$ laws, respectively, where
ε = ln (T/T_(c)) = (T − T_(c))/T_(c). In the Lawrence-Doniach picture
for layered systems, [18], a crossover from 2D to 3D behavior is
expected to occur approaching T_(c), due to the divergence of the
coherence length. Within this Gaussian approximation, the fluctuation
conductivity is therefore predicted to diverge close to the transition
temperature. This nonanalycity is removed if interactions between
fluctuations are taken into consideration, which is necessary in the
so-called critical regime, that is in a region of the T_(c)-H phase
diagram close to T_(c)(H). The temperature range in which critical
fluctuations should be observed is proportional to ξ₀⁻⁶ in the 3D case,
that is an experimentally accessible range of the order of 1 K for
high-T_(c) superconductors. [19] In a magnetic field this range is
expected to increase further as ∼  H^(2/3) or ∼  H^(1/2) in 3D and 2D,
respectively. [20]

In the critical regime, in the limit of strong magnetic fields, a
scaling form for thermodynamic functions is expected. If quasiparticles
are confined in the lowest Landau level (LLL), transport becomes of
one-dimensional (1D) character along the direction of the applied field.
Fluctuation effects close to the superconducting transition are further
enhanced by the lower effective dimensionality of the system. Ullah and
Dorsey [21, 22] calculated the fluctuation conductivity Δσ including the
free energy quartic term within the Hartree approximation and obtained a
scaling law for Δσ in magnetic fields, in terms of unspecified scaling
functions $F_{\rm 2D}$ and $F_{\rm 3D}$, valid for 2D and 3D
superconductors, respectively,

$$\Delta\sigma(H)_{\rm 2D}\!=\!\left(\frac{T}{H}\right)^{1/2}\!F_{\rm 2D}\! \left(A\frac{T\!-\!T_{c}(H)}{\sqrt{TH}}\right),$$
(1a)
$$\Delta\sigma(H)_{\rm 3D}\!=\!\left(\frac{T^{2}}{H}\right)^{1/3}\!F_{\rm 3D}\! \left(B\frac{T\!-\!T_{c}(H)}{(TH)^{2/3}}\right),$$
(1b)

where A and B are characteristic constants of the material. Such
functional dependence still holds even if more tendency to a weaker
metallicity from the optimally doped to the underdoped sample.

The superconducting transitions are quite rounded, making it difficult
to univocally determine the transition temperatures and width. In Table
1 the values of T_(c) obtained by the criterion of 50

In the three right-hand panels of Fig. 1, the zoomed transition regions
in magnetic fields from zero to 28 T for the three samples are shown.
The typical fan-shaped broadenings of the transitions are well visible
for all the samples, indicating an important contribution of
fluctuations.

From these magnetotransport data, we extract the characteristic critical
fields, using different criteria. The criterion proposed in Ref. 7
consists in finding the intersection ρ^(*)(T^(*)) between linear
extrapolations of the ρ(T) curves above and below T_(c). Hence, the
temperatures at which the resistivity is 90

## IV Experimental fluctuation conductivity results

We extract the fluctuation conductivity Δσ as the difference between the
normal state conductivity $\sigma_{\rm n}$ and the measured conductivity
σ. The former, $\sigma_{\rm n}$, is obtained from extrapolation of the
resistivity measured in a temperature interval suitably chosen for each
sample, roughly 30 K around 2T_(c), where fluctuation contribution is
assumed to be negligible. For the three samples, Δσ in zero field as a
function of ε are plotted in the insets of Fig. 3; therein, the solid
lines indicate the 2D asymptotic behavior $\Delta\sigma_{\rm 2D}$∝ε⁻¹.
In the Gaussian regime, not too close to the transition (0.01 <ε< 0.1),
Δσ exhibits a well-defined asymptotic 2D behavior ∝ε⁻¹, delimited at
either sides by sharp crossovers to the critical regime for ε< 0.01 and
the high-temperature short-wavelength regime for ε>0.1.[33] It can be
also seen that the 2D behavior $\Delta\sigma_{\rm 2D}$∝ε⁻¹ is extended
up to ε∼ 0.1, which means 3 to 5 K above T_(c) (it is worth noting that
T_(c) values extracted by this fluctuation analysis fall very close to
the 50

relatively small-T_(c) distribution, but rather accounts for the
in-field broadening of the transition, which is huge in our samples. For
example, in the sample S3, ΔT_(c)(H=0) ∼ 2 K becomes as large as 7 K at
8 T and 17 K at 28 T.

In order to verify the 2D nature of fluctuations, in the main panels of
Fig. 3, we plot Δσ(H/T)^(1/2) versus [T−T_(c)(H)]/(TH)^(1/2), expected
for the 2D LLL scaling, for the three samples. It is apparent that the
2D scaling succeeds in making the curves collapse in an extended
temperature range and for fields above $\mu_{0}H_{\rm LLL}$∼ 8 T. To
compare the 2D with the 3D scaling in Fig. 4, according to Eqs. (1a) and
(1b), we plot the Δσ(H/T)^(1/2) versus [T−T_(c)(H)]/(TH)^(1/2), expected
for the 2D LLL case (left-hand panel) and ΔσH^(1/3)/T^(2/3) versus
[T−T_(c)(H)]/(TH)^(2/3) expected for the 3D LLL case (right-hand panel)
for the one of the samples as representative of all, S2, in linear (main
panels) and semilogarithmic (insets) scales. The maximum and minimum
values of the horizontal axes for the 2D and 3D cases are chosen so that
they correspond to the same temperature interval. The 2D relationship
provides a better scaling of data both below and above T_(c); indeed, in
the 3D case, the curves at different fields open like a fan above T_(c)
and tend to depart from each other also below T_(c). On the contrary, in
the 2D case, the curves above 6 T overlap almost in the whole range,
being the broadening simply due to random scattering of experimental
data. 2D character means that the relevant coherence length ξ_(c) is
smaller than the interplane spacing, or, equivalently, that the
Josephson coupling between adjacent superconducting planes is smaller
than intraplane condensation energy. The success of the scaling also
indicates that the fan-shaped transitions displayed in Fig. 1 are
primarily due to thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order
parameter, rather than to dissipative motion of flux lines. The latter
effect may indeed come into play at low negative values of the variable
in the horizontal axes [T−T_(c)(H)]/(TH)^(1/2), where the fluctuation
conductivity curves start to depart from one another. This occurs
several degrees K below T_(c), just at the tail of the transitions.

The crossover value $\mu_{0}H_{\rm LLL}$∼ 8 T is worth some
considerations. In YBa₂Cu₃O_(x), lower values are generally found [25,
27, 30]. The criterion proposed by Tesanovic [23]$H_{\rm LLL}$∼H_(c2)/3
suggests that the higher upper critical fields of
SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(1 − x) as compared to those of YBa₂Cu₃O_(x) may
account for the difference in the $H_{\rm LLL}$ values.

We can use the validity of the 2D LLL scaling to extract T_(c)(H),
treated as fitting parameter. The so obtained thermodynamic H_(c2)
curves are reported in Table 2 and shown as a function of temperature in
Fig. 2, together with the H_(c2) curves extracted from other criteria.
Remarkable values of the thermodynamic μ₀H_(c2) linear slope at high
fields are found, namely −12 T/K for S3, −7.5 T/K for S2 and −7 T/K for
S1. The value of −12 T/K obtained in the most doped sample is the
largest reported for oxypnicides. With such dH_(c2)/dT value, the single
band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula [34] yields in the zero
temperature
