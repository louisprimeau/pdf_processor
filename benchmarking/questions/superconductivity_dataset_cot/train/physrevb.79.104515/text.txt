###### Abstract

We measure magnetotransport of F-doped SmFeAsO samples up to 28 T and we extract the upper critical fields, using different criteria. In order to circumvent the problem of criterion-dependent \(H_{c2}\) values, we suggest a thermodynamic estimation of the upper critical field slope \(dH_{c2}/dT\) based on the analysis of conductivity fluctuations in the critical regime. A high field slope as large as \(-12\) T/K is thus extracted for the optimally doped sample. We find evidence of a two-dimensional lowest Landau level (LLL) scaling for applied fields larger than \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm LLL}\)\(\sim\) 8 T. Finally, we estimate the coherence length values and we observe that they progressively increase with decreasing \(T_{c}\). In all cases, the coherence length values along the \(c\) axis are smaller than the interplanar distance, confirming the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity in this compound.

## I Introduction

Since the recent discovery of superconductivity with \(T_{c}\) =26 K in doped LaFeAsO,[1] the class of these iron-based oxypnictides has been object of intensive research, which have led to the current record of \(T_{c}\)=56 K.[2] In compounds with general chemical formula _RE_FeAsO (_RE_ = La, Sm, Nd, Ce, ...), it is believed that doped _RE_O layers act as charge reservoirs for high-mobility FeAs planes, making oxypnictides very similar to the layered structure of high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates. Beyond the theoretical challenge of understanding the unconventional pairing mechanism responsible for superconductivity, many studies have been devoted to superconductive properties of applicative appeal, such as the huge values of the upper critical field and its dependence on the particular rare earth _RE_.[3] Slopes of \(H_{c2}(T)\) as large as about \(-9.3\) T/K have been measured in compounds with Sm.[3] Such high \(H_{c2}(T)\) implies a short coherence length that, together with the high \(T_{c}\), the layered structure and the rather anisotropic Fermi surface make these compounds candidate to present enhanced thermal fluctuations. In the case of the _RE_=Nd compound, coherence lengths along the \(c\) axis, \(\xi_{c}\) varying from 0.26 to 0.9 nm have been evaluated[4, 5, 6] which are lower or comparable to the distance between the FeAs layers. The occurrence of remarkable thermal fluctuations, indeed, has been observed by specific heat[5] and magnetization[7] analyses.

The investigation of thermal fluctuation effects may offer several hints for the comprehension of these compounds. The identification of three-dimensional (3D) rather than two-dimensional (2D) thermal fluctuations is a crucial point because the latter could imply the occurrence of pronounced dissipation in the mixed state, detrimental for applications, as observed in cuprates.

Among the oxypnictides, SmFeAs(O\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\)) presents high \(T_{c}\) [\(\sim\)54 K (Refs. [3, 8, and 9])], the largest slope of \(H_{c2}(T)\) (Ref. [3]) and high anisotropy,[10, 11] which make this compound the most suitable for investigating fluctuation effects. In turns, however, due to the expected fluctuation contribution just above \(T_{c}\), there is not univocal consensus about the criterion for the extraction of the upper critical field from transport experimental data. Alternatively, a thermodynamic determination of the transition temperature at different magnetic fields has been proposed,[5] which is thought to reflect an intrinsic behavior of the material; in this analysis, lower \(H_{c2}\) slopes and consequently larger coherence lengths have been evaluated.

The same problem has been met with cuprates and the analyses of fluctuation effects of conductivity, specific heat, magnetization, Ettinghausen, Hall, and Nernst effects have been suggested to provide a reliable tool for this aim, provided that fluctuation effects are significant in an appreciable temperature range around \(T_{c}(H)\). Fluctuation effects are quantified by the Ginzburg number, which can be expressed for a 3D superconductor by[3] Gi\({}_{3\text{D}}\)= (\(\pi\kappa^{2}\xi_{0}K_{B}T_{c}\mu_{0}\)/2\(\Phi_{0}^{2}\)) and, in presence of a magnetic field, by its magnetic-field-dependent counterpart[12] Gi\({}_{3\text{D}}\)(_H_)=(2\(H\text{Gi}_{3\text{D}}^{2}\)/\(H_{c2}\))[23], where \(\kappa\)=\(\lambda_{0}\)/\(\xi_{0}\) is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \(\lambda_{0}\) is the London penetration depth, \(\xi_{0}\) is the coherence length, \(H_{c2}\) is the zero temperature limit of the upper critical field, \(K_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant, \(H\) the applied magnetic field, and \(\Phi_{0}\) is the flux quantum. In conventional superconductors Gi\({}_{3\text{D}}\)\(\sim\) 1 x 10\({}^{-5}\), while in high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates it is \(\sim\)1 x 10\({}^{-3}\)\(-\)1 x 10\({}^{-2}\), making fluctuations significant in an experimentally accessible temperature window \(\sim\)Gi\({}_{3\text{D}}\)\(\cdot\)\(T_{c}\); experimental results indicate that the actual temperature window of fluctuations is even larger than this estimate. In the _RE_ = Sm compound, assuming \(T_{c}\)\(\approx\) 54 K, \(\lambda\)\(\approx\) 190 nm,[13, 14] and \(\xi_{c}\)\(\approx\) 0.6 nm, which is an average value for the _RE_ = Nd compound, we estimate Gi\({}_{3\text{D}}\)\(\sim\) 8 x 10\({}^{-3}\), so that a similar situation to the case of high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates occurs. For a 2D superconductor, that could be more appropriate for the case of SmFeAs(O\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\)), the Ginzburg number can be expressed as Gi\({}_{2\text{D}}\)=\(K_{B}T_{c}\)/\(E_{F}\).[15] From Hall effect and effective mass data of Ref. [3], this yields approximately Gi2D = 0.01, a remarkably high value.

In this paper, we measure magnetotransport SmFeAs(O1-Fx) samples with different doping \(x\), in magnetic fields up to 28 T. From the analysis of conductivity fluctuations in high fields, in the critical regime close to and below the transition temperature, we find evidence of 2D behavior and we extract the high field linear slope of the upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\), which is as large as \(dH_{c2}/dT^{\infty}\) = -12 T/K in the most doped sample and progressively decreases with decreasing \(T_{c}\). Consequently the coherence lengths values increase, still remaining smaller than the interplanar distance, which confirms the 2D nature of superconductivity in these compounds.

## II. Fluctuation conductivity in the critical regime

The classical theory of fluctuations near \(T_{c}\) (hereafter, throughout the treatment of fluctuation effects, the transition temperature \(T_{c}\) must be intended as the mean field transition temperature) predicts that the fluctuation conductivity \(\Delta\sigma\) due to finite Cooper pair formation above \(T_{c}\) is described in the 3D and 2D cases by [16, 17]\(\Delta\sigma_{\rm 3D}\!\propto\!e^{-1/2}\) and \(\Delta\sigma_{\rm 2D}\!\propto\!e^{-1}\) laws, respectively, where \(\varepsilon\!=\!\ln(T/T_{c})\!=\!(T\!-\!T_{c})/T_{c}\). In the Lawrence-Doniach picture for layered systems, [18], a crossover from 2D to 3D behavior is expected to occur approaching \(T_{c}\), due to the divergence of the coherence length. Within this Gaussian approximation, the fluctuation conductivity is therefore predicted to diverge close to the transition temperature. This nonanalycity is removed if interactions between fluctuations are taken into consideration, which is necessary in the so-called critical regime, that is in a region of the \(T_{c}\)-\(H\) phase diagram close to \(T_{c}(H)\). The temperature range in which critical fluctuations should be observed is proportional to \(\xi_{0}^{-6}\) in the 3D case, that is an experimentally accessible range of the order of 1 K for high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors. [19] In a magnetic field this range is expected to increase further as \(\sim\!\!H^{2/3}\) or \(\sim\!\!H^{1/2}\) in 3D and 2D, respectively. [20]

In the critical regime, in the limit of strong magnetic fields, a scaling form for thermodynamic functions is expected. If quasiparticles are confined in the lowest Landau level (LLL), transport becomes of one-dimensional (1D) character along the direction of the applied field. Fluctuation effects close to the superconducting transition are further enhanced by the lower effective dimensionality of the system. Ullah and Dorsey [21, 22] calculated the fluctuation conductivity \(\Delta\sigma\) including the free energy quartic term within the Hartree approximation and obtained a scaling law for \(\Delta\sigma\) in magnetic fields, in terms of unspecified scaling functions \(F_{\rm 2D}\) and \(F_{\rm 3D}\), valid for 2D and 3D superconductors, respectively,

\[\Delta\sigma(H)_{\rm 2D}\!=\!\left(\frac{T}{H}\right)^{1/2}\!F_{\rm 2D}\! \left(A\frac{T\!-\!T_{c}(H)}{\sqrt{TH}}\right),\] (1a) \[\Delta\sigma(H)_{\rm 3D}\!=\!\left(\frac{T^{2}}{H}\right)^{1/3}\!F_{\rm 3D}\! \left(B\frac{T\!-\!T_{c}(H)}{(TH)^{2/3}}\right),\] (1b)

where \(A\) and \(B\) are characteristic constants of the material. Such functional dependence still holds even if more  tendency to a weaker metallicity from the optimally doped to the underdoped sample.

The superconducting transitions are quite rounded, making it difficult to univocally determine the transition temperatures and width. In Table 1 the values of \(T_{c}\) obtained by the criterion of 50% resistivity drop and of \(\Delta T_{c}\) obtained as the temperature interval between 90% and 10% resistivity drops are listed. The \(x\)=0.15 sample presents \(T_{c}\)=51.5 K, the \(x\) =0.1 sample \(T_{c}\)=41.5 K and the least doped sample \(T_{c}\) =33 K.

In the three right-hand panels of Fig. 1, the zoomed transition regions in magnetic fields from zero to 28 T for the three samples are shown. The typical fan-shaped broadenings of the transitions are well visible for all the samples, indicating an important contribution of fluctuations.

From these magnetotransport data, we extract the characteristic critical fields, using different criteria. The criterion proposed in Ref. 7 consists in finding the intersection \(\rho^{*}(T^{*})\) between linear extrapolations of the \(\rho(T)\) curves above and below \(T_{c}\). Hence, the temperatures at which the resistivity is 90% and 10% of \(\rho^{*}\) allow to trace \(H_{90\%}^{*}(T)\) and \(H_{10\%}^{*}(T)\), respectively. Another common criterion consists on extrapolating linearly the normal state resistivity, then trace the parallel straight lines at 90% and 10% of the normal state extrapolation and find the respective intercepts with the \(\rho(T)\) curves; this procedure identifies \(H_{90\%}(T)\) and \(H_{10\%}(T)\), respectively. In Fig. 2, we plot all the above critical fields for the three samples. In Table 2 we report the values of the high field (\(\geq\)8 7) linear slopes of such critical fields. Those extracted from the tails are believed to represent the irreversibility fields, and have similar values for all the samples, around \(-\)2 T/K+\(-\)3 T/K, depending on the used criterion. The critical fields extracted from the onsets of the transitions represent the upper critical fields \(H_{c2}\). As transport always follows the less resistive path, in polycrystalline samples with randomly oriented grains, the measured upper critical fields are the largest ones, that is those of the grains whose \(c\) axis is perpendicular to the applied field (usually labeled \(H_{c2[ab]}\)). These upper critical field slopes vary from \(-\)5 T/K+-20 T/K, depending on the criterion. However, by inspecting Table 2 it is clear that the variations due to different criteria are comparable to the variations from sample to sample. This sensitivity to the used criterion makes it also difficult to compare different values in literature. In Sec. IV, we propose a criterion to extract a thermodynamic \(H_{c2}\) that is based on conductivity fluctuations in the critical regime.

## IV Experimental fluctuation conductivity results

We extract the fluctuation conductivity \(\Delta\sigma\) as the difference between the normal state conductivity \(\sigma_{\rm n}\) and the measured conductivity \(\sigma\). The former, \(\sigma_{\rm n}\), is obtained from extrapolation of the resistivity measured in a temperature interval suitably chosen for each sample, roughly 30 K around 2\(T_{c}\), where fluctuation contribution is assumed to be negligible. For the three samples, \(\Delta\sigma\) in zero field as a function of \(\varepsilon\) are plotted in the insets of Fig. 3; therein, the solid lines indicate the 2D asymptotic behavior \(\Delta\sigma_{\rm 2D}\)\(\propto\)\(\varepsilon\)\({}^{-1}\). In the Gaussian regime, not too close to the transition (0.01 \(<\)\(\varepsilon\)\(<\) 0.1), \(\Delta\sigma\) exhibits a well-defined asymptotic 2D behavior \(\propto\)\(\varepsilon\)\({}^{-1}\), delimited at either sides by sharp crossovers to the critical regime for \(\varepsilon\)\(<\) 0.01 and the high-temperature short-wavelength regime for \(\varepsilon\)\(>\)0.1.[33] It can be also seen that the 2D behavior \(\Delta\sigma_{\rm 2D}\)\(\propto\)\(\varepsilon\)\({}^{-1}\) is extended up to \(\varepsilon\)\(\sim\) 0.1, which means 3 to 5 K above \(T_{c}\) (it is worth noting that \(T_{c}\) values extracted by this fluctuation analysis fall very close to the 50% resistivity drop values reported in Table 1). This interval is larger than the transition width indicating that the presence of some inhomogeneity, which may yield a distribution of \(T_{c}\), does not mask the characteristic behavior of Gaussian fluctuations. However, to avoid possible ambiguities yielded by any \(T_{c}\) distribution, in the following of the paper we focus on the shape of the critical fluctuation conductivity at high fields; in this regime, the LLL scaling is not affected by a

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} Sample & \(x\) & \(T_{c}\)\(\pm\)\(\Delta T_{c}\)/2 \\ (K) \\ \hline S1 & 0.07 & 33.0 \(\pm\) 1.5 \\ S2 & 0.10 & 41.5 \(\pm\) 1 \\ S3 & 0.15 & 51.5 \(\pm\) 1 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

  relatively small-\(T_{c}\) distribution, but rather accounts for the in-field broadening of the transition, which is huge in our samples. For example, in the sample S3, \(\Delta T_{c}(H\)=0) \(\sim\) 2 K becomes as large as 7 K at 8 T and 17 K at 28 T.

In order to verify the 2D nature of fluctuations, in the main panels of Fig. 3, we plot \(\Delta\sigma(H/T)^{1/2}\) versus \([T\)\(-\)\(T_{c}(H)]/(TH)^{1/2}\), expected for the 2D LLL scaling, for the three samples. It is apparent that the 2D scaling succeeds in making the curves collapse in an extended temperature range and for fields above \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm LLL}\)\(\sim\) 8 T. To compare the 2D with the 3D scaling in Fig. 4, according to Eqs. (1a) and (1b), we plot the \(\Delta\sigma(H/T)^{1/2}\) versus \([T\)\(-\)\(T_{c}(H)]/(TH)^{1/2}\), expected for the 2D LLL case (left-hand panel) and \(\Delta\sigma H^{1/3}\)/\(T^{2/3}\) versus \([T\)\(-\)\(T_{c}(H)]/(TH)^{2/3}\) expected for the 3D LLL case (right-hand panel) for the one of the samples as representative of all, S2, in linear (main panels) and semilogarithmic (insets) scales. The maximum and minimum values of the horizontal axes for the 2D and 3D cases are chosen so that they correspond to the same temperature interval. The 2D relationship provides a better scaling of data both below and above \(T_{c}\); indeed, in the 3D case, the curves at different fields open like a fan above \(T_{c}\) and tend to depart from each other also below \(T_{c}\). On the contrary, in the 2D case, the curves above 6 T overlap almost in the whole range, being the broadening simply due to random scattering of experimental data. 2D character means that the relevant coherence length \(\xi_{c}\) is smaller than the interplane spacing, or, equivalently, that the Josephson coupling between adjacent superconducting planes is smaller than intraplane condensation energy. The success of the scaling also indicates that the fan-shaped transitions displayed in Fig. 1 are primarily due to thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, rather than to dissipative motion of flux lines. The latter effect may indeed come into play at low negative values of the variable in the horizontal axes \([T\)\(-\)\(T_{c}(H)]/(TH)^{1/2}\), where the fluctuation conductivity curves start to depart from one another. This occurs several degrees K below \(T_{c}\), just at the tail of the transitions.

The crossover value \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm LLL}\)\(\sim\) 8 T is worth some considerations. In YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{x}\), lower values are generally found [25, 27, 30]. The criterion proposed by Tesanovic [23]\(H_{\rm LLL}\)\(\sim\)\(H_{c2}\)/3 suggests that the higher upper critical fields of SmFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{1-x}\) as compared to those of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{x}\) may account for the difference in the \(H_{\rm LLL}\) values.

We can use the validity of the 2D LLL scaling to extract \(T_{c}(H)\), treated as fitting parameter. The so obtained thermodynamic \(H_{c2}\) curves are reported in Table 2 and shown as a function of temperature in Fig. 2, together with the \(H_{c2}\) curves extracted from other criteria. Remarkable values of the thermodynamic \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}\) linear slope at high fields are found, namely \(-\)12 T/K for S3, \(-\)7.5 T/K for S2 and \(-\)7 T/K for S1. The value of \(-\)12 T/K obtained in the most doped sample is the largest reported for oxypnicides. With such \(dH_{c2}\)/\(dT\) value, the single band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula [34] yields in the zero temperature

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline  & \(\mu_{0}dH_{10\%}^{*}/dT\) & \(\mu_{0}dH_{10\%}/dT\) & \(\mu_{0}dH_{90\%}^{*}/dT\) & \(\mu_{0}dH_{90\%}^{*}/dT\) & \(\mu_{0}dH_{90\%}/dT\) & \(\mu_{0}dH_{\rm int}/dT\) \\ Sample & (T/K) & (T/K) & (T/K) & (T/K) & (T/K) & (T/K) \\ \hline S1 & \(-\)2.8 & \(-\)2.4 & \(-\)5.8 & \(-\)5.3 & \(-\)7.0 \(\pm\) 1 \\ S2 & \(-\)3.7 & \(-\)2.3 & \(-\)7.3 & \(-\)7.1 & \(-\)7.5 \(\pm\) 1 \\ S3 & \(-\)3.6  limit \(\mu_{\text{o}}H_{c2}\)= 0.693 \(T_{c}\mu_{\text{o}}|dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{C}}\)= 400 T. This huge upper critical field is well above the paramagnetic limit and suggests that a Pauli limiting behavior should be evident in these compounds at high fields.[35]

With decreasing \(T_{c}\) the slope values progressively decrease; this is in disagreement with what was observed in LaFeAsOF where \(H_{c2}\) evaluated with the 80% criterion has been found to follow a nonmonotonic trend with \(T_{c}\).[36] In conventional superconductors such as A-15 and MgB\({}_{2}\),[37]\(dH_{c2}/dT\) increases with decreasing \(T_{c}\) because the \(T_{c}\) reduction is often accompanied by an increase of disorder that carries the superconductor into the dirty limit. In short coherence length superconductors like high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates, the dirty limit is not likely achieved and effects related to the doping prevail.[38] This might be the case of oxypnictides, even if disorder effects on \(H_{c2}\) have been suggested for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.9}\)F\({}_{0.1}\).[35] However, lower \(H_{c2}\) values of \(RE\)=La as respect to the \(RE\)=Sm compounds[3] indicate that the latter should present lower intrinsic coherence length, more unlikely affected by disorder. If we neglect disorder effects, the simultaneous reduction of \(dH_{c2}/dT\) and \(T_{c}\) can be explained by a reduction of the coupling that suppresses both the properties.

From \(H_{c2}\) slope values, taking into account that in polycrystals \(H_{c2}\) parallel to the \(ab\) planes is actually probed and assuming an anisotropy factor \(\gamma\)=\(\xi_{\text{ab}}/\xi_{c}\) ranging from 5 to 9 (Refs. [10] and [11]) the coherence lengths can be evaluated by means of the upper critical field obtained from the WHH formula. In Table 3, the values for all the samples are calculated. Despite the large uncertainty on the anisotropy factor \(\gamma\) which includes also a possible dependence of \(\gamma\) on doping, we notice that the average values of \(\xi_{\text{ab}}\) increase remarkably from \(\sim\)23 A to \(\sim\)37 A and those of \(\xi_{c}\) increase from \(\sim\)3.4 A to 5.5 A from sample S3 to S1. This suggests that moving from optimal to underdoped regimes a crossover from 2D to 3D regime could occur, even if in our case \(\xi_{c}\) remains always smaller than the interplanar spacing \(s\)= 8 A, confirming the 2D nature of superconductivity in the measured samples.

An opposite behavior was observed in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{x}\) where thermal fluctuations change from 2D to 3D nature moving from the underdoped to the optimally doped regime.[38, 39, 40] This opposite trend implies an important difference between oxypnictides and high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates. In the latter ones, the doping changes substantially the transport properties from insulating to metallic and increases the coupling between the conducting planes. As a consequence, with increasing doping, the anisotropy progressively decreases and when its value is such that \(\xi_{c}\)=\(\xi_{\text{ab}}/\gamma\) becomes comparable to the interlayer spacing a crossover from 2D to 3D fluctuation regime occurs. Oxypnictides are metallic compounds: fluorine doping determines the occurrence of superconductivity by breaking symmetries of the Fermi surface, but it does not change substantially the transport properties[41] and anisotropy is not expected to change substantially either. Thus, a possible crossover from 2D to 3D fluctuation regime with doping could only be driven by the progressive increase of the coherence length with decreasing \(T_{c}\).

## V V. Conclusions

We study fluctuation conductivity in F doped SmFeAsO polycrystalline samples, in the critical regime close and below \(T_{c}(H)\). At fields above \(\mu_{\text{o}}H_{\text{LLL}}\)\(\sim\) 8 T, the conductivity curves obey the 2D LLL scaling, similarly to the BSCCO superconductor family. Such scaling allows to extract a thermodynamic estimation of the upper critical field, whose high field slope is as large as \(-\)12 T/K in the most doped sample, in fair agreement with the values extracted with the criterion of 90% drop of the resistivity from its normal state value. The corresponding coherence lengths along the \(c\) axis turn out to be from 3 A to 6 A, always smaller than the interplanar spacing \(s\)=8 A, consistently with the 2D nature of superconductivity in these compounds.
