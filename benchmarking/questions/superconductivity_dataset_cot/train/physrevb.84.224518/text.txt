###### Abstract

The CuAl\({}_{2}\)-type Nb\({}_{4}\)_M_Si (_M_ = Ni, Co, and Fe) compound is composed of a quasi-two-dimensional Nb network. We found that Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi with a space group of \(P\)4/_mcc_ is a bulk type-II superconductor (lower critical field value of 10.7 mT and upper critical field value of 1.89 T), with the highest critical temperature (_T_c of 7.7 K) among these compounds. The electron-phonon coupling constant of \(\sim\)0.6 and Debye temperature of 415 K are estimated from the results of heat capacity measurements, and the density functional theory calculation indicates that the electronic density of states around the Fermi level is primarily composed of Nb 4\(d\) orbitals. We report the relationship between _T_c and Debye temperature in the low-dimensional Nb-based system and attribute the relatively high _T_c in Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi to the higher Debye temperature originating from the shortest Nb-Nb distance in the Nb network.

## I Introduction

Compounds with a low-dimensional metal chain are interesting material systems with respect to several physical properties, including charge density wave (CDW) formation,[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] metal-insulator transition (MIT),[6, 7] and emergence of superconductivity.[8, 9, 10, 11, 12] Among these properties, the superconductivity under a weak coupling regime of electron-phonon interactions (\(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}<1\))[13, 14] has attracted attention in the last several years due to correlations between the superconducting _T_c and interchain interactions.[12] However, an understanding of the origin of superconductivity only using this relation in a low-dimensional system is insufficient.

An Nb-based compound with quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) zigzag metal (Nb) chains appears to be suitable for investigating the superconductivity of low-dimensional systems. The superconductivity of these compounds has previously been reported for Nb\({}_{3}\)_Ch\({}_{4}\)_(_Ch_ = S, Se, and Te) with \(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\) of 0.51\(-\)0.59.[8, 15] The Nb-Nb distance between intra- or interchains in this compound changes due to size variations of the _Ch_ \(h\) atoms, and _T_c is influenced by two different factors: Nb-Nb distance and Debye temperature (\(\Theta_{D}\)).[8, 14, 15] These observations indicate that \(\Theta_{D}\) is crucial in order to understand the superconductivity of a low-dimensional Nb-based system.

To date, research on this low-dimensional system has been focused on Nb\({}_{3}\)_Ch\({}_{4}\)_ with a quasi-1D Nb topology, whereas Nb-based compounds with a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) Nb topology have not been studied. Thus, research on a quasi-2D Nb topology is necessary to understand the origin of superconductivity in this low-dimensional system. Nb\({}_{4}\)_M_Si (_M_ = Ni, Co, and Fe), which is composed of a quasi-2D Nb network, is a suitable model material for this purpose. Herein, we report the discovery of superconductivity at 7.7 K in Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi, which has the shortest Nb\(-\)Nb distance among Nb\({}_{4}\)_M_Si compounds, and we discuss the primary factor controlling _T_c in this low-dimensional Nb-based system.

## II Experimental Methods

Polycrystalline samples of Nb\({}_{4}\)_M_Si (_M_ = Ni, Co, and Fe) were prepared by arc-melting a stoichiometric amount of high-purity niobium (99.9%, grain, Kojundo), nickel (cobalt and iron) (99.99%, grain, Kojundo), and silicon (99.995%, chip, Kojundo) under an argon gas atmosphere using a tungsten electrode and a water-cooled copper hearth. A 3 g ingot was arc-melted seven times from different sides to promote sample homogeneity. The ingots were subsequently annealed at 1373-1573 K for 96-144 h in evacuated silica tubes to remove the accumulated stress during arc-melting and then quenched. This postannealing procedure significantly affected the superconducting properties of Nb\({}_{4}\)_M_Si compounds.

Crystalline phases of the resulting samples were identified by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) using a Bruker diffractometer model D8 ADVANCE (Mo rotating anode). Electrical resistivity measurements were performed using the conventional direct current (DC) four-probe method (Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System: PPMS) between 2 and 300 K under a static magnetic field up to 2.4 T, whereas the DC magnetic susceptibility was measured between 2 and 13 K using PPMS with a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) attachment. Specific heat measurements were performed by the thermal relaxation method in the temperature range of 1.8-15 K. To improve thermal contact, the annealed sample (14 mg) was mounted on a thin platform with Apiezon N grease, and the chemical composition of the sample was examined by electron probe microscope analysis (EPMA) with backscattered electron (BSE) mode. The electronic energy band structure and density of states (DOS) were calculated by the plane-wave total energy method using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) ultrasoft pseudopotentials implemented in CASTEP code.[16] To confirm the contribution of each atomic orbital to the electronic states near the Fermi level, the projected density of states (PDOS) was calculated for each atom.

 

## III Results

### Structural characterization

Figure 1(a) shows the PXRD pattern of annealed Nb4NiSi as a representative compound of Nb4_M_Si. Two kinds of space groups of \(P\)4/_mcc_ and _14/mcm_ were previously reported for the crystal structure of CuAl2-type Nb4_M_Si compounds. The difference between these two space groups is due to the ordered or disordered state of \(M\) (_M_ = Ni, Co, and Fe) and Si atoms.[17, 18] The Ni and Si atoms are ordered in the superstructure of \(P\)4/_mcc_ with the position of Ni (0,0,1/4) and Si (1/2,1/2,1/4) and occupancy ratio of Ni/Si \(\sim\)1.00, whereas they are disordered in \(I\)4/_mcm_ with the position of Ni and Si (0,0,1/4) and occupancy ratio of Ni/Si \(\sim\)0.77. When fitting the PXRD pattern only with the space group of \(P\)4/_mcc_, the fitting was poor. For example, several diffraction peaks (16.33\({}^{\circ}\), 16.81\({}^{\circ}\), etc.) were not matched with the space group of \(P\)4/_mcc_. However, we could obtain better fitting by applying the two-phase model of the _14/mcm_ space group. Thus, we concluded that the samples are mixtures of these two phases. The phase constitution obtained by Rietveld analysis is summarized in Table 1. The main phase has the \(P\)4/_mcc_ space group and a volume fraction of 80%, and the phase with \(I\)4/_mcm_ has 10 vol.%. In addition, impurity phases identified are Nb3Ni2Si (\(\sim\)2 vol.%),[19] NbNi3 (\(\sim\)5 vol.%),[20] Nb (\(\sim\)3 vol.%),[21, 22] and other small unknown Ni- or Si-rich phases.

Figure 1(b) shows the crystal structure of the Nb4_M_Si compound described on the basis of Rietveld analysis. The Nb substructure in this compound is stretched to the direction of the (110) plane of the crystal structure, forming a graphite-like network composed of two different Nb\(-\)Nb distances of 2.78 and 2.99 A.

Figures 1(c-1) and 1(c-2) show the BSE image in EPMA for the as-cast and postannealed Nb4NiSi samples. The impurity phases such as the Nb-rich phase are conspicuously decreased, whereas the main phases (_P_4/_mcc_) of Nb4_M_Si are increased through the postannealing process, as summarized in Table 2. After the sample is annealed, however, unknown impurity phases still exist that have a deeper color than that of the Nb4NiSi phase, as shown in element mapping images. The chemical composition of the main phase was 66.0, 17.3, and 16.7 at.% for Nb, Ni, and Si, respectively, and their values were close to the stoichiometry of Nb4NiSi1. Moreover, the ratio of Ni/Si obtained by EPMA was \(\sim\)1.03, which agrees well with the result (Ni/Si = \(\sim\)1.00) obtained by Rietveld analysis. This small deviation in the composition is basically attributed to a short diffusion length of each element under the postannealing process.

### Superconducting properties

Figure 2(a) depicts the electrical resistivity (\(\rho\)) as a function of temperature for Nb4NiSi, the representative compound among Nb4_M_Si. The onset of the superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{c}^{\text{onset}}\)) was \(\sim\)7.7 K, and zero resistivity occurred at 7.3 K. The \(\rho\) value decreased from 1.13 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\)\(\Omega\cdot\)cm at 300 K as the temperature decreased, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). Figure 2(b), which represents the DC magnetic susceptibility measurement, shows a large diamagnetic response below 7.7 K for both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) processes. The shielding volume fraction (SVF) evaluated from this slope was \(\sim\)42% at 2 K. These observations verify that Nb4NiSi is a bulk superconductor with

Vertical bars represent the Bragg peaks for the structure with the space group of \(P\)4/_mcc_ mixed with 14/_mcm_. Peaks for the impurity phases are shown for comparison.

 \(T_{\rm c}\) = 7.7 K, which originates from the phase of \(P4/mcc\). This \(T_{\rm c}\) is relatively higher than that of other Nb\({}_{4}\)\(M\)Si (\(M\) = Co, Fe) compounds (Table 2).

Figure 3(a) exhibits the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization of Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi measured at various temperatures to estimate the \(H_{\rm c1}(T)\). The inset of Fig. 3(a) shows \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(T)\) as a function of \((T/T_{\rm c})^{2}\). The value of \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(T)\) was fitted by the relation of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, [23] and \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)\) was 10.9 \(\pm\) 0.2 mT. Figure 3(b) shows the magnetic field dependence of the electrical resistivity between 2 and 10 K. \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm onset}\) shifted to the lower temperature as the magnetic field increased up to 2.4 T. The inset of Fig. 3(b) plots \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}\) as a function of temperature, and the empirical formula in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory [13] estimated \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)\) as 1.89 \(\pm\) 0.03 T. These results demonstrate that Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi is a type-II superconductor.

Figure 4 shows the heat capacity (\(C_{\rm p}\)) of Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi below 13 K. The specific heat jump, which occurred at a temperature consistent with \(T_{\rm c}\) values determined by resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements, confirmed the bulk nature of superconductivity. The critical temperature from specific heat data was defined as the midpoint of the transition \(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm mid,C}\) = 7.2 K. Below \(T_{\rm c}\), the \(C_{\rm p}\)-\(T\) data followed an exponential decay. The normalized specific heat jump value \(\Delta C/\gamma\)\(T_{\rm c}\)\({}^{\rm mid,C}\) was 0.93 \(\pm\) 0.01, which was substantially smaller than the mean-field BCS value of 1.43. [24] Because the specific heat in the normal state far below \(\Theta_{D}\) is composed of electron and phonon contributions, \(C_{\rm p}\) can be represented by [13]

\[C_{p}(T)/T=(C_{\rm el}+C_{\rm ph})/T=\gamma+\delta T^{2},\] (1)

where \(C_{\rm el}\) and \(C_{\rm ph}\) are the electronic and lattice specific heat, respectively, and \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\) are the coefficients for the electronic and phononic contributions. By the fitting the \(C_{\rm p}T^{-1}\)-\(T^{2}\) plot (the inset of Fig. 4), \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\) in the normal state were determined to be 14.1 \(\pm\) 0.1 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) and 0.1615 \(\pm\) 0.008 mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-4}\), respectively. The \(\gamma\) value would primarily come from Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi, because this value in other ternary metal alloys is not largely changed (\(\sim\)6%) by impurity. [25] It should be noted that most of phononic contribution (\(\beta\)) in Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi would also come from the lattice vibrations along the direction of stretched quasi-2D Nb network, similar to the CuAl\({}_{2}\) compound. [18] Since \(\beta\) can be expressed as [23]

\[\beta=12\pi^{4}n\,R/5\Theta_{D}^{3},\] (2)

where \(n\) is the number of atoms per formula unit for Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi, and \(R\) is the gas constant, \(\Theta_{D}\) was evaluated as 415 \(\pm\) 4 K. \(\Theta_{D}\) can be related to the cutoff phonon frequencies through k\(\Theta_{D}\)

The electron-phonon constant (\(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\)) was obtained by substituting the \(\Theta_{D}\) value in McMillan's formula [Eq. (3)][13]

where the Coulomb pseudopotential \(\mu^{*}\) was assumed to be 0.1.[14] The obtained value of \(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\) was 0.60, and this small value implied that, similar to other Nb-based compounds such as Nb\({}_{3}\)\(Ch_{4}\),[14] Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi is classified as a weak-coupling superconductor.[15] The electronic density of states at the EF was evaluated as N(EF) = 1.8 state eV\({}^{-1}\) f.u.\({}^{-1}\) using the formula \(\gamma=(2/3)\pi^{2}k^{2}{}_{\rm B}(1+\lambda)\)N(EF).

## IV Discussion

It is obvious from the results obtained from the Rietveld analysis of PXRD patterns of the annealed samples and SVF that the bulk superconductivity of \(T_{\rm c}\) = 7.7 K originates from the main phase of Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi with \(P4/mcc\). Among the Nb\({}_{4}M\)Si compounds examined in the present study, Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi showed the highest \(T_{\rm c}\) as summarized in Table 2. So, we discuss Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi in the following section.

The Nb\({}_{4}M\)Si (\(M\) = Ni, Co, and Fe) superconductor has a unique quasi-2D Nb network. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the Nb substructure seems to be a graphite-like 2D network. Polarized Raman spectra of the CuAl\({}_{2}\) compound as the prototype of Nb\({}_{4}M\)Si may be understood by considering the 2D vibrations of the A1 network.[18] From structural similarity, we consider that the isostructural Nb network in Nb\({}_{4}M\)Si may be regarded as a quasi-2D network.

As shown in Fig. 5, the PDOS of Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi shows that the DOS around the Fermi level is mainly composed of Nb \(4d\)

  orbitals. The N(E\({}_{\rm F}\)) value obtained from the calculated DOS was 2.8 state eV\({}^{-1}\) f.u.\({}^{-1}\) This value is comparable with that (1.8 state eV\({}^{-1}\) f.u.\({}^{-1}\)) estimated from experimentally obtained \(\gamma\) in \(C_{\rm p}\) measurements. Similar to other Nb-based compounds such as Nb\({}_{3}\)\(Ch_{4}\) (\(Ch\) = S, Se, and Te) and NbSe\({}_{3}\),[26, 27] this observation indicates that the metallic and superconducting transports mainly originate from Nb 4\(d\) electrons.

Next, we compare the presently studied Nb\({}_{3}\)NiSi superconductor with other Nb-based superconductors composed of a low-dimensional Nb topology. These compounds belong to a weak electron-phonon coupling regime. On the basis of MacMillan formula [Eq. (3)] and \(T_{\rm c}\) = 1.13\(\Theta_{D}\) exp(\(-1/V\)N[E\({}_{\rm F}\)]),[13] where \(V\) is the electron-electron attractive interaction, we expect that \(T_{\rm c}\) mainly depends on \(\Theta_{D}\), \(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\), or N(E\({}_{\rm F}\)). Table 3 summarizes the parameters associated with superconductivity and the structures of Nb-based compounds. Although \(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\) and N(E\({}_{\rm F}\)) are almost independent of \(T_{\rm c}\), \(\Theta_{D}\) is the dominant factor for \(T_{\rm c}\).

Interestingly, Nb\({}_{4}\)\(M\)Si compounds follow the relationship between \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(\Theta_{D}\) as a function of Nb-Nb distance (Fig. 6). \(T_{\rm c}\) gradually increases from Nb\({}_{3}\)Te\({}_{4}\) with a quasi-1D Nb chain to Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi with a quasi-2D Nb network as the Nb-Nb distance decreases from 2.973 to 2.779 A.[28, 29] At the same time, \(\Theta_{D}\) also increases with the decrease of the shortest Nb-Nb distance. In particular, this phononic contribution of \(C_{\rm p}\) in Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi would probably be enhanced by the lattice vibration along the direction of the stretched quasi-2D Nb network similar to CuAl\({}_{2}\) compounds.[18] Otherwise, above a Nb-Nb distance of 3.038 A, Nb\(Ch_{3}\) with a 1D Nb chain does not exhibit superconductivity without the suppression of CDW.[8, 9] From these results, it can be inferred that the evolution of \(T_{\rm c}\) in a low-dimensional Nb-based system originates mostly from \(\Theta_{D}\) of the Nb lattice.

It should be noted that these comparisons in a low-dimensional Nb-based system have been conducted in a weak electron-phonon coupling regime (see \(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\) in Table 3). For a strong coupling regime, the relationship between \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(\Theta_{D}\) conversely changes. For example, \(T_{\rm c}\) of A15-type compounds with a 1D Nb chain increases as \(\Theta_{D}\) decreases.[30, 31] Unlike a weak coupling regime, the softening of the Nb lattice significantly contributes to the enhancement of \(T_{\rm c}\).[31, 32]

Finally, we would like to discuss the difference between Nb-based superconductors in terms of Nb topology. A pure Nb superconductor with a three-dimensional (3D) Nb lattice has a longer Nb-Nb distance (2.857 \(\AA\))[32] than that of Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi with a quasi-2 Nb network, and it exhibits a relatively strong \(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\) (\(\sim\)1) but has a small \(\Theta_{D}\) (\(\sim\)277 K).[13] These values drastically differ from those of Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi (\(\Theta_{D}\sim\)415 K, \(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\)\(\sim\)0.60), indicating that \(T_{\rm c}\) of pure Nb is controlled by strong \(\lambda_{\rm el-ph}\), where the phonon of the Nb lattice is substantially softened by the interatomic charge-charge interactions in the 3D Nb lattice structure.[13, 33, 34]

## V Conclusions

CuAl\({}_{2}\)-type Nb\({}_{4}\)\(M\)Si (\(M\) = Ni, Co, and Fe) compounds with a quasi-2D Nb network exhibit superconductivity with \(T_{\rm c}\) of 6.0-7.7 K. Among these compounds, the highest \(T_{\rm c}\) of 7.7 K was observed in the Nb\({}_{4}\)NiSi compound, and the relatively higher \(T_{\rm c}\) in a low-dimensional Nb-based system is attributed to the higher \(\Theta_{D}\) originating from a quasi-2D Nb lattice, and the \(\Theta_{D}\) increases as the Nb-Nb distance decreases. We expect a higher \(T_{\rm c}\) would be realized in Nb-based compounds with shorter Nb-Nb bonds.
