###### Abstract

The effect of atomic disordering induced by fast neutron irradiation on normal and superconducting state properties of polycrystalline LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} samples was investigated. Fast neutron (E> 0.1  MeV) irradiation to a "moderate" fluence \Phi= 1.6 x 10^{19} cm^{-2} at T_{\rm{int}}= 50 +- 10 ^{\circ}C leads to a complete suppression of superconductivity which recovers almost completely after annealing at T_{\rm{am}}= 570 ^{\circ}C. It is shown that decrease of T_{\rm{c}} under disordering is determined mainly by reduction in electronic relaxation time \tau. Such behavior is qualitatively described by the universal Abrikosov-Gor'kov equation, which testifies to an anomalous type of electron pairing in Fe-based superconductors.

 value of T_{\rm c} still remains much below the initial value of T_{\rm c0}. Subsequent annealing at T_{\rm am}=600-750 ^{\circ} C leads to a further two-times increase in R_{\rm H40} and a practically complete restoration of the initial T_{\rm c} value. It means that R_{\rm H} is not that sole parameter that governs the T_{\rm c} value. In the irradiated state of the sample (with superconductivity suppressed), at T< 30 K, an additional contribution to R_{\rm H}(T) is present, which shows an approximately logarithmic dependence [Fig. 1(b)]. This behavior correlates with the upturn of \rho in this temperature range.

Figure 2 shows the curves of resistivity transitions of the initial, irradiated and annealed states in magnetic fields 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 13.6 T. Transition broadening with the magnetic field in a sample in the initial state is in agreement with similar measurements of samples of the same LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs composition made in Ref. [15]. The irradiated and annealed (at T_{\rm am}=400 ^{\circ} C) sample features a narrower (in absolute value) superconducting transition, which is in agreement with the usual assumption of a spatially uniform (here, on a coherence length scale) distribution of radiation defects. Further annealing leads to gradual displacement of the curves toward the initial state; however, after annealing at T_{\rm am}=750 ^{\circ} C, the value of T_{\rm c} is still \sim2 K below T_{\rm c0}.

In order to define the upper critical-field slope -dH_{\rm c2}/dT from the resistivity curves of transition to a superconducting state, a criterion 0.9 or (rarely) 0.5 of the value of resistivity \rho_{\rm n} in the normal state is usually applied; at that, magnetoresistance noticeably affecting the accuracy of respective values definition should also be taken into account.

Shown in Fig. 3 are dependences H_{\rm c2}(T) defined by these two criteria. It is worth notice that both of the above dependences are quite far from being straight lines in practically all regions of magnetic fields, particularly for the sample in the states with high values of T_{\rm c}. The most natural explanation of such behavior is that the initial (nonirradiated) sample is strongly inhomogeneous in composition, probably in fluorine and oxygen content, and the fact that the shape of the resistive transition curve in polycrystalline layered materials is determined primarily by crystallites with the ab planes oriented nearly perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field.

In a first approximation, the principal changes of -dH_{\rm c2}/dT in samples with different degrees of imperfection are nevertheless not too great. The upper critical-field slope -dH_{\rm c2}/dT, as defined by criterion 0.9 with respect to the value of resistivity \rho_{\rm n} in the normal state, is equal to approximately 3 T/K for the initial sample and increases approximately two times under irradiation.

At low temperatures, a small (\leq2%) negative contribution to magnetoresistance \Delta\rho/\rho is observed, being present even in the superconducting samples at T\congT_{\rm c} (Fig. 4). Such behavior of magnetoresistance clearly points to significant magnetic scattering of the Kondo type, which usually makes a contribution to both resistivity and Hall coefficient (skew Hall effect), which contributes to Hall resistivity \rho_{\rm xy} as a sum[18]\rho_{\rm xy}=c_{\rm H}\rho M+R_{\rm H}H. In expectation of M=const for met

Insets show \rho(T) and R_{\rm H}(T) on a semilogarithmic scale.

  als, we obtain an approximately equal (logarithmic) contribution at low temperatures, which is present both in R_{\rm H}(T) and \rho(T).

In order to understand the strong temperature dependences R_{\rm H}(T) and a quite complex behavior of \rho(T) as a function of temperature and disorder level (see Fig. 1), let us calculate Hall concentration n_{\rm H}=1/(R_{\rm H}e). According to band calculations and different experimental data,[29, 19] the Fermi surface in LaOFeAs consists of several hole and electron bands on a characteristic Fermi energy scale of about 0.1-0.2 eV, therefore R_{\rm H}(T) must have a weak dependence on temperature. But Hall concentration n_{\rm H}=1/(R_{\rm H}e) in the temperature range of T \simeq 40 K is described by an exponential dependence of the kind n_{\rm H}(T)=n_{0}+n_{1} exp(-E_{\rm g}/T) with close values of n_{1} and E_{\rm g} = 800 K, while the main changes in R_{\rm H}(T) are connected with the changes in n_{0} only. This is shown in the inset in Fig. 5(a), where background n_{0} has been subtracted. Such behavior may be interpreted as excitation of charge carriers to a partially populated electron band from another band (or bands) separated by a gap of the order of E_{\rm g}. Then, assuming that n_{\rm H}(T) is a real electron concentration, some useful parameters may be calculated. The mean-free path for a cylindrical Fermi surface[2]

\[l^{*}=(2\,\pi d)^{1/2}h\,\,\{R_{\rm H}\,\}^{1/2}(/{\rm\rho e^{3/2}}),\] (1)

where d is interplane spacing, d= 8.7 A. Besides, it should be borne in mind that we are dealing with a ceramic sample of noticeable porosity (normally 15-20 %), and besides, due to an expected significant (of the order of 10 and over) anisotropy of resistivity, only an average of 1/3 of the sample makes the principal contribution to conductivity. According

Temperature dependences of reduced resistivity \rho/\rho_{40} in magnetic field H= 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 13.6 T of LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs sample: initial (a), irradiated to neutron fluence \Phi= 1.6\times10^{19} cm^{-2} and annealed at 400 (b), 500 (c), and 600 ^{\circ}C (d).

  to the percolation theory,[20] for \sim50% of the well conducting phase, resistivity increases by a factor of k^{*} = 5, thus true path l is related to the value of l^{*} found from Eq. (1) as

\[l\approx l^{*}k^{*}.\] (2)

The temperature dependences of inverse path 1/l found from Eq. (1) vary monotonously at irradiation and annealing. At T \leq 200 K, these dependences are well described by a quadratic dependence characteristic of the prevailing electron-electron scattering [Fig. 5(b)] 1/l^{*} = a_{0} + a_{2}T^{2} with approximately equal values of a_{2}. Disordering decreases l = l^{*}k^{*} from \sim 300 to \sim12 A at low temperatures, and from \sim 15 to \sim 5 A at high temperatures, which looks quite reasonable. In the context of our interpretation, the complex behavior of \rho(T) at annealing, see Fig. 1(a), is due to the diverse effects of two parameters: the decrease in the value of 1/l^{*}(T), see Fig. 5(b), leading to drop of \rho(T), and the decrease in n_{\rm H}(T), see Fig. 5(a), leading to growth of \rho(T).

Besides, knowing coefficient a_{2}, we may calculate effective electron mass m^{*},[21]

\[(m^{*})^{2}=a_{2}\hbar^{4}/(2\pi V_{\rm cell}(k_{\rm B})^{2}),\]

where unit-cell volume V_{\rm cell} \approx 140 A^{3}. Estimates also yield quite "reasonable" values of (m^{*}/m_{\rm e}) = 3 for samples with different degree of disordering. Note that a similar "one-band" interpretation of the Hall coefficient was used in Ref. 22 in describing an experiment in the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} system, x = 0.04-020.

And finally, the behavior of principal experimental parameters as a function of annealing temperature T_{\rm ann} is summarized in Fig. 6. At 300 < T_{\rm ann}< 600 K, principal recovery of the values of T_{\rm c} and 1/l^{*} takes place, and at T_{\rm ann} > 600 K, these parameters vary relatively little. Such nonmonotone behavior usually reflects the complex nature of defects emerging under irradiation and getting successively recombined in the course of annealing. On the other hand, R_{\rm H} displays quite monotone increase with the increase of T_{\rm ann} and does not display clear correlation with the value of T_{\rm c} (particularly in the region of T_{\rm ann}> 600 K), which is probably due to more essential processes of loss of a volatile component (fluorine, oxygen).

For comparison with the theoretical models, we made use of the universal Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) equation describing superconductivity suppression by magnetic impurities (defects) for the case of s pairing and nonmagnetic impurities for the case of d pairing,[23]

\[\ln(T_{\rm c0}/T_{\rm c})=\psi(\alpha+1/2)-\psi(1/2),\] (3)

where \alpha= h/(4\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\tau), \psi is digamma function, T_{\rm c0} and T_{\rm c} are superconducting temperatures of initial and disordered systems, respectively, \tau is electronic relaxation time, which may be constructed from the experimental values,

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature dependence of (a) Hall concentration n_{\rm H} = 1/(R_{\rm H}e) and (b) inverse mean-free path 1/l^{*} defined in text [Eq. (1)]. Insets show n_{\rm H} vs 1/T in semilogarithmic scale (background is subtracted, see text) and 1/l^{*} vs T^{2}. Curve notations are the same as in Fig. 1.

  \[\tau = (m^{*}R_{\rm H})/({\rm e}\rho)\,.\] (4)

Like in Eq. (2), percolation coefficient k^{*} should be also taken into account. Relation (3) describes the decrease of T_{\rm c} as a function of inverse relaxation time \tau^{-1}, superconductivity is suppressed at \alpha>\alpha_{\rm c}=0.88.

Note that the one-band model used here for determining relaxation time \tau, in spite of its obvious contradiction with band calculations and some experimental data (pointing to the presence of holes and electrons in comparable concentrations), gives in some cases [22, 24] a good agreement of low-temperature Hall concentration of electrons n_{\rm H} with the doping level. As noted in Ref. [24], such agreement is most likely connected with the holes mobility being much below the electrons mobility, so it is mainly the electrons that contribute to the Hall effect. In such a case we may expect that the relaxation time, as determined by formula (4) with the use of the low-temperature values of R_{\rm H} and \rho, will be close to its real value.

Experimental dependences are compared in Fig. 7 with an AG model in nondimensional coordinates of T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm c0} as a function of \alpha=h/(4\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c0}\tau). There is a good qualitative agreement, particularly if we remember that \alpha does not contain any fitting parameters. We may hardly expect detailed agreement bearing in mind a number of assumptions made and other uncertainties, especially with regard to the value of percolation coefficient k^{*}. Note that a very similar behavior of superconductivity was observed for HTSC systems, such as YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Refs. [9] and [25]) (see Fig. 7). Thus the experimental data for both Cu- and Fe-based superconductors are in good agreement with the AG theory, which implies the presence of an exotic mechanism of electron pairing in these systems, differing from the isotropic s-wave symmetry.

It is usually considered that radiation defects are equivalent to nonmagnetic impurities in their influence on superconductivity. Nevertheless, as noted in Ref. [4], defects of any kind in iron oxypnictides may, in principle, induce a static magnetic moment in neighbor Fe sites, leading to magnetic scattering. The observed low-temperature logarithmic contributions to R_{\rm H}(T) and \rho(T) and the negative magnetoresistance \Delta\rho/\rho clearly point to such scattering. The authors of Ref. [26] studied theoretically, in the s^{\pm} pairing symmetry approximation, the influence of magnetic impurities on superconductivity which is suppressed due to intraband scattering. In such approximation, they were able to quantitatively describe the effect of neutron irradiation on T_{\rm c} in LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs. [10] Since, within the scope of the s^{\pm} model, nonmagnetic impurities in the case of interband scattering are identical to magnetic impurities in the case of intraband scattering, [8, 27] and in the absence of any magnetic data on the irradiated LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs samples, it would be too early to jump to a conclusion with regard to which kind of disordering (magnetic or nonmagnetic) leads to suppression of superconductivity in this case.

Shown with dotted lines are value levels for nonirradiated state.

(3)]. Line 3 shows T_{\rm c} suppression of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [25]).

  In conclusion, we investigated the effect of irradiation with fast neutrons and subsequent isochronal annealing on the properties of normal [resistivity \rho(T), Hall coefficient R_{\rm H}(T)] and superconducting (transition temperature T_{\rm c}, upper critical field H_{\rm c2}) states of the LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs polycrystalline sample. The observed suppression of superconductivity is accompanied by effective system doping (electrons concentration growth). Assuming that radiation defects lead predominantly to nonmagnetic interband scattering (defects are equivalent to nonmagnetic impurities), fast suppression of superconductivity under irradiation most probably points to an anomalous type of Cooper pairing in this system.

The effect of atomic disordering induced by fast neutron irradiation on normal and superconducting state properties of polycrystalline LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} samples was investigated. Fast neutron (E> 0.1  MeV) irradiation to a "moderate" fluence \Phi= 1.6 x 10^{19} cm^{-2} at T_{\rm{int}}= 50 +- 10 ^{\circ}C leads to a complete suppression of superconductivity which recovers almost completely after annealing at T_{\rm{am}}= 570 ^{\circ}C. It is shown that decrease of T_{\rm{c}} under disordering is determined mainly by reduction in electronic relaxation time \tau. Such behavior is qualitatively described by the universal Abrikosov-Gor'kov equation, which testifies to an anomalous type of electron pairing in Fe-based superconductors.

 value of T_{\rm c} still remains much below the initial value of T_{\rm c0}. Subsequent annealing at T_{\rm am}=600-750 ^{\circ} C leads to a further two-times increase in R_{\rm H40} and a practically complete restoration of the initial T_{\rm c} value. It means that R_{\rm H} is not that sole parameter that governs the T_{\rm c} value. In the irradiated state of the sample (with superconductivity suppressed), at T< 30 K, an additional contribution to R_{\rm H}(T) is present, which shows an approximately logarithmic dependence [Fig. 1(b)]. This behavior correlates with the upturn of \rho in this temperature range.

Figure 2 shows the curves of resistivity transitions of the initial, irradiated and annealed states in magnetic fields 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 13.6 T. Transition broadening with the magnetic field in a sample in the initial state is in agreement with similar measurements of samples of the same LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs composition made in Ref. [15]. The irradiated and annealed (at T_{\rm am}=400 ^{\circ} C) sample features a narrower (in absolute value) superconducting transition, which is in agreement with the usual assumption of a spatially uniform (here, on a coherence length scale) distribution of radiation defects. Further annealing leads to gradual displacement of the curves toward the initial state; however, after annealing at T_{\rm am}=750 ^{\circ} C, the value of T_{\rm c} is still \sim2 K below T_{\rm c0}.

In order to define the upper critical-field slope -dH_{\rm c2}/dT from the resistivity curves of transition to a superconducting state, a criterion 0.9 or (rarely) 0.5 of the value of resistivity \rho_{\rm n} in the normal state is usually applied; at that, magnetoresistance noticeably affecting the accuracy of respective values definition should also be taken into account.

Shown in Fig. 3 are dependences H_{\rm c2}(T) defined by these two criteria. It is worth notice that both of the above dependences are quite far from being straight lines in practically all regions of magnetic fields, particularly for the sample in the states with high values of T_{\rm c}. The most natural explanation of such behavior is that the initial (nonirradiated) sample is strongly inhomogeneous in composition, probably in fluorine and oxygen content, and the fact that the shape of the resistive transition curve in polycrystalline layered materials is determined primarily by crystallites with the ab planes oriented nearly perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field.

The upper critical-field slope -dH_{\rm c2}/dT, as defined by criterion 0.9 with respect to the value of resistivity \rho_{\rm n} in the normal state, is equal to approximately 3 T/K for the initial sample and increases approximately two times under irradiation.

At low temperatures, a small (\leq2%) negative contribution to magnetoresistance \Delta\rho/\rho is observed, being present even in the superconducting samples at T\congT_{\rm c} (Fig. 4). Such behavior of magnetoresistance clearly points to significant magnetic scattering of the Kondo type, which usually makes a contribution to both resistivity and Hall coefficient (skew Hall effect), which contributes to Hall resistivity \rho_{\rm xy} as a sum[18]\rho_{\rm xy}=c_{\rm H}\rho M+R_{\rm H}H.

\[l^{*}=(2\,\pi d)^{1/2}h\,\,\{R_{\rm H}\,\}^{1/2}(/{\rm\rho e^{3/2}}),\] (1)

where d is interplane spacing, d= 8.7 A. Besides, it should be borne in mind that we are dealing with a ceramic sample of noticeable porosity (normally 15-20 %), and besides, due to an expected significant (of the order of 10 and over) anisotropy of resistivity, only an average of 1/3 of the sample makes the principal contribution to conductivity. According

Temperature dependences of reduced resistivity \rho/\rho_{40} in magnetic field H= 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 13.6 T of LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs sample: initial (a), irradiated to neutron fluence \Phi= 1.6\times10^{19} cm^{-2} and annealed at 400 (b), 500 (c), and 600 ^{\circ}C (d).

  to the percolation theory,[20] for \sim50% of the well conducting phase, resistivity increases by a factor of k^{*} = 5, thus true path l is related to the value of l^{*} found from Eq. (1) as

\[l\approx l^{*}k^{*}.\] (2)

The temperature dependences of inverse path 1/l found from Eq. (1) vary monotonously at irradiation and annealing. At T \leq 200 K, these dependences are well described by a quadratic dependence characteristic of the prevailing electron-electron scattering [Fig. 5(b)] 1/l^{*} = a_{0} + a_{2}T^{2} with approximately equal values of a_{2}. Disordering decreases l = l^{*}k^{*} from \sim 300 to \sim12 A at low temperatures, and from \sim 15 to \sim 5 A at high temperatures, which looks quite reasonable. In the context of our interpretation, the complex behavior of \rho(T) at annealing, see Fig. 1(a), is due to the diverse effects of two parameters: the decrease in the value of 1/l^{*}(T), see Fig. 5(b), leading to drop of \rho(T), and the decrease in n_{\rm H}(T), see Fig. 5(a), leading to growth of \rho(T).

Besides, knowing coefficient a_{2}, we may calculate effective electron mass m^{*},[21]

\[(m^{*})^{2}=a_{2}\hbar^{4}/(2\pi V_{\rm cell}(k_{\rm B})^{2}),\]

where unit-cell volume V_{\rm cell} \approx 140 A^{3}. Estimates also yield quite "reasonable" values of (m^{*}/m_{\rm e}) = 3 for samples with different degree of disordering. Note that a similar "one-band" interpretation of the Hall coefficient was used in Ref. 22 in describing an experiment in the Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} system, x = 0.04-020.

And finally, the behavior of principal experimental parameters as a function of annealing temperature T_{\rm ann} is summarized in Fig. 6. At 300 < T_{\rm ann}< 600 K, principal recovery of the values of T_{\rm c} and 1/l^{*} takes place, and at T_{\rm ann} > 600 K, these parameters vary relatively little. Such nonmonotone behavior usually reflects the complex nature of defects emerging under irradiation and getting successively recombined in the course of annealing. On the other hand, R_{\rm H} displays quite monotone increase with the increase of T_{\rm ann} and does not display clear correlation with the value of T_{\rm c} (particularly in the region of T_{\rm ann}> 600 K), which is probably due to more essential processes of loss of a volatile component (fluorine, oxygen).

For comparison with the theoretical models, we made use of the universal Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) equation describing superconductivity suppression by magnetic impurities (defects) for the case of s pairing and nonmagnetic impurities for the case of d pairing,[23]

\[\ln(T_{\rm c0}/T_{\rm c})=\psi(\alpha+1/2)-\psi(1/2),\] (3)

where \alpha= h/(4\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}\tau), \psi is digamma function, T_{\rm c0} and T_{\rm c} are superconducting temperatures of initial and disordered systems, respectively, \tau is electronic relaxation time, which may be constructed from the experimental values,

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature dependence of (a) Hall concentration n_{\rm H} = 1/(R_{\rm H}e) and (b) inverse mean-free path 1/l^{*} defined in text [Eq. (1)]. Insets show n_{\rm H} vs 1/T in semilogarithmic scale (background is subtracted, see text) and 1/l^{*} vs T^{2}. Curve notations are the same as in Fig. 1.

  \[\tau = (m^{*}R_{\rm H})/({\rm e}\rho)\,.\] (4)

Like in Eq. (2), percolation coefficient k^{*} should be also taken into account. Relation (3) describes the decrease of T_{\rm c} as a function of inverse relaxation time \tau^{-1}, superconductivity is suppressed at \alpha>\alpha_{\rm c}=0.88.

Note that the one-band model used here for determining relaxation time \tau, in spite of its obvious contradiction with band calculations and some experimental data (pointing to the presence of holes and electrons in comparable concentrations), gives in some cases [22, 24] a good agreement of low-temperature Hall concentration of electrons n_{\rm H} with the doping level. As noted in Ref. [24], such agreement is most likely connected with the holes mobility being much below the electrons mobility, so it is mainly the electrons that contribute to the Hall effect. In such a case we may expect that the relaxation time, as determined by formula (4) with the use of the low-temperature values of R_{\rm H} and \rho, will be close to its real value.

Experimental dependences are compared in Fig. 7 with an AG model in nondimensional coordinates of T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm c0} as a function of \alpha=h/(4\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c0}\tau). There is a good qualitative agreement, particularly if we remember that \alpha does not contain any fitting parameters. We may hardly expect detailed agreement bearing in mind a number of assumptions made and other uncertainties, especially with regard to the value of percolation coefficient k^{*}. Note that a very similar behavior of superconductivity was observed for HTSC systems, such as YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Refs. [9] and [25]) (see Fig. 7). Thus the experimental data for both Cu- and Fe-based superconductors are in good agreement with the AG theory, which implies the presence of an exotic mechanism of electron pairing in these systems, differing from the isotropic s-wave symmetry.

It is usually considered that radiation defects are equivalent to nonmagnetic impurities in their influence on superconductivity. Nevertheless, as noted in Ref. [4], defects of any kind in iron oxypnictides may, in principle, induce a static magnetic moment in neighbor Fe sites, leading to magnetic scattering. The observed low-temperature logarithmic contributions to R_{\rm H}(T) and \rho(T) and the negative magnetoresistance \Delta\rho/\rho clearly point to such scattering. The authors of Ref. [26] studied theoretically, in the s^{\pm} pairing symmetry approximation, the influence of magnetic impurities on superconductivity which is suppressed due to intraband scattering. In such approximation, they were able to quantitatively describe the effect of neutron irradiation on T_{\rm c} in LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs. [10] Since, within the scope of the s^{\pm} model, nonmagnetic impurities in the case of interband scattering are identical to magnetic impurities in the case of intraband scattering, [8, 27] and in the absence of any magnetic data on the irradiated LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs samples, it would be too early to jump to a conclusion with regard to which kind of disordering (magnetic or nonmagnetic) leads to suppression of superconductivity in this case.

Shown with dotted lines are value levels for nonirradiated state.

(3)]. Line 3 shows T_{\rm c} suppression of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [25]).

  In conclusion, we investigated the effect of irradiation with fast neutrons and subsequent isochronal annealing on the properties of normal [resistivity \rho(T), Hall coefficient R_{\rm H}(T)] and superconducting (transition temperature T_{\rm c}, upper critical field H_{\rm c2}) states of the LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1}FeAs polycrystalline sample. The observed suppression of superconductivity is accompanied by effective system doping (electrons concentration growth). Assuming that radiation defects lead predominantly to nonmagnetic interband scattering (defects are equivalent to nonmagnetic impurities), fast suppression of superconductivity under irradiation most probably points to an anomalous type of Cooper pairing in this system.
