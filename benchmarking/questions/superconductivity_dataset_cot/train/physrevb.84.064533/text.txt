###### Abstract

We study the correlation between crystalline structure and superconducting properties in Na-doped Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Na\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals for three chemical compositions (_x_ = 0.5, 0.6, 0.75). We find the maximum superconducting transition temperature _T\({}_{c}\)_\(\sim\) 33.4 K at \(x\) \(\sim\) 0.75. The Na substitution causes the decrease of the _a-b_ crystallographic axes and the increase of the \(c\) axis in the tetragonal phase. The single crystals show perfect diamagnetism, indicating full superconducting volume. The anisotropy ratio for the upper critical field near the superconducting transition temperature is \(g\) = 1.85 \(\pm\) 0.05, independently of the Na content. A narrow vortex liquid phase was detected in the sample with highest _T\({}_{c}\)_ (_x_ = 0.75), consistent with the expectations based on a Lindemann criterion. The analysis of the critical currents shows no evidence of correlated pinning and indicates that the pinning arises from a combination of several mechanisms. At low fields, pinning by random nanoparticles dominates. At higher fields, a small and field independent _J\({}_{c}\)_ in the optimally doped crystal may originate in the simultaneous presence of sparse large nanoparticles and a much denser distribution of smaller particles, with the sparse pins producing a caging effect that constrains the volume of the vortex bundle associated with the denser and weaker defects.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity in iron pnictide superconductors with _T\({}_{c}\)_\(\sim\) 26 K in LaFeAsO(F), much effort has been focused on finding new compounds.[1, 2] These materials exhibit a variety of physical properties and ground states, e.g., spin density waves and superconductivity.[2] In the AFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) family (122, A: Ca, Sr, Ba), the properties are strongly influenced by doping. The ternary iron arsenide CaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) is an antiferromagnet that exhibits no superconductivity, but superconductivity can be induced by partial chemical substitution of Ca by Na.[3, 4, 5] substitution of As by P,[6] or with applied pressure.[7, 8] Recently, a _T\({}_{c}\)_\(\sim\) 33 K was reported in Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Na\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) with \(x\) \(\sim\) 0.66.[9] This is the highest _T\({}_{c}\)_ observed for this compound and, interestingly, it is reached for a higher hole doping than in other 122 systems such as (Ba,K)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and (Sr,K)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), where the best _T\({}_{c}\)_ (38 and 35 K, respectively) occurs for \(x\) \(\sim\) 0.4.[10, 11] Clearly, the superconducting properties of the hole-doped 122 pnictides are not determined only by doping level because the interband coupling between the hole and electron bands also plays an important role. The observed differences in the superconducting properties of different 122 pnictides are attributed to different relative filling factors of the electron and hole Fermi pockets[12, 13] that constitute their Fermi surfaces.

The layered structure in pnictides induces anisotropy in the electronic properties, but in contrast to the case of single-band materials, the angular dependence of the superconducting parameters can not be described by a single temperature-independent anisotropy parameter \(g\). Indeed, if we use the usual definition \(g\) = \(H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c}\), where \(H_{c2}^{ab}\) and _t_\({}^{c}\) are the upper critical fields along the _ab_ plane and \(c\) axis, respectively, then \(g\) is temperature (_T_) dependent. In addition, _H\({}_{c2}\)_(_T_,6), where \(\Theta\) is the angle between the applied magnetic field **H** and the crystallographic \(c\) axis, does not follow the standard dependence _H\({}_{c2}\)_(_T_,6) = \(H_{c2}\)(_T_,\(\Theta\) = 0)/_e_(\(\Theta\)), where _e_(\(\Theta\)) = (cos2\({}^{\circ}\) + _g_-sin2\({}^{\circ}\))\({}^{1/2}\), and can even exhibit two maxima at **H\(\parallel\)**_c_ and **H\(\parallel\)**_ab.[14]_ These unconventional features are commonly attributed to the multiband nature of superconductivity in these compounds.[15, 16, 17] Most studies in 122 iron arsenides show that \(g\) \(\sim\) 2 close to _T\({}_{c}\)_ and decreases to values near 1 at low temperatures.[16] This _g_(_T_) dependence looks similar in all the 122 materials, independently of the carrier nature.[18, 19, 16] One exception was reported for pressure-induced superconductivity in CaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals, where \(g\) is close to 1 near _T\({}_{c}\)_ (12 K) and increases to \(g\) \(\sim\) 1.2 at ~_T\({}_{c}\)_/2.[7] Considering these results and the difference in the chemical doping dependence of _T\({}_{c}\)_ in Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Na\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), more studies are necessary to clarify the influence of the doping on _T\({}_{c}\)_ and anisotropic properties.

In a related topic, several studies in 122 pnictides discuss the existence of a liquid phase in the vortex phase diagram.[20, 21, 22] In cuprate superconductors, the presence of an extended vortex liquid phase is associated with the high _T\({}_{c}\)_ and concomitant small coherence length (_x_), and the high \(g\) (~5-7 in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7.4}\) and >100 in Bi-based compounds). In the pnictide superconductors, the large number of compounds with tunable doping levels gives rise to a broad range of _T\({}_{c}\)_ and anisotropies. This opens up the possibility of a rich variety of vortex phase diagrams, but on the other hand, the smaller _T\({}_{c}\)_ and \(g\) as compared to high-_T\({}_{c}\)_ superconductivity (HTS) oxides may result in a narrower or even absent vortex liquid phase. A vortex melting transition has been observed in Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (Refs. [21, 22]) and in Co-doped BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) films.[23] However, the mechanisms that govern the solid-liquid  transition in pnictide superconductors are still not fully understood. For example, the temperature-dependent anisotropy, the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism,[24] and the presence of anomalous magnetization effects[25] may all have a significant role in the vortex dynamics of these materials.

In this paper, we study the effects of Na chemical doping on the crystalline structure and superconducting properties of Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Na\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals. We analyze the effect of the charge carrier density on the \(H_{c2}\) anisotropy in single crystals (SC) with very different \(T_{c}\)'s, where a chemical doping of \(x\sim\) 0.5 and 0.75 induces \(T_{c}\)'s of 19 and 33 K, respectively. Our results show that the anisotropy of all the samples can be modeled with a single-band anisotropy with \(\gamma\sim\) 1.85 for \(T\sim T_{c}\) independently of the doping level. In the SC with \(T_{c}\sim\) 33 K, we detect the presence of a narrow vortex liquid phase in agreement with the Lindemann criterion for the superconducting parameters \(T_{c}\), \(H_{c2}\), and the Ginzburg number (\(G_{i}\)).[26]

## II Experimental procedures

The single crystals were grown by the self-flux technique. The starting composition ratio was selected as Na\({}_{1.0}\)Ca\({}_{0.3}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). The mixtures of NaAs, CaAs, FeAs, and Fe\({}_{2}\)As were put into an alumina crucible and sealed in a Ta crucible under 1.6 atmosphere of argon gas. The Ta crucible was then sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule and heated to 1160 \({}^{\circ}\)C and cooled slowly at 5 \({}^{\circ}\)C/h to grow single crystals. Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Na\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals with three different chemical compositions were selected for this study: \(x\) = 0.50 \(\pm\) 0.05 (\(x\) = 0.5), \(x\) = 0.60 \(\pm\) 0.05 (\(x\) = 0.6), and \(x\) = 0.75 \(\pm\) 0.05 (\(x\) = 0.75). The phase purity for each crystal was checked by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a four-circle diffractometer goniometer. The composition was determined by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis and Rutherford backscattering.

The \(T\) and \(\mathbf{H}\) dependence of the magnetization was studied using a superconductor quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Electrical resistivity was measured using the four-probe technique. The samples were mounted in a rotatable probe and the measurements were performed in applied magnetic fields between 0 and 15 T. Resistivity data were taken with an ac resistance bridge using a current density of \(\sim\)30 A cm\({}^{-2}\). Transport measurements were conducted with applied current (\(\mathbf{J}\)) perpendicular to \(\mathbf{H}\) in a maximum Lorentz force configuration.

All the single crystals exhibit a plateletlike morphology with the \(c\) axis perpendicular to the plane of the plate. At least two samples of each composition were initially characterized by magnetization and consistent results were obtained. In all cases, a 100% superconducting volume fraction was observed (see lower critical fields section). For the detailed studies on the crystals with \(x\) = 0.5 and 0.75, we used the same pieces for magnetization and transport, which in both cases can be approximated by parallelepipeds with dimensions (\(l\), \(w\), \(t\)) of 1.0 \(\times\) 0.145 \(\times\) 0.028 mm\({}^{3}\) and 0.8 \(\times\) 0.655 \(\times\) 0.042 mm\({}^{3}\), respectively.

## III Results

### Crystalline structure

The chemical composition for each SC was determined by averaging of 20 measurements at different locations on the sample. The peaks were indexed on the basis of a tetragonal ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\)-type structure as was previously reported.[3, 10] Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the lattice parameters derived from the (00l), (012), (013), and (112) reflections. These results are in agreement with previously reported data, which are also included for comparison.[3, 4, 5, 6] We observe that an increase in the sodium doping leads to an increase of the \(c\) axis and a compression in the \(a\)-axis parameter, resulting in an increase of the \(c/a\) ratio as shown in Fig. 1(c).

### Superconducting transition temperature

The \(T_{c}\) of the three crystals was determined by magnetization measurements at low magnetic fields (\(\sim\)1.5 Oe) parallel to the \(c\) axis after performing a zero-field cooling; the composition dependence is shown in Fig. 1(d). Electrical transport measurements were performed on \(x=0.5\) and 0.75, which show the minimum and maximum \(T_{c}\), respectively. Figure 2 shows normalized resistance [\(R/R(T_{c}\),\(H\!=\!0)\)] versus \(T\) at several \(H\) applied along the c axis. The data are normalized to the normal state resistivity (\(\rho_{N}\)), defined as \(\rho\) at the onset of the superconducting transition for \(\mathbf{H}\!=\!0\). The \(T_{c}\) values for \(x\!=\!0.5\) and 0.75, obtained from the \(H\!=\!0\) curves and defined as the intersection of linear fits to \(\rho(T)\) in the normal state and transition regions (see sketch in Fig. 2) are \(\sim\)19.4 and \(\sim\)33.4 K, respectively, consistent with Fig. 1(d). These \(T_{c}\) values are in agreement with those previously reported, also included in Fig. 1(d), and clearly demonstrate that the highest \(T_{c}\) in this compound occurs at a doping different than in other 122 materials.[10; 11] The transition in \(x\!=\!0.75\) shows a small but clear structure that may be associated with chemical inhomogeneity, however, it is rather sharp, with a total \(\Delta T_{c}\sim\) 0.5 K. Furthermore, if we consider the portions of \(\rho(T)\) above and below the structure as the transitions of two samples, each individual transition is extremely sharp, with \(\Delta T_{c}\!\sim\!0.1\) K. Considering that thermal fluctuations impose a minimum transition width \(\Delta T_{c}\geqslant G_{i}^{*}T_{c}\), this sets an upper limit \(G_{i}\leqslant\) 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-3}\) for \(x\!=\!0.75\). The transition in \(x\!=\!0.5\) is significantly wider, i.e., \(\Delta T_{c}\!\sim\!2\) K.

### Upper critical fields

We now turn to the \(R(T)\) in applied magnetic fields in Fig. 2. We note that both samples show appreciable magnetoresistance in the normal state, the effect being stronger in \(x\!=\!0.5\) than in \(x\!=\!0.75\). While this feature warrants further investigation, it is beyond the scope of this paper. The upper critical fields (\(H_{c2}\)) are determined using the same criterion previously described for \(T_{c}\). Also indicated in Fig. 2 is the criterion for the determination of the irreversibility field (\(H_{\rm irr}\)), to be discussed below.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show \(H_{c2}\) versus \(T\) with \(\mathbf{H}\|c\) and \(\mathbf{H}\|ab\) for \(x\!=\!0.5\) and 0.75, respectively. To a good approximation, \(H_{c2}(T)\) is linear in all cases, with average slopes

\[-\left.\frac{\partial H_{c2}^{ab}}{\partial T}\right|_{T_{c}}=4\,{\rm T/K},\; \;\;-\left.\frac{\partial H_{c2}^{c}}{\partial T}\right|_{T_{c}}=2.2\,{\rm T/ K}\;\;\;\;{\rm for}\;\;x=0.5\]

and

\[-\left.\frac{\partial H_{c2}^{ab}}{\partial T}\right|_{T_{c}}=7.15\,{\rm T/K}, \;\;\;-\left.\frac{\partial H_{c2}^{c}}{\partial T}\right|_{T_{c}}=4\,{\rm T/ K}\;\;\;\;{\rm for}\;\;x=0.75.\]

Using the standard definition of anisotropy, for each sample, the ratio of the \(H_{c2}(T)\) linear slopes for \(\mathbf{H}\|c\) and \(\mathbf{H}\|ab\) gives \(\gamma\), which in both cases is temperature independent in the measured range within our experimental error. Remarkably, we obtain the same value for both crystals, \(\gamma\!=\!1.85\pm 0.05\).

Considering that multiband effects are known to produce anomalous \(H_{c2}(\Theta)\) dependences, measurements for \(\mathbf{H}\|c\) and \(\mathbf{H}\|ab\) are not enough to fully determine the angle-dependent behavior in these superconductors.[14; 16] To further explore this issue, we measured \(\rho(T)\) at constant \(H\) at different orientations to extract \(H_{c2}(T,\Theta)\) values [and also \(H_{\rm irr}(T,\Theta)\), to be discussed below]. As examples, the \(T_{c2}(\Theta)\) data obtained from \(\rho(T)\) at \(\mu_{0}H\!=\!12\) T for both crystals are shown in Fig. 4. The dotted lines represent the anisotropic scaling using the \(H_{c2}(T,\Theta\!=\!0)\) data from Fig. 3 and \(\gamma\!=\!1.85\). In a single-band anisotropic superconductor, if the appropriate \(\gamma\)

 is used, all the \(H_{c2}\)(\(T\),\(\Theta\)) data should collapse on a single curve \(\hat{H}_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(T,\Theta)e(\Theta)\). Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show \(\hat{H}_{c2}(T)\) for \(x=0.5\) and \(0.75\), respectively. Both curves in Fig. 5 include data measured at \(\mu_{0}\)H = 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 T, and several orientations (including 0 and 90\({}^{\circ}\)) as indicated by the various symbols. In both samples, the curves collapse on a single curve using a \(y\sim\) 1.85 \(\pm\) 0.05, indicating that all our \(H_{c2}\)(\(T\),\(\Theta\)) data in both crystals are well described by a single-band anisotropic model. It is important to mention, however, that \(H_{c2}\) for multiband superconductors behaves as in a single-band material close to \(T_{c}\).[14] Our field range allows us to access the full angular range for reduced temperatures \(t=T/T_{c}>0.81\) for \(x=0.5\) and \(0.94\) for \(x=0.75\). As mentioned in the Introduction, in most 122 pnictides, \(\gamma\sim\) 2 close to \(T_{c}\) and decreases to \(\sim\)1 at low temperatures.[16, 22] High-field studies would be required to investigate the low-temperature anisotropy in our crystals.

Assuming the validity of the single-band description in our temperature range, we can calculate the superconducting coherence length (\(\xi\)) by combining (Ref. [27])

\[H_{c2}(T)=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{2\pi\xi^{2}(T)}\quad\mbox{with}\quad\xi\left(T \right)=0.74\frac{\xi_{0}}{\sqrt{1-t}}.\]

Thus,

\[\xi_{0}^{2}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{1.1\pi\,T_{c}}\left[\left.\frac{\partial\,H_{c2}^{ c}}{\partial T}\right|_{T_{c}}\right]^{-1}.\]

We obtain \(\xi_{0}^{c}=3.68\) nm and \(\xi_{0}^{ab}=1.94\) nm for \(x=0.5\), and \(\xi_{0}^{c}=2.08\) nm and \(\xi_{0}^{ab}=1.09\) nm for \(x=0.75\). Although these numbers do not necessarily represent the real \(\xi_{0}\) values at low temperatures, where the multiband effects may become relevant, they do reflect the energy scale associated with the effective superconducting gap in the explored region. From very basic considerations \(\xi_{0}\propto v_{\rm f}/T_{c}\), where \(v_{\rm F}\) is the Fermi velocity. The product \(\xi_{0}T_{c}\) is 71.4 nm K and 69.5 nm K for \(x=0.5\) and 0.75, respectively, indicating that \(v_{\rm F}\) is the same in both crystals within our resolution. In particular, for a weakly coupled BCS superconductor \(\xi_{0}=0.18\frac{\hbar v_{\rm F}}{k_{B}T}\), so in that limit we would obtain \(v_{\rm F}\sim 5\times 10^{6}\) cm/s in both cases.[27]

### D. Lower critical fields

We determined the lower critical fields (\(H_{c1}\)) using SQUID magnetometry. After zero-field cooling of the crystal from above \(T_{c}\) to the desired temperature, we measured the initial magnetization \(M\)(\(H\)). For each \(T\), we identified the field \(H_{\rm dev}\), where \(M\)(\(H\)) deviates from the initial linear dependence \(M=-\frac{V}{4\pi(1-\eta)}H\) corresponding to the Meissner state response (perfect diamagnetism), where \(V\) is the crystal volume and \(\eta\) is the appropriate demagnetizing factor. For both single crystals, we performed these measurements for both \({\bf H}\)\(|\)\(c\) and \({\bf H}\)\(|\)\(ab\), in

Figure 4: (Color online) \(T_{c2}\)(\(H\)) vs angle (\(\Theta\)) at 12 T. \(x=0.5\) (upper panel); \(x=0.75\) (lower panel).

Figure 5: (Color online) Anisotropic scaling of \(H_{c2}\) and \(H_{\rm irr}\) from electrical resistivity, and \(H_{\rm irr}\) from magnetization data with \({\bf H}\)\(|\)\(c\) axis (\(H_{\rm irr}^{M}\)). \(x=0.5\) (upper panel); \(x=0.75\) (lower panel). For \(x=0.75\), the \(H_{\rm irr}\) values obtained from the two definitions sketched in Fig. 2 are included.

  the last case with **H** parallel to the longest crystal dimension \(l\).[26] Using the simple estimates \(\eta_{c}\sim 1-t/l-t/w\) and \(\eta_{ab}\sim t/l\) for **H\(\parallel\)**_c_ and **H\(\parallel\)**_ab_, respectively, we obtain \(\eta_{c}\sim 0.78\) and \(\eta_{ab}\sim 0.028\) for \(x=0.5\), and \(\eta_{c}\sim 0.88\) and \(\eta_{ab}\sim 0.053\) for \(x=0.75\). For both crystals, we used the measured slopes of the linear \(M\) versus \(H\) Meissner responses in both orientations to confirm that the superconducting volumes coincide with the physical volumes (\(l\), \(w\), \(t\)) and that the \(\eta\) factors agree with the calculations within our resolution.

For **H\(\parallel\)**_ab_, we roughly estimated

\[H_{c1}^{ab}(T)=H_{\rm dev}(T)/(1-\eta_{ab})\approx H_{\rm dev}(T).\]

From (Ref. [27])

\[H_{c1}^{ab}\approx\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c}}\left(\ln\kappa+ 0.5\right),\]

where \(\lambda_{ab}\) (\(\lambda_{c}\)) are the London penetration depths for **H\(\parallel\)**_c_ (**H\(\parallel\)**_ab_) and \(\kappa=(\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c}/\xi_{ab}\xi_{c})^{1/2}\) is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, at \(T\)= 5 K we obtain \((\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c})^{1/2}=198\) nm and \(\kappa=82\) for \(x=0.5\), and \((\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c})^{1/2}=136\) nm and \(\kappa=91\) for \(x=0.75\). In principle, we could use the measurements for **H\(\parallel\)**_c_ to determine \(H_{c1}^{c}\) and thus \(\lambda_{ab}\); however, we found that for that orientation, vortex pinning produces a large irreversible magnetization signal (due to the larger demagnetizing effects) that makes the determination of \(H_{\rm dev}\) unreliable.

### Irreversibility lines

To determine the irreversibility field \(H_{\rm irr}(T,\Theta)\), from transport data as that shown in Fig. 2, we identified the point where \(R/R(T_{c},H=0)\) becomes zero for each magnetic field. In \(x=0.75\), we need to take into account the presence of the structure that is visible at all fields. Thus, for each field and orientation, we defined two extrapolations to \(\rho=0\), one from each portion of the transition, as sketched in Fig. 2. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show \(\tilde{H}_{\rm irr}(T)=H_{\rm irr}(T,\Theta)\varepsilon(\Theta)\)for \(x=0.5\) and \(0.75\), respectively. The first observation is that for both crystals all the data collapse on a single curve, as in the case of \(H_{c2}(T,\Theta)\), for the same \(\gamma=1.85\pm 0.05\), consistent with a single-band anisotropic description, and indicating that \(H_{\rm irr}\) is governed random pointlike defects.[28]

The next question is whether \(H_{\rm irr}\) represents a real phase transition, and thus the region between \(\tilde{H}_{\rm irr}(T)\) and \(\tilde{H}_{c2}(T)\) is a vortex liquid phase. In the case of \(x=0.75\), it is apparent from Fig. 5(b) that the \(\tilde{H}_{\rm irr}(T)\) and \(\tilde{H}_{c2}(T)\) curves spread apart monotonically as \(H\) increases [for both criteria used to define \(\tilde{H}_{\rm irr}(T)\)]. Moreover, \(\tilde{H}_{\rm irr}(T)\) exhibits small upward concavity that is absent \(\tilde{H}_{c2}(T)\); fits to \(H\propto(1-T/T_{c})^{n}\) give \(n=1\) for \(H_{c2}\) (as expected for a single-band description) and \(n=1.1\) for \(H_{\rm irr}\). This suggests that \(\tilde{H}_{\rm irr}(T)\) in \(x=0.75\) represents a true solid-liquid phase transition, and in that case the good anisotropic scaling indicates that it is associated with random disorder, similar to the case of a vortex-glass transition. In contrast, if correlated pinning were dominant, a peak in \(H_{\rm irr}(\Theta)\) would appear when **H** is parallel to the defects, as frequently observed in YBCO and as we have recently found in Co-doped 122 films.[14] In the case of \(x=0.5\), the situation is less clear, as the broader transition at \(H=0\) precludes us from reaching a definitive conclusion about the presence of a liquid phase.

It is instructive to compare these results with a simple estimate of the vortex-lattice melting line (\(B_{m}\)) based on the Lindemann criterion

\[B_{m}(T)\approx\left(5.6c_{L}^{4}/G_{i}\right)H_{c2}(1-T/T_{c})^{2},\]

where \(c_{L}\approx 0.1-0.4\) and the Ginzburg number \(G_{i}=\frac{1}{2}[\frac{T_{c}T_{c}}{H(0)^{2}(0)}]^{2}\).[26] Using the experimental values for \(\xi_{ab}\), and assuming that in both crystals \(\lambda_{c}=\gamma\lambda_{ab}\) with \(\gamma=1.85\) (thus \(\lambda_{ab}=146\) nm for \(x=0.5\) and \(100\) nm for \(x=0.75\)), we can estimate \(G_{i}\sim\)1.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) and \(\sim\)3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) for \(x=0.5\) and 0.75, respectively. There is, of course, a very large uncertainty in \(B_{m}(T)\) due to the \(c_{L}^{4}\) factor, but we can consider \(c_{L}=0.1\) and estimate the locus of the lowest possible \(B_{m}(T)\) line. The comparison between our \(H_{\rm irr}(T)\) and \(H_{c2}(T)\) data and such a line is shown in Figs. 6 and 6(b), and it indicates that, according to this simple analysis, a vortex liquid phase is possible in the \(x=0.75\) with \(T_{c}\sim 33.4\) K, whereas this is unlikely in the \(x=0.5\) with \(T_{c}\sim 19.4\) K.

### Magnetization measurements of pinning properties

We determined the magnetic field dependence of the critical-current density [\(J_{c}\left(H\right)\)] for \(x=0.5\) and 0.75 by applying the critical-state Beam model to the magnetization data obtained in hysteresis loops. For **H\(\parallel\)**(i.e., **H** parallel to \(t\), the shortest sample dimension), \(J_{c}=\frac{2\Delta m}{tw(J-w/3)}\), where \(\Delta m\) is the difference in magnetic moment between the top and

Figure 6: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the vortex melting field (\(B_{m}\)) estimated from the Lindemann criterion, and the upper critical fields (\(H_{c2}\)) and irreversibility fields (\(H_{\rm irr}\)) from electrical resistivity with **H\(\parallel\)**_c_ axis in Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Na\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals. \(x=0.5\) (upper panel); \(x=0.75\) (lower panel).

  bottom branches of the hysteresis loop, and \(t\), \(w\), and \(l\) are the thickness, width, and length of the sample (\(l>w\)), respectively. Figure 7 shows a summary of the results for this orientation.

We first discuss the \(x\!=\!0.75\) results [Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)]. At low fields, \(J_{c}\) is independent of \(H\), as seen in the log-log scale in the inset of Fig. 7(a). We will identify this as regime I (the regimes are indicated in Fig. 8, discussed below). As \(H\) increases, we observe that \(J_{c}\) follows a power law \(J_{c}\propto H^{-\alpha}\) with a \(\alpha\!\sim\!0.55\) (regime II) [see inset of Fig. 7(a)]. A regime III shows a field range where \(J_{c}(H)\!\sim\!constant\), which over a wide range of temperatures (\(T<25\) K) extends up to our maximum magnetic field \(H\!\sim\!6.5\) T. Finally, above 25 K, we observe that \(J_{c}\) decreases when \(H\) increases (regime IV), and goes to zero at \(H_{\rm irr}\). Crystal \(x\!=\!0.5\) shows some qualitative similarities. An initial \(J_{c}(H)\!\sim\!constant\) (regime I) is also present, but constrained to even lower \(H\) than in \(x\!=\!0.75\), followed by a field range where \(J_{c}\) decreases with \(H\) (regime II), but no clear power-law dependence is observed. For higher \(H\), another \(J_{c}(H)\!\sim\!constant\) region occurs (regime III), but only at low \(T\) and over a more restricted \(H\) range, and finally \(J_{c}\) decreases with \(H\) (regime IV) until \(J_{c}(H)\!=\!0\) at \(H_{\rm irr}\).

Next, we investigated whether any of these regimes were associated with correlated pinning arising from parallel column-arlike defects, which can occur naturally as in the case of dislocations [29] and domain walls. [30] Although the angular dependence of \(H_{\rm irr}\) rules out measurable correlated pinning in that region of the \(H\)-\(T\) plane, it could still occur significantly deeper in the solid phase. To explore this possibility, we measured hysteresis loops with the \(c\) axis of the crystal tilted by \(30^{\circ}\) from \({\bf H}\). In this configuration, the current flowing along one pair of sides of the rectangular crystal is no longer in maximum Lorentz force configuration, so the effective \(J_{c}\) in those sides (that we chose to be the short ones, \(w\)) is \(J_{c}/{\rm cos}(30^{\circ})\), and using the anisotropic version of the critical-state Bean model, we obtain \(J_{c}=\frac{2\Delta\Delta\Delta}{\mu w(l-\frac{\Delta\Delta}{\mu w(l)})}\). Figure 8 shows the comparison between \(J_{c}\) for \({\bf H}\|c\) axis and \({\bf H}\) rotated \(30^{\circ}\) from the \(c\) axis as a function of \(\varepsilon(\Theta)H\), the effective field in the anisotropic scaling scheme, with \(\gamma\!=\!1.85\) as obtained from transport measurements. We observe an almost perfect coincidence between data at both orientations for all temperatures and fields, indicating that \(J_{c}(H,\Theta)\!=\!J_{c}[\varepsilon(\Theta)H]\) as expected in a scenario based on random disorder and the anisotropic scaling approach, and ruling out the presence of correlated pinning.

## IV Discussion

### Analysis of the pinning mechanisms

Some previous studies of \(J_{c}(H)\) in hole- and electron-doped 122 single crystals showed the presence of a second peak in the magnetization (SPM), known as fishtail effect, [31] which occurs for \({\bf H}\|c\) but is absent for \({\bf H}\bot c\). [32] This SPM was attributed to small-size normal-core pinning. Also, vortex creep analysis suggests that it results from a crossover from elastic to plastic creep. [32] We do not observe a SPM in our crystals at any temperature or field orientation, pointing to different pinning mechanisms and/or regimes. It is, thus,

Figure 7: (Color online) (a) Critical-current density (\(J_{c}\)) as a function of magnetic field (\(H\)) in Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Na\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals. (a) and (b) \(x=0.75\). (c) and (d) \(x=0.5\). Insets in (a) and (c) show log-log plots.

  important to compare and contrast our samples with those of previous reports and to explore their pinning properties in detail.

It is clear that the whole \(J_{c}(H)\) curves shown in Figs. 7 and 8 can not be explained using a single type of pinning centers. Similarly to what is observed in many superconductors, regime I can be associated with single-vortex pinning, crossing over to regime II (\(J_{c}\propto H^{-\alpha}\)) when the vortex density increases to the point that their interactions become important. But then, the next \(J_{c}(H)\!\sim\!constant\) (regime III) can not arise from single-vortex pinning by the same defects, thus more than one source of pinning must be at play in these crystals. The simplest possibility is that regimes I and II are due to a sparse distribution of strong random defects, and regime III to a denser collection of smaller and weaker defects.

### Regimes I and II

The vortex pinning produced by a random distribution of particles larger than \(\xi\) was discussed by van der Beek _et al._,[33] who predicted a power law with \(\alpha\!=\!5/8\!=\!0.625\) (previous studies made similar predictions with \(\alpha\!=\!\frac{1}{2}\)).[34] For noninteractive vortices (low \(H\)) \(J_{c}\approx 0.14n^{1/2}\gamma[DF(T)]^{3/2}J_{0}\), where \(n\) is the density of the pinning particles, \(D\) is their diameter (assuming that they are spherical), \(F(T)\!\approx\!\ln[1+D^{2}/8\xi^{2}(T)]\), and \(J_{0}\!=\!cH_{c}/3\sqrt{6\pi}\lambda\) is the depairing current density.[33] For a simple estimate, we can take \(F(T)\!\sim\!1\) (a good approximation for \(D\) a few times \(\xi\)), thus \([DF(T)]^{3/2}\sim(2v)^{1/2}\), where \(v\) is the volume of one particle, and \(J_{c}\approx 0.14\gamma(2nv)^{1/2}J_{0}\). Note that \(nv\) is the fraction of the volume occupied by the defects. Using our experimental \(\xi\) and \(\lambda\) values, we estimate \(J_{0}(5\mbox{K})\approx 500\) M A cm\({}^{-2}\), and from Fig. 7(a) \(J_{c}(5\mbox{K})\approx 1\) M A cm\({}^{-2}\), thus \(m\!\sim\!4\,\times\,10^{-5}\) not surprisingly indicating that a rather small volume fraction of strong pinning centers is enough to account for the observed \(J_{c}/J_{0}\!\sim\!2\,\times\,10^{-3}\). (For comparison, the BaZrO\({}_{3}\) inclusions that are frequently used to increase \(J_{c}\) in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) films produce optimum results for volume fractions \(\sim\!0.05\).[35] These strong-pinning defects could appear spontaneously during the single-crystal growth[36] or, alternatively, this behavior could be associated with phase-separated coexistence of AFM and superconducting and normal states as previously observed in (BaK)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals.[37]

The crossover between the single-vortex limit where \(J_{c}\) is independent of \(H\) and the interacting power-law regime should occur at a field \(B^{*}\approx\pi\Phi_{0}n(U_{p}/\varepsilon_{0})\), where \(U_{p}\approx\varepsilon_{0}DF(T)/4\) is the pinning energy of one nanoparticle and \(\varepsilon_{0}\) is the vortex energy scale. By combining with the \(J_{c}\) result, we obtain \(B^{*}\approx 3\Phi_{0}(n/\gamma)^{2/3}(J_{c}/J_{0})^{2/3}\), so ideally we could determine \(n\) from the crossover between regimes I and II. Unfortunately, our experimental \(B^{*}\) is likely affected by self-field effects, as indicated by the fact that for each temperature \(B^{*}(T)\!\sim\!J_{c}(T)\), thus, we only have an upper limit for the crossover field, for instance, from \(B^{*}(5\mbox{ K})\!\leq\!0.2\) T, we obtain \(n\!\leq\!2\,\times\,10^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\).

It should be noted that, according to Koshelev,[3]\(J_{c}(\Theta)\) for nanoparticle pinning does not follow the anisotropic scaling, and in fact depends on both \(\gamma\) and the shape (aspect ratio of main dimensions) of the particles. For instance, for spherical particles (we have no reason to assume otherwise) below \(B^{*}\), he finds \(J_{c}(\Theta)\propto(\cos^{2}\Theta+\gamma^{-2}\sin^{2}\Theta)^{1/4}\), but for \(\Theta\!=\!30^{\circ}\), this factor is \(\sim\!0.95\), too close to 1 to be detectable in our measurements.

According to existing models, regime III can not arise from the same nanoparticles that generate the \(\alpha\!=\!5/8\) (or \(1/2\)) regime; instead, above regime II, the models predict another power-law region with \(\alpha\!=\!1\), which we do not observe.[33] A natural interpretation is that, as the nanoparticle pinning decreases with increasing \(H\), a new pinning source becomes dominant. The obvious possibility is a much denser distribution of smaller random defects.

### Regime III

We could try to describe regime III in terms of the collective pinning by random _point_ disorder as described by the Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) theory,[39] which is consistent with both the low \(J_{c}\) and the anisotropic scaling. However, we find a serious numerical discrepancy regarding the upper boundary of this single-vortex pinning regime. In \(x\!=\!0.75\), regime III is visible over a wide range of temperatures, \(5\mbox{ K}<T<25\mbox{ K}\), all the way up to our maximum magnetic field \(\mu_{0}H\!\sim\!6.5\mbox{ T}\), and at \(30\mbox{ K}\) it is still visible over a restricted field range. In the LO scenario, \(J_{c}\) in the single-vortex regime (where \(J_{c}\) is independent of \(H\)) is determined by the collective pinning length (Larkin length \(L_{c}\)), and the crossover to the collective pinning of vortex bundles (3D) occurs at a field \(B_{sb}\) such that the vortex lattice parameter \(\mbox{a}_{0}\!\sim\!L_{c}\). According to Blatter _et al._,[26] in an anisotropic superconductor for \({\bf H}\|c\), we have \(L_{c}^{c}\!=\!\gamma^{-1}\xi(J_{0}/J_{c})^{1/2}\) and \(B_{sb}\!=\!\beta_{sb}\frac{J_{c}}{J_{0}}\,H_{c2}\), with \(\beta_{sb}\approx 5\). In regime III, \(J_{c}(5\mbox{ K})\!\sim\!2.5\,\times\,10^{5}\mbox{ A}\!=\!\gamma^{-2}\) and \(J_{c}(25\mbox{ K})\!\sim\!4\,\times\,10^{4}\mbox{ A}\!=\!\gamma^{-2}\), with \(J_{0}(5\mbox{ K})\!\sim\!500\mbox{ M A cm}^{-2}\) and \(J_{0}(25\mbox{ K})\!\sim\!110\mbox{ M A cm}^{-2}\)  Alternatively, we can again describe this dense distribution of random defects in the van der Beek nanoparticles scenario, thus,

\[\begin{array}{l} B^{*}\approx 3\Phi_{0}(n/\gamma)^{2/3}(J_{c}/J_{0})^{2/3}\\ \approx 18\gamma^{-2/3}(\xi/d)^{2}(J_{c}/J_{0})^{2/3}H_{c2},\end{array}\]

where \(d\) is the average distance between nanoparticles. In this case, the weaker dependence on _Jc/J_0 as compared to the LO model allows us to estimate a higher value _B_*(5 K)~(5_T_)(_x_/_d_)2, but even for a very dense distribution, we can get at most _B_*~1 T, closer but still below the experimental result (>6.5 T).

To summarize, the regime III in \(x\) = 0.75 can not be explained by the LO scenario for single-vortex pinning. Considering the numerical uncertainties involved in the analysis, the van der Beek model could be marginally consistent with the observed _B_* if we assume a very dense distribution of smaller nanoparticles. It is still possible that this regime arises from a single type of disorder, but we lack of the correct model to describe it. A more interesting alternative is that a mixed pinning landscape is involved. A _Jc_(_H_)~_constant_ is usually associated with single-vortex pinning, but in more general terms, it is consistent with an interactive vertex regime if the volume of the bundle is independent of \(H\). Although this is not the case for a single type of disorder, we propose that it may occur due to the simultaneous presence of sparse large (strong) nanoparticles and a much denser distribution of smaller particles or pointlike pinning. In this scenario, the sparse pins could produce a caging effect, constraining the volume of the vortex bundle associated with the denser and weaker defects. This points to the importance of improving our understanding of mixed pinning landscapes and hierarchies of pinning scales, and deserves further study. In particular, flux creep studies should provide complementary information.

This scenario is supported by previous studies in pnictide single crystals, which indicate that different kinds of disorder such as phase-separated coexistence of AFM and superconducting and normal states,37 crystalline defect such as twin domains, impurities, or precipitation, and nanoscopic secondary phases40 have an important role in the vortex dynamic. Also, a similar scenario has been proposed in YBCO thin films where the vortices sense the pinning potential from correlated defects along the _ab_ plane as well as the _intrinsic pinning_ from a much larger density of weaker pinning centers. After an initial fall with \(H\), _Jc_(**H**||_ab_) stays flat.41

### Regime IV

To investigate regime IV, where _Jc_(_H_) decreases to zero, we have analyzed the field dependence of the pinning force \(F_{P}\) = _Jc H_. It has long been known that,42 if the same pinning mechanism dominates over a certain temperature range, frequently \(F_{P}\)(_H_,_T_) can be scaled as \(F_{P}/F_{P,\max} = Ah^{m}(1 - h)^{l}\), where \(F_{P}\),\(\max\) is the maximum \(F_{P}\)(_H_) at each temperature, \(A\) is a constant, \(m\) and \(l\) are exponents that depend on the pinning mechanism, and \(h\) = _H_/_H_c2(_T_). The absence of scaling indicates that different pinning mechanisms occur over the \(T\) range investigated. Figure 9 shows the _F__P_/_F__P_,\(\max\)(_h_) dependence for \(x\) = 0.5 and 0.75. Following a common procedure for HTS and iron arsenides, we have used _H_itr(_T_) instead of _H_c2(_T_) in the definition of \(h\). The \(x\) = 0.5 [see Figs. 9 and 9(b)] presents a clear change in the pinning mechanism between 8 and 10 K, as evidenced by a shift in the field where the maximum \(F_{P}\) occurs (_h_max), from ~0.5 to ~0.25 as \(T\) is increased from 8 to 10 K. The graphs only include data for \(T\) > 8 K, the range where we can estimate _H_itr. In the case of \(x\) = 0.75, we are constrained to \(T\) >= 30 K. In this narrow range, we observe _h_max~0.5. Previous studies in FeAs superconductors have reported _F__P_/_F__P_,\(\max\)(_h_) with different _h_max, for example, _h_max~0.33 and 0.43 in (Ba,K)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\), or _h_max~0.5 and 0.37 in Co-doped BaFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\),20,43,44 suggesting that the sample preparation process affects the mechanism that determines the pinning. In our study, we found that differences in doping also affect the vortex dynamics and pinning mechanisms. It is tempting to relate the functional form of _F__P_/_F__P_,\(\max\)(_h_) to a microscopic pinning mechanism as was done for conventional superconductors, but such analysis is valid for \(h\) defined using _H_c2(_T_) rather than _H_itr(_T_), so it can not be directly applied here.

### Comparison with pinning mechanisms in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\)

It is worth comparing the vortex pinning in our FeAs superconductors with those in cuprates, particularly with YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (YBCO). The _Jc_(_H_) curves at low \(T\) for clean YBCO single crystals frequently resemble those of Fig. 7 in several regards, showing a small _Jc_~_constant_ at low H, followed by a decreasing _Jc_(_H_) and then another _Jc_~_constant_ region at higher \(H\). In some studies, this regime III was found to extend up to several Tesla (for \(T\) < 20 K),45 and repeating the above analysis [for _Jc_(5 K)~0.5-1 M A cm-2, _Jc_(5 K)~300 M A cm-2, and _Hc_(5 K)~120 T], we find \(B_{b}\)(5 K)~1-2 T, again lower than the experimentally observed upper bound of the regime III, although the discrepancy is much smaller than in the FeAs crystals of this study. The _B_* estimate for a very dense distribution of nanoparticles, on the other hand, could explain the regime III in YBCO. At intermediate temperatures, many YBCO crystals show a SPM, attributed to various crystallographic defects such as oxygen deficiency or antiphase boundaries, but it has been shown that the SPM can be removed by annealing,46 leaving a much reduced _Jc_~_constant_ component. A similar relation between the SPM and the high field _Jc_~_constant_ may occur in the pnictides.

The comparison with YBCO films is more difficult. An important difference is that _Jc_ in YBCO films is much higher than either in YBCO or FeAs single crystals, reaching a significant fraction of the depairing limit. In general, films show an initial _Jc_~_constant_ regime followed by a decreasing _Jc_(_H_), but no regime III at high fields. This may be simply because the "low-field" component of the pinning is much stronger and remains significant up to fields approaching _H_itr. Depending on the deposition method, some standard YBCO films show a power-law regime with similar \(a\) values than our 122 crystals, even though nanoparticles are not present (at least in significant densities). In those cases, the _a_~0.5-0.6 is associated with random defects and/or combination of those with _c_-axis correlated disorder (dislocations, twin boundaries).

  On the other hand, YBCO films in which a large density of nanoparticles is the dominant pinning source show no power-law dependence.[47; 48]

## V Conclusions

In conclusion, we have investigated the effect of Na doping on the superconducting properties of Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Na\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) single crystals. The maximum \(T_{c}\) in this material corresponds to a chemical doping different from (Ba,K)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) and (Sr,K)Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\). Scaling of the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) versus \(T\) indicates that our samples show a single-band-like behavior close to \(T_{c}\) with a \(\gamma=1.85\pm 0.05\), independently of the chemical doping and \(T_{c}\) value. A narrow vortex liquid phase was detected in the sample with highest \(T_{c}\) (\(x=0.75\)), in agreement with the expectations from the superconducting properties \(T_{c}\), H\({}_{c2}\), and \(G_{i}\). The field and angular dependence of the critical-current density in both the underdoped and optimally doped single crystals indicates that pinning arises from a combination of several mechanisms. At low fields, pinning by random nanoparticles dominates. At higher fields, a small and field independent \(J_{c}\) in the optimally doped crystal may originate in the simultaneous presence of sparse large nanoparticles and a much denser distribution of smaller particles, with the sparse pins producing a caging effect that constrains the volume of the vortex bundle associated with the denser and weaker defects. No evidence of directional pinning by correlated disorder is observed. More studies are necessary in order to understand the influence of the different crystalline defects on the vortex pinning and dynamics of these materials.
