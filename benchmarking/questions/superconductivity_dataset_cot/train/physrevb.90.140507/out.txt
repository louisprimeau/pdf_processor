###### Abstract

The magnetic penetration depth (\lambda) as a function of applied magnetic field and temperature in SrPt_{3}P (T_{c}\simeq 8.4 K) was studied by means of muon-spin rotation (\muSR). The dependence of \lambda^{-2} on temperature suggests the existence of a single s-wave energy gap with the zero-temperature value \Delta_{0}=1.55(2) meV. At the same time \lambda was found to be strongly field dependent which is the characteristic feature of the nodal gap and/or multiband systems. The multiband nature of the superconducting state is further suggested by the upward curvature of the upper critical field. This apparent contradiction is resolved by SrPt_{3}P being a particular two-band superconductor with equal gaps but different coherence lengths within the two Fermi surface sheets.

After the discovery of the first Fe-based superconductors enormous efforts were made to improve their superconducting properties. The intensive search led to the discovery of several Fe-based materials (see, e.g., Ref. [1] for review and references therein) and related compounds such as BaNi_{2}As_{2}[2], SrNi_{2}As_{2}[3], SrPt_{2}As_{2}[4], and SrPtAs [5], without Fe and relatively low superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}'s.

Recently, Takayama _et al._[6] reported the synthesis of a new family of ternary platinum phosphide superconductors with the chemical formula \text{AP}_{\text{t}}\text{y}P (A=\text{Sr}, Ca, and La) and T_{c}'s of 8.4, 6.6, and 1.5 K, respectively. Theoretical studies on the pairing mechanism in these new compounds gave partially contradicting results [7,9]. The authors of Ref. [7] performed first-principles calculations and proposed that superconductivity is caused by the proximity to a dynamical charge-density wave instability, and that a strong spin-orbit coupling leads to exotic pairing in at least LaPt_{3}P. In contrast, the first-principles calculations and Migdal-Eliashberg analysis performed by Subedi _et al._[9] suggest conventional phonon-mediated superconductivity. Also experimentally seemingly contradicting results were obtained. Based on the observation of nonlinear temperature behavior of the Hall resistivity, the authors of Ref. [6] suggest multiband superconductivity in these new compounds. Note that the presence of two bands crossing the Fermi level was indeed revealed by _ab initio_ band structure calculations presented in [7,9,10,11]. On the other hand the specific-heat data of SrPt_{3}P were found to be well described within a single-band, single s-wave gap approach with the zero-temperature gap value of \Delta_{0}=1.85 meV [6].

In this Rapid Communication we report on the results of muon-spin rotation (\muSR) studies of the magnetic penetration depth (\lambda) as a function of temperature and magnetic field of the novel superconductor SrPt_{3}P. Below T\simeq T_{c}/2 the superfluid density (\rho_{s}\propto\lambda^{-2}) becomes temperature independent which is consistent with a fully gapped superconducting state. The full temperature dependence of \rho_{s}(T) is well described within a single s-wave gap scenario with the zero-temperature gap value \Delta_{0}=1.55(2) meV. On the other hand, \lambda was found to increase with increasing magnetic field as is observed in multiband superconductors or superconductors with nodes in the energy gap function. The upper critical field shows a pronounced upward curvature thus pointing to a multiband nature of the superconducting state of SrPt_{3}P. Our results indicate that SrPt_{3}P is a two-band superconductor with equal gaps but different coherence length parameters \xi_{i} for the two Fermi surface sheets.

The sample preparation and the magnetization experiments were performed at the ETH-Zurich. Polycrystalline samples of SrPt_{3}P were prepared using the cubic anvil high-pressure and high-temperature technique. Coarse powders of Sr, Pt, and P elements of high purity (99.99%) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio 1:3:1, thoroughly ground, and enclosed in a boron nitride container, which was placed inside a pyrophyllite cube with a graphite heater. All procedures related to the sample preparation were performed in an argon-filled glove box. In a typical run, a pressure of 2 GPa was applied at room temperature. While keeping the pressure constant, the temperature was ramped up in 2 h to the maximum value of 1050 ^{\circ}C, maintained for 20-40 h, and then decreased to room temperature in 1 h. Afterward, the pressure was released, and the sample was removed. All high-pressure prepared samples demonstrate large diamagnetic response with the superconducting transition temperature of \simeq8.4 K (see the inset in Fig. 1). The powder x-ray diffraction patterns are consistent with those reported in Ref. [6].

Measurements of the upper critical field B_{c2} were performed using a Quantum Design 7 T SQUID magnetometer. The temperature dependence of B_{c2} was obtained from field-cooled magnetization curves [M_{\text{FC}}(T)] measured in constant magnetic fields ranging from 0.3 mT to 4 T (see Fig. 1 and Sec. S1 in the Supplemental Material [8]). The B_{c2}(T) curve exhibits a pronounced upward curvature around \sim6-6.5 K. Linear fits of B_{c2}(T) in the vicinity of T_{c} and for T\leqslant 6 K yield B_{c2}/dT=-0.49 and -0.77 T/K, respectively. Open circles correspond to B_{c2}(T) data points from Ref. [6]. They are in perfect agreement with our data thus implying that the upturn on B_{c2}(T) reported here is indeed a generic property of the SrPt_{3}P compound. Note that an upward curvature of B_{c2}(T) was also observed previously for a number of materials such as Nb [12,13], V [12], NbSe_{2}[14,15,16], MgB_{2}[17,18,19], borocarbides and nitrides [20,21,22], heavy fermion systems [23], and various iron-based [24; 25; 26] and cuprate superconductors [27; 28], and was often associated with two-band superconductivity.

The temperature and the magnetic field dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda were obtained from transverse-field (TF) \muSR data [29]. The experiments were carried out at the \pi_E_1 beam line at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The data were analyzed using the free software package musrfit[30]. In a polycrystalline sample the magnetic penetration depth \lambda can be extracted from the Gaussian muon-spin depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm sc}(T)\sim\lambda^{-2}, which reflects the second moment (\sigma_{\rm sc}^{2}/\gamma_{\mu}^{2}, \gamma_{\mu} is the muon gyromagnetic ratio) of the magnetic field distribution due to the flux-line lattice (FLL) in the mixed state [31; 32; 33]. The TF-\muSR data were analyzed using the asymmetry function

\[A(t) = A_{\rm sc}\exp\big{[}-(\sigma_{\rm sc}^{2}+\sigma_{\rm s}^{2})t ^{2}/2\big{]}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{\rm sc}t+\phi)\] (1) \[+A_{b}\exp\big{(}-\sigma_{b}^{2}t^{2}/2\big{)}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B _{b}t+\phi).\]

The first term of Eq. (1) represents the response of the superconducting part of the sample. Here A_{\rm sc} denotes the initial asymmetry; \sigma_{\rm sc} is the Gaussian relaxation rate due to the FLL; \sigma_{\rm s} is the contribution to the field distribution arising from the nuclear moment and which is found to be temperature independent, in agreement with the ZF results (not shown); B_{\rm int} is the internal magnetic field sensed by the muons and \phi is the initial phase of the muon-spin ensemble. The second term with the initial asymmetry A_{b}, small \sigma_{b}<0.3\mus^{-1} and B_{b} close to the applied field corresponds to the background muons stopping in the cryostat and in nonsuperconducting parts of the sample.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of \sigma_{\rm sc} at T=1.7 K as a function of the applied magnetic field B. Each data point was obtained after cooling the sample in the corresponding field from above T_{c} to 1.7 K. The overall decrease of \sigma_{\rm sc} with increasing applied field is partially caused by the decreased width of the internal field distribution upon approaching B_{c2}. To quantify such an effect, one can make use of the numerical Ginzburg-Landau model, developed by Brandt [34]. This model predicts the magnetic field dependence of the second moment of the magnetic field distribution, i.e., the \muSR depolarization rate:

\[\sigma_{\rm sc}\ [\mus^{-1}] = 4.83\times 10^{4}(1-B/B_{c2})\] (2) \[\times[1+1.21(1-\sqrt{B/B_{c2}})^{3}]\lambda^{-2}\ [{\rm nm}^{-2}].\]

Under the assumption of field-independent \lambda the dependence of \sigma_{\rm sc} on B was analyzed by using the values of the upper critical field B_{c2} as obtained in magnetization experiments [B_{c2}(1.7) K \simeq 4.5 T, see Fig. 1]. It is clear that the theoretical \sigma(B), which is presented in Fig. 2 by the dashed line, is not in agreement with the data.

The dependence of \sigma_{\rm sc} on B was further analyzed using the two-component model proposed by Serventi _et al._[35]. The model considers the independent contributions of two bands. Each band is characterized by its own coherence length (\xi_{1},\xi_{2}), while the parameter w_{1}=\rho_{x,1}/\rho_{x} accounts for the contribution of the first band into the total superfluid density (see Ref. [35] and Sec. S2 in the Supplemental Material [8]). The results of the fit with \lambda=134(2) nm, w=0.72(2), \xi_{1}=8.6 nm, and \xi_{2}=26 nm are presented in Fig. 2 by the solid red line.

The temperature dependences of \lambda^{-2} for \mu_{0}H=0.05,0.15, 0.3, and 0.45 T were obtained from measured \sigma_{\rm sc}(T)'s (the inset in Fig. 2) and B_{c2}(T) (Fig. 1) using Eq. (2). Figure 3 shows \lambda^{-2}(T) normalized to its value averaged over the temperature range 1.7-3.5 K as a function of T/T_{c}(B). All data curves

The dotted lines are linear fits of B_{c2}(T) in the vicinity of T_{c} and for T\leqslant 6 K. Open circles are B_{c2}(T) data points from Ref. [6]. The inset shows the temperature dependence of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization measured at \mu_{0}H=0.3 mT.

The dashed black line represents \sigma_{\rm sc}(B) as expected within the model of Brandt [34] for \lambda=162(4) nm and B_{c2}=4.5 T obtained in magnetization experiments. The red solid line is the fit by means of the two-component model from Ref. [35] with the parameters \xi_{1}=8.6 nm, \xi_{2}=26 nm, \lambda=134(2) nm, and w=0.72(2); see Sec. S2 in the Supplemental Material [8]. The inset shows the temperature dependence of the depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm sc} caused by the formation of FLL in SrPt_{3}P in fields of 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.45 T.

  merge into the single line. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the field dependence of \lambda^{-2} for T=1.7,4.1, and 6.1 K.

First we will discuss the temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2}. It is seen that below approximately one half of T_{c}, \lambda^{-2} is temperature independent. The solid line in Fig. 3 represents a fit with the weak-coupling BCS model [36]:

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=\frac{\rho_{s}(T)}{\rho_{s}(0)}=1+2 \int_{\Delta(T)}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)\frac{E\,dE} {\sqrt{E^{2}-\Delta(T)^{2}}}.\] (3)

Here \lambda^{-2}(0) and \rho_{s}(0) are the zero-temperature values of the magnetic penetration depth and the superfluid density, respectively, and f=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function. The temperature dependence of the gap is approximated by \Delta(T)/\Delta_{0}=\tanh[1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T)-1]^{0.51}][37], where \Delta_{0} is the maximum gap value at T=0. The fit results in \Delta_{0}(B)/k_{B}T_{c}(B)=4.28(5), \lambda^{-2}(T)/\lambda^{-2}(1.7-3.5 K)=1.021(6), and T/T_{c}(B)=0.972(3). For T_{c}(B=0)\simeq 8.4 K (see Fig. 1) we get \Delta_{0}(B=0)=1.55(2) meV. Note that this value of the superconducting gap is close to \Delta_{0}=1.85 meV obtained from zero-field specific-heat data by Takayama _et al._[6].

It is noteworthy that there is no need to introduce more than one gap parameter or to consider more complicated gap symmetry in order to satisfactorily describe \lambda^{-2}(T) data. Fits using gap functions containing nodes result in higher \chi^{2} than that obtained for the simple s-wave gap model described above (see Sec. S3a in the Supplemental Material [8]). A fit using the anisotropic s-wave gap function results in \chi^{2} comparable to that of the s-wave model with an almost constant zero-temperature gap value (1.50 \leqslant\Delta_{0}\leqslant 1.60 meV, see Sec. S3a in the Supplemental Material [8]). From the analysis of \lambda^{-2}(T) data alone one could therefore conclude that SrPt_{3}P is a a single-band s-wave superconductor. Note that a similar conclusion was reached by Takayama _et al._[6] based on specific-heat data. In the following we will suggest that this was a premature conclusion obtained without considering the field dependence of \lambda.

As follows from the inset in Fig. 3, the field increase from 0.05 up to 0.45 T leads to the decrease of \lambda^{-2} by almost a factor of 2. In single-band s-wave superconductors, \lambda is _independent_ of the magnetic field [32, 37, 38, 39]. A dependence of \lambda on B is expected for superconductors containing nodes in the energy gap or/and multiband superconductors [33, 38, 40, 41, 42]. In the latter case the superfluid density within one series of bands is expected to be suppressed faster by the magnetic field than within the others [41, 42].

The single s-wave gap behavior of \lambda^{-2}(T) (see Fig. 3 and the discussion above) and the multiband features following after the upper critical field B_{\xi 2} and \lambda^{-2}(B) measurements (Figs. 1 and 2 and the inset in Fig. 3) reveal that SrPt_{3}P is a _two-band_ superconductor with energy gaps being _equal_ within both bands [43]. Within a two-band model the deviation from the simple field independence of \lambda as well as the appearance of the upward curvature of the upper critical field could reflect the occurrence of two distinct coherence lengths \xi_{1} and \xi_{2} for two bands (associated with the corresponding upper critical field values B_{\xi 2,i}=\phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi_{i}^{2}) [35, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46]. Following BCS, the zero-temperature coherence length obeys the relation \xi\propto(v_{F})/\Delta_{0} (where v_{F}) is the averaged value of the Fermi velocity). One could assume, therefore, that in SrPt_{3}P the difference between \xi_{1} and \xi_{2} is caused by the different Fermi velocities ((v_{F,1})\neq(v_{F,2})), while the gaps remain the same (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}).

The statement about different (v_{F})'s in two Fermi surface sheets of SrPt_{3}P is fully confirmed by the calculated band structure [7, 9, 10, 11]. According to Refs. [7, 9, 10, 11] there are two bands crossing the Fermi level having significantly different v_{F}'s. The ratio of v_{F}'s is, e.g., \simeq2 along \Gamma-X and \sim3-4 along \Gamma-Z directions of the Brillouin zone. It is worth noting that different Fermi velocities on the different bands are expected to be a general feature of multiband superconductors as, e.g., MgB_{2}[47, 48, 49], borocarbides [21, 49], Fe-based superconductors [50, 51], etc.

Note that the SrPt_{3}P studied here is distinctly different from the "textbook" two-band superconductor MgB_{2} in a particular way. In SrPt_{3}P the charge carriers in both bands are expected to be almost equally strongly coupled to the phonons. Indeed, according to the band structure calculations of Nekrasov _et al._[10] the carriers in two bands correspond to the relatively _similar_pd\pi antibonding states of Pt(I)-P and Pt(II)-P ions, and are coupled to the _same_ low-lying phonon modes confined to the _ab_ plane. In contrast, in MgB_{2} only the \sigma band carriers are coupled strongly to E_{Eg} phonons, while the coupling of both, the \sigma and the \pi, bands to the harmonic B_{1g}, A_{2u}, and E_{1u} phonons is negligible [52]. Therefore, MgB_{2} and SrPt_{3}P correspond to two limiting cases of two-band superconductivity with the energy gaps being nonequal (\Delta_{1}\neq\Delta_{2}, as in MgB_{2}) and equal (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}, as in SrPt_{3}P). At the same time SrPt_{3}P remains the "true" two-band superconductor since, due to nonequal Fermi velocities (\langle v_{F,i}\rangle\neq\langle v_{F,2}\rangle), the carriers in various bands "respond" differently to the magnetic field [as shown here based on B_{\xi 2}(T) and \lambda(B) studies and by Takayama _et al._[6] based on the temperature dependence of the Hall resistivity].

Figure 3: (Color online) \lambda^{-2}(T) normalized to its value averaged over the temperature range 1.7–3.5 K as a function of T/T_{c}(B). The solid line is the fit obtained by using the weak-coupling BCS model [see Eq. (3)]. The inset shows the dependence of \lambda^{-2} on the applied field at T=1.7, 4.1, and 6.1 K.

  By following the above presented arguments we propose a schematic diagram describing relations between the single-, two-, and multiband superconductivities (see Fig. 4). The single-band superconductor has essentially one gap value and one average Fermi velocity (\langle v_{F}\rangle). There are two types of two-band superconductors with energy gaps being equal (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}) or nonequal (\Delta_{1}\neq\Delta_{2}). Both of these types are characterized, however, by nonequal \langle v_{F}\rangle's. The way to multiband superconductors may proceed by different routes. (i) All gaps in all bands crossing the Fermi level are equal (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}\ldots=\Delta_{n}). This is might be the case for the optimally doped LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} having five Fermi surfaces (as most other Fe-based superconductors, see, e.g., Ref. [1] and references therein). As shown by Luetkens _et al._[53] the temperature evolution of the superfluid density of LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} is well described within the single s-wave gap approach, while \lambda^{-2} depends strongly on the magnetic field. It should be noted, however, that the presence of two distinct gaps in LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} was reported by Gonnelli _et al._[54] based on the result of point contact Andreev reflection experiment. (ii) Gaps in some Fermi sheets are equal but in others are not (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}\cdots=\Delta_{k}\neq\Delta_{k+1}\cdots\neq\Delta_{n}). A good example is the optimally doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} where three gaps are equal (\simeq9 meV) while the last gap was found to be approximately eight times smaller (\simeq1.1 meV) [55, 55]. (iii) Gaps in all the Fermi sheets are different (\Delta_{1}\neq\Delta_{2}\cdots\neq\Delta_{n}).

To summarize, the temperature and the magnetic field dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda in the SrPt_{3}P superconductor (T_{c}\simeq 8.4 K) were studied by means of muon-spin rotation. Below T\simeq T_{c}/2 the superfluid density \rho_{i}\propto\lambda^{-2} is temperature independent which is consistent with a fully gapped superconducting state. The full \rho_{s}(T) is well described within the single s-wave gap scenario with the zero-temperature gap value \Delta_{0}=1.55(2) meV. However, \lambda was found to be strongly field dependent well below the upper critical field B_{c2}. This puzzle is reconciled by invoking a two-component model analysis with different characteristic length scales \xi_{1} and \xi_{2}. To conclude, our results suggests that SrPt_{3}P is a representative of a new class of multiband superconductors.

###### Abstract

The magnetic penetration depth (\lambda) as a function of applied magnetic field and temperature in SrPt_{3}P (T_{c}\simeq 8.4 K) was studied by means of muon-spin rotation (\muSR). The dependence of \lambda^{-2} on temperature suggests the existence of a single s-wave energy gap with the zero-temperature value \Delta_{0}=1.55(2) meV. At the same time \lambda was found to be strongly field dependent which is the characteristic feature of the nodal gap and/or multiband systems. The multiband nature of the superconducting state is further suggested by the upward curvature of the upper critical field. This apparent contradiction is resolved by SrPt_{3}P being a particular two-band superconductor with equal gaps but different coherence lengths within the two Fermi surface sheets.

After the discovery of the first Fe-based superconductors enormous efforts were made to improve their superconducting properties. The intensive search led to the discovery of several Fe-based materials (see, e.g., Ref. [1] for review and references therein) and related compounds such as BaNi_{2}As_{2}[2], SrNi_{2}As_{2}[3], SrPt_{2}As_{2}[4], and SrPtAs [5], without Fe and relatively low superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}'s.

Recently, Takayama _et al._[6] reported the synthesis of a new family of ternary platinum phosphide superconductors with the chemical formula \text{AP}_{\text{t}}\text{y}P (A=\text{Sr}, Ca, and La) and T_{c}'s of 8.4, 6.6, and 1.5 K, respectively. Theoretical studies on the pairing mechanism in these new compounds gave partially contradicting results [7,9]. The authors of Ref. [7] performed first-principles calculations and proposed that superconductivity is caused by the proximity to a dynamical charge-density wave instability, and that a strong spin-orbit coupling leads to exotic pairing in at least LaPt_{3}P. In contrast, the first-principles calculations and Migdal-Eliashberg analysis performed by Subedi _et al._[9] suggest conventional phonon-mediated superconductivity. Also experimentally seemingly contradicting results were obtained. Based on the observation of nonlinear temperature behavior of the Hall resistivity, the authors of Ref. [6] suggest multiband superconductivity in these new compounds. Note that the presence of two bands crossing the Fermi level was indeed revealed by _ab initio_ band structure calculations presented in [7,9,10,11]. On the other hand the specific-heat data of SrPt_{3}P were found to be well described within a single-band, single s-wave gap approach with the zero-temperature gap value of \Delta_{0}=1.85 meV [6].

In this Rapid Communication we report on the results of muon-spin rotation (\muSR) studies of the magnetic penetration depth (\lambda) as a function of temperature and magnetic field of the novel superconductor SrPt_{3}P. Below T\simeq T_{c}/2 the superfluid density (\rho_{s}\propto\lambda^{-2}) becomes temperature independent which is consistent with a fully gapped superconducting state. The full temperature dependence of \rho_{s}(T) is well described within a single s-wave gap scenario with the zero-temperature gap value \Delta_{0}=1.55(2) meV. On the other hand, \lambda was found to increase with increasing magnetic field as is observed in multiband superconductors or superconductors with nodes in the energy gap function. The upper critical field shows a pronounced upward curvature thus pointing to a multiband nature of the superconducting state of SrPt_{3}P. Our results indicate that SrPt_{3}P is a two-band superconductor with equal gaps but different coherence length parameters \xi_{i} for the two Fermi surface sheets.

The sample preparation and the magnetization experiments were performed at the ETH-Zurich. Polycrystalline samples of SrPt_{3}P were prepared using the cubic anvil high-pressure and high-temperature technique. Coarse powders of Sr, Pt, and P elements of high purity (99.99%) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio 1:3:1, thoroughly ground, and enclosed in a boron nitride container, which was placed inside a pyrophyllite cube with a graphite heater. All procedures related to the sample preparation were performed in an argon-filled glove box. In a typical run, a pressure of 2 GPa was applied at room temperature. While keeping the pressure constant, the temperature was ramped up in 2 h to the maximum value of 1050 ^{\circ}C, maintained for 20-40 h, and then decreased to room temperature in 1 h. Afterward, the pressure was released, and the sample was removed. All high-pressure prepared samples demonstrate large diamagnetic response with the superconducting transition temperature of \simeq8.4 K (see the inset in Fig. 1). The powder x-ray diffraction patterns are consistent with those reported in Ref. [6].

Measurements of the upper critical field B_{c2} were performed using a Quantum Design 7 T SQUID magnetometer. The temperature dependence of B_{c2} was obtained from field-cooled magnetization curves [M_{\text{FC}}(T)] measured in constant magnetic fields ranging from 0.3 mT to 4 T (see Fig. 1 and Sec. S1 in the Supplemental Material [8]). The B_{c2}(T) curve exhibits a pronounced upward curvature around \sim6-6.5 K. Linear fits of B_{c2}(T) in the vicinity of T_{c} and for T\leqslant 6 K yield B_{c2}/dT=-0.49 and -0.77 T/K, respectively. Open circles correspond to B_{c2}(T) data points from Ref. [6]. They are in perfect agreement with our data thus implying that the upturn on B_{c2}(T) reported here is indeed a generic property of the SrPt_{3}P compound. Note that an upward curvature of B_{c2}(T) was also observed previously for a number of materials such as Nb [12,13], V [12], NbSe_{2}[14,15,16], MgB_{2}[17,18,19], borocarbides and nitrides [20,21,22], heavy fermion systems [23], and various iron-based [24; 25; 26] and cuprate superconductors [27; 28], and was often associated with two-band superconductivity.

The temperature and the magnetic field dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda were obtained from transverse-field (TF) \muSR data [29]. The experiments were carried out at the \pi_E_1 beam line at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The data were analyzed using the free software package musrfit[30]. In a polycrystalline sample the magnetic penetration depth \lambda can be extracted from the Gaussian muon-spin depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm sc}(T)\sim\lambda^{-2}, which reflects the second moment (\sigma_{\rm sc}^{2}/\gamma_{\mu}^{2}, \gamma_{\mu} is the muon gyromagnetic ratio) of the magnetic field distribution due to the flux-line lattice (FLL) in the mixed state [31; 32; 33]. The TF-\muSR data were analyzed using the asymmetry function

\[A(t) = A_{\rm sc}\exp\big{[}-(\sigma_{\rm sc}^{2}+\sigma_{\rm s}^{2})t ^{2}/2\big{]}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{\rm sc}t+\phi)\] (1) \[+A_{b}\exp\big{(}-\sigma_{b}^{2}t^{2}/2\big{)}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B _{b}t+\phi).\]

The first term of Eq. (1) represents the response of the superconducting part of the sample. Here A_{\rm sc} denotes the initial asymmetry; \sigma_{\rm sc} is the Gaussian relaxation rate due to the FLL; \sigma_{\rm s} is the contribution to the field distribution arising from the nuclear moment and which is found to be temperature independent, in agreement with the ZF results (not shown); B_{\rm int} is the internal magnetic field sensed by the muons and \phi is the initial phase of the muon-spin ensemble. The second term with the initial asymmetry A_{b}, small \sigma_{b}<0.3\mus^{-1} and B_{b} close to the applied field corresponds to the background muons stopping in the cryostat and in nonsuperconducting parts of the sample.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of \sigma_{\rm sc} at T=1.7 K as a function of the applied magnetic field B. Each data point was obtained after cooling the sample in the corresponding field from above T_{c} to 1.7 K. The overall decrease of \sigma_{\rm sc} with increasing applied field is partially caused by the decreased width of the internal field distribution upon approaching B_{c2}. To quantify such an effect, one can make use of the numerical Ginzburg-Landau model, developed by Brandt [34]. This model predicts the magnetic field dependence of the second moment of the magnetic field distribution, i.e., the \muSR depolarization rate:

\[\sigma_{\rm sc}\ [\mus^{-1}] = 4.83\times 10^{4}(1-B/B_{c2})\] (2) \[\times[1+1.21(1-\sqrt{B/B_{c2}})^{3}]\lambda^{-2}\ [{\rm nm}^{-2}].\]

Under the assumption of field-independent \lambda the dependence of \sigma_{\rm sc} on B was analyzed by using the values of the upper critical field B_{c2} as obtained in magnetization experiments [B_{c2}(1.7) K \simeq 4.5 T, see Fig. 1]. It is clear that the theoretical \sigma(B), which is presented in Fig. 2 by the dashed line, is not in agreement with the data.

The dependence of \sigma_{\rm sc} on B was further analyzed using the two-component model proposed by Serventi _et al._[35]. The model considers the independent contributions of two bands. Each band is characterized by its own coherence length (\xi_{1},\xi_{2}), while the parameter w_{1}=\rho_{x,1}/\rho_{x} accounts for the contribution of the first band into the total superfluid density (see Ref. [35] and Sec. S2 in the Supplemental Material [8]). The results of the fit with \lambda=134(2) nm, w=0.72(2), \xi_{1}=8.6 nm, and \xi_{2}=26 nm are presented in Fig. 2 by the solid red line.

The temperature dependences of \lambda^{-2} for \mu_{0}H=0.05,0.15, 0.3, and 0.45 T were obtained from measured \sigma_{\rm sc}(T)'s (the inset in Fig. 2) and B_{c2}(T) (Fig. 1) using Eq. (2). Figure 3 shows \lambda^{-2}(T) normalized to its value averaged over the temperature range 1.7-3.5 K as a function of T/T_{c}(B). All data curves

The dotted lines are linear fits of B_{c2}(T) in the vicinity of T_{c} and for T\leqslant 6 K. Open circles are B_{c2}(T) data points from Ref. [6]. The inset shows the temperature dependence of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization measured at \mu_{0}H=0.3 mT.

The dashed black line represents \sigma_{\rm sc}(B) as expected within the model of Brandt [34] for \lambda=162(4) nm and B_{c2}=4.5 T obtained in magnetization experiments. The red solid line is the fit by means of the two-component model from Ref. [35] with the parameters \xi_{1}=8.6 nm, \xi_{2}=26 nm, \lambda=134(2) nm, and w=0.72(2); see Sec. S2 in the Supplemental Material [8]. The inset shows the temperature dependence of the depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm sc} caused by the formation of FLL in SrPt_{3}P in fields of 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.45 T.

  merge into the single line. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the field dependence of \lambda^{-2} for T=1.7,4.1, and 6.1 K.

First we will discuss the temperature dependence of \lambda^{-2}. It is seen that below approximately one half of T_{c}, \lambda^{-2} is temperature independent. The solid line in Fig. 3 represents a fit with the weak-coupling BCS model [36]:

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=\frac{\rho_{s}(T)}{\rho_{s}(0)}=1+2 \int_{\Delta(T)}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\right)\frac{E\,dE} {\sqrt{E^{2}-\Delta(T)^{2}}}.\] (3)

Here \lambda^{-2}(0) and \rho_{s}(0) are the zero-temperature values of the magnetic penetration depth and the superfluid density, respectively, and f=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function. The temperature dependence of the gap is approximated by \Delta(T)/\Delta_{0}=\tanh[1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T)-1]^{0.51}][37], where \Delta_{0} is the maximum gap value at T=0. The fit results in \Delta_{0}(B)/k_{B}T_{c}(B)=4.28(5), \lambda^{-2}(T)/\lambda^{-2}(1.7-3.5 K)=1.021(6), and T/T_{c}(B)=0.972(3). For T_{c}(B=0)\simeq 8.4 K (see Fig. 1) we get \Delta_{0}(B=0)=1.55(2) meV. Note that this value of the superconducting gap is close to \Delta_{0}=1.85 meV obtained from zero-field specific-heat data by Takayama _et al._[6].

It is noteworthy that there is no need to introduce more than one gap parameter or to consider more complicated gap symmetry in order to satisfactorily describe \lambda^{-2}(T) data. Fits using gap functions containing nodes result in higher \chi^{2} than that obtained for the simple s-wave gap model described above (see Sec. S3a in the Supplemental Material [8]). A fit using the anisotropic s-wave gap function results in \chi^{2} comparable to that of the s-wave model with an almost constant zero-temperature gap value (1.50 \leqslant\Delta_{0}\leqslant 1.60 meV, see Sec. S3a in the Supplemental Material [8]). From the analysis of \lambda^{-2}(T) data alone one could therefore conclude that SrPt_{3}P is a a single-band s-wave superconductor. Note that a similar conclusion was reached by Takayama _et al._[6] based on specific-heat data. In the following we will suggest that this was a premature conclusion obtained without considering the field dependence of \lambda.

As follows from the inset in Fig. 3, the field increase from 0.05 up to 0.45 T leads to the decrease of \lambda^{-2} by almost a factor of 2. In single-band s-wave superconductors, \lambda is _independent_ of the magnetic field [32, 37, 38, 39]. A dependence of \lambda on B is expected for superconductors containing nodes in the energy gap or/and multiband superconductors [33, 38, 40, 41, 42]. In the latter case the superfluid density within one series of bands is expected to be suppressed faster by the magnetic field than within the others [41, 42].

The single s-wave gap behavior of \lambda^{-2}(T) (see Fig. 3 and the discussion above) and the multiband features following after the upper critical field B_{\xi 2} and \lambda^{-2}(B) measurements (Figs. 1 and 2 and the inset in Fig. 3) reveal that SrPt_{3}P is a _two-band_ superconductor with energy gaps being _equal_ within both bands [43]. Within a two-band model the deviation from the simple field independence of \lambda as well as the appearance of the upward curvature of the upper critical field could reflect the occurrence of two distinct coherence lengths \xi_{1} and \xi_{2} for two bands (associated with the corresponding upper critical field values B_{\xi 2,i}=\phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi_{i}^{2}) [35, 41, 42, 44, 45, 46]. Following BCS, the zero-temperature coherence length obeys the relation \xi\propto(v_{F})/\Delta_{0} (where v_{F}) is the averaged value of the Fermi velocity). One could assume, therefore, that in SrPt_{3}P the difference between \xi_{1} and \xi_{2} is caused by the different Fermi velocities ((v_{F,1})\neq(v_{F,2})), while the gaps remain the same (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}).

The statement about different (v_{F})'s in two Fermi surface sheets of SrPt_{3}P is fully confirmed by the calculated band structure [7, 9, 10, 11]. According to Refs. [7, 9, 10, 11] there are two bands crossing the Fermi level having significantly different v_{F}'s. The ratio of v_{F}'s is, e.g., \simeq2 along \Gamma-X and \sim3-4 along \Gamma-Z directions of the Brillouin zone. It is worth noting that different Fermi velocities on the different bands are expected to be a general feature of multiband superconductors as, e.g., MgB_{2}[47, 48, 49], borocarbides [21, 49], Fe-based superconductors [50, 51], etc.

Note that the SrPt_{3}P studied here is distinctly different from the "textbook" two-band superconductor MgB_{2} in a particular way. In SrPt_{3}P the charge carriers in both bands are expected to be almost equally strongly coupled to the phonons. Indeed, according to the band structure calculations of Nekrasov _et al._[10] the carriers in two bands correspond to the relatively _similar_pd\pi antibonding states of Pt(I)-P and Pt(II)-P ions, and are coupled to the _same_ low-lying phonon modes confined to the _ab_ plane. In contrast, in MgB_{2} only the \sigma band carriers are coupled strongly to E_{Eg} phonons, while the coupling of both, the \sigma and the \pi, bands to the harmonic B_{1g}, A_{2u}, and E_{1u} phonons is negligible [52]. Therefore, MgB_{2} and SrPt_{3}P correspond to two limiting cases of two-band superconductivity with the energy gaps being nonequal (\Delta_{1}\neq\Delta_{2}, as in MgB_{2}) and equal (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}, as in SrPt_{3}P). At the same time SrPt_{3}P remains the "true" two-band superconductor since, due to nonequal Fermi velocities (\langle v_{F,i}\rangle\neq\langle v_{F,2}\rangle), the carriers in various bands "respond" differently to the magnetic field [as shown here based on B_{\xi 2}(T) and \lambda(B) studies and by Takayama _et al._[6] based on the temperature dependence of the Hall resistivity].

Figure 3: (Color online) \lambda^{-2}(T) normalized to its value averaged over the temperature range 1.7–3.5 K as a function of T/T_{c}(B). The solid line is the fit obtained by using the weak-coupling BCS model [see Eq. (3)]. The inset shows the dependence of \lambda^{-2} on the applied field at T=1.7, 4.1, and 6.1 K.

  By following the above presented arguments we propose a schematic diagram describing relations between the single-, two-, and multiband superconductivities (see Fig. 4). The single-band superconductor has essentially one gap value and one average Fermi velocity (\langle v_{F}\rangle). There are two types of two-band superconductors with energy gaps being equal (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}) or nonequal (\Delta_{1}\neq\Delta_{2}). Both of these types are characterized, however, by nonequal \langle v_{F}\rangle's. The way to multiband superconductors may proceed by different routes. (i) All gaps in all bands crossing the Fermi level are equal (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}\ldots=\Delta_{n}). This is might be the case for the optimally doped LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} having five Fermi surfaces (as most other Fe-based superconductors, see, e.g., Ref. [1] and references therein). As shown by Luetkens _et al._[53] the temperature evolution of the superfluid density of LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} is well described within the single s-wave gap approach, while \lambda^{-2} depends strongly on the magnetic field. It should be noted, however, that the presence of two distinct gaps in LaFeAsO_{0.9}F_{0.1} was reported by Gonnelli _et al._[54] based on the result of point contact Andreev reflection experiment. (ii) Gaps in some Fermi sheets are equal but in others are not (\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}\cdots=\Delta_{k}\neq\Delta_{k+1}\cdots\neq\Delta_{n}). A good example is the optimally doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} where three gaps are equal (\simeq9 meV) while the last gap was found to be approximately eight times smaller (\simeq1.1 meV) [55, 55]. (iii) Gaps in all the Fermi sheets are different (\Delta_{1}\neq\Delta_{2}\cdots\neq\Delta_{n}).

To summarize, the temperature and the magnetic field dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda in the SrPt_{3}P superconductor (T_{c}\simeq 8.4 K) were studied by means of muon-spin rotation. Below T\simeq T_{c}/2 the superfluid density \rho_{i}\propto\lambda^{-2} is temperature independent which is consistent with a fully gapped superconducting state. The full \rho_{s}(T) is well described within the single s-wave gap scenario with the zero-temperature gap value \Delta_{0}=1.55(2) meV. However, \lambda was found to be strongly field dependent well below the upper critical field B_{c2}. This puzzle is reconciled by invoking a two-component model analysis with different characteristic length scales \xi_{1} and \xi_{2}. To conclude, our results suggests that SrPt_{3}P is a representative of a new class of multiband superconductors.
