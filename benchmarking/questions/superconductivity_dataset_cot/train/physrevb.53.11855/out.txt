###### Abstract

The pressure effects on the superconducting transition temperature (dT_{c}/dP) have been systematically measured for a series of (Yb1-Prx)Ba2Cu3O7-_δ_ with x ranging from 0 to 0.3. It has been found that dT_{c}/dP<0 for x = 0, 0.2, and 0.3, and dT_{c}/dP>0 for x = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.15. We have unexpectedly observed a pressure-induced increase in the normal state resistivity for x = 0.2 and 0.3, suggesting a decrease of the carrier concentration under pressure. Making use of the concept of pressure-induced charge transfer incorporated in the model of hole depletion by Pr doping, we have proposed a phenomenological model, which has successfully explained the x dependences of dT_{c}/dP and T_{c}.

## I Introduction

After the discoveries that _R_Ba2Cu3O7 (_R_-123) with1R = Y or rare earth element2 are all 90 K superconductors except R = Pr, Ce, and Tb, many studies have been made to find why Pr is different from other rare earth in this system. As a collective effort on probing the mechanism of nonsuperconductivity in Pr-123,3 it becomes clear that the hybridization of Pr 4f and O 2p orbits plays an essential role. However, the nature of this hybridization effect on the superconductivity is still not clear. In order to understand this nature, the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} on Pr doping in (Y1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 has been extensively studied.4-8 The models for explaining this T_{c}-_x_ relation include hole filling,5 pair breaking,5 hole localization,7 and percolation.8 Among them, the model of hole filling is directly related to the number of carriers (_n_) which is known to be a key parameter determining T_{c}. The results of the Hall measurement9 and the Ca-doping experiment5 on (Y1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 showed that the presence of Pr was accompanied by a decrease of n, in consistence with the model of hole filling. On the other hand, many measurements7,10,11 showed that the valence of the Pr is +3 and it was thus argued that a Pr ion could not possibly provide an electron to fill the hole in the CuO2 plane. In a model of Fehrenbacher and Rice (FR),12 it was suggested that the hole localizes at the Pr site and the extra valence in addition to +3 for the Pr ion may not be detectable by some optical measurements. This model resolves the controversy on the different valence values of the Pr ion obtained from different measurements. But, it still cannot explain the R dependence of T_{c} suppression in (_R_1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7,13 Liechtenstein and Mazin (LM),14 therefore, have modified the work of FR, and proposed that the L orbit in Pr-123 forms a hole-depleting band, which crosses the Fermi level and grabs holes from the CuO pd\,\sigma band. On doping Y (or other _R_) in Pr-123, the position of this hole-depleting band shifts with R, resulting in the R dependence of T_{c} suppression.

According to the work15 on the electronic structure of Gd-123 and Nd-123, the substitution of Gd with Nd reduces the energy difference between 4f and conduction electrons, and, hence, strengthens the hybridization effect of 4f and conduction electrons. Our previous high-pressure study16 on _R_-123 has further revealed that the R substitution induces a charge redistribution giving rise to a T_{c} variation in the series of _R_-123. We have therefore decided to investigate the combined effort of chemical pressure (_R_-size effect) and physical pressure for (_R_1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7, hoping to shed some light on the mechanism of the nonsuperconductivity in Pr-123.

It has been demonstrated that high pressure can influence T_{c} greatly.17 According to the proposed model of pressure-induced charge transfer (PICT), there are two contributions to the pressure effect of T_{c} (_dT_c/_dP_). One is the pressure effect on the maximum T_{c} and the other is the pressure effect on the carrier concentration. In addition, it was further suggested17 that dT_{c}/dP is positive for an underdoped sample (when the carrier concentration of the sample is lower than the optimal value), and negative for an overdoped sample (when the carrier concentration of the sample is higher than the optimal value). However, the pressure work of (Y1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 (Ref. 18) and (Dy1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 (Refs. 19 and 20) have shown that dT_{c}/dP is negative for the samples with x>0.3, which require a modification of the PICT model since the samples are not overdoped but with a negative dT_{c}/dP.

In this work, we have applied physical pressure on a series of (Yb1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 to measure the pressure dependence of T_{c} depression at various Pr-doping levels (_x_). The reason for choosing Yb system is that the ionic radius of Yb is the second smallest while that of Pr is the largest in the rare-earth series. The larger difference in their ionic sizes gives rise to a plateau on the T_{c}-x curve in (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7 at small x.[6] The origin of this plateau for (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7 will also be explained in this paper. Our experimental data have shown that pressure enhances T_{c} for samples with low x (0<x<0.2) but suppresses T_{c} for those with higher x (x = 0.2 and 0.3). These results will be discussed based on a modified model of PICT with a concept of pressure-enhanced hole depletion.

## III. Experiments

Polycrystalline (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7-\delta with x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 were prepared by the standard solid-state reaction technique. All samples were post annealed in flowing oxygen at 400 degC for 8 h. The oxygen contents of these samples were determined to be 6.97 \pm 0.03 by using the idometric titration method. Structural characterization was carried out by using a Rigaku DMAX/BIII powder diffractometer to confirm the phase purity of the samples, and the dc magnetization at field cooling was measured to check their homogeneity. The sample was individually sealed in a Teflon cell with 3M Florinert fluid as a pressure medium and the cell was contained in a Be-Cu high pressure clamp[21] to generate hydrostatic pressure, P, up to 1.8 GPa. The four-point method was employed for resistivity measurements by using the standard inductance bridge. T_{c} was defined as the temperature at which the electrical resistivity drops to 50% of its extrapolated normal-state value. And, the transition width (\Delta T_{c}) was defined as the temperature difference between 90% and 10% of the extrapolated normal-state resistivity values. It was found previously that the pressure effect of T_{c} depends critically on the sample quality, and the data are reliable only when the transitions are sharp. In this work, \Delta T_{c} is less than 1.5 K for x \approx 0.2, and 3.2 K for x = 0.3.

## III III. Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows our data of T_{c} vs x for (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7. The vertical bar represents the transition widths. For x \approx0.2, the transition widths are less than or equal to the size of the solid circles. T_{c} shows a nonlinear and nonmonotonous behavior for samples for x < 0.2; while it increases slightly with x from 0 to \sim0.05, it, however, decreases from \sim0.05 to 0.3. This T_{c}-x relation is consistent with the previous results of Xu and Guan.[22, 23]

T_{c} vs P for several (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7 samples are shown in Fig. 2. T_{c} increases linearly with increasing pressure for x = 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1, but decreases linearly for x = 0, 2, and 0.3. Within our experimental accuracy, the crossover from a positive to a negative slope takes place at x = 0.15, at which T_{c} is nearly constant with pressure up to

  1.8 GPa. According to the least-square fit (see solid lines in Fig. 2), the slope of T_{c} vs P for x\!=\!0 is negative, then becomes positive and increases with increasing x until x reaches 0.075. From x\!=\!0.075 to 0.10 the slope is still positive but decreases with increasing x, and finally becomes negative at x\!=\!0.2 and 0.3. Similar results have been obtained for (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [18]) and (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[19] but, in these cases, the values of dT_{c}/dP become negative at higher values of x.

In Fig. 3, we have plotted dT_{c}/dP for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} as a function of x, and, for comparison, we have included the data for (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[19] From these two sets of data, we have noticed three interesting features. First, for undoped samples (x\!=\!0), dT_{c}/dP is positive for Dy_{1-23} but negative for Yb-123. Second, the nonlinear behavior of dT_{c}/dP vs x for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is similar to that for (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Thirdly, the value of dT_{c}/dP becomes negative at large x for both systems. The opposite sign of dT_{c}/dP for Yb and Dy-123 has been explained in Ref. [14] by the nature of doping: overdoped for Yb-123 and underdoped for Dy-123, arising from the charge redistribution between the charge reservoir and the CuO_{2} plane. For the second and the third features in Fig. 3, the similarity in these two dT_{c}/dP vs x curves suggests that there is a common mechanism, closely related to the mechanism of T_{c} depression by Pr doping, governs the pressure effect on T_{c} in (R_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

The nonlinear behavior of the T_{c}-x relation for small x (see Fig. 1) has also been observed in some small-R systems such as (Er_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (or (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, and has been attributed to a nonmagnetic-magnetic transition by Xu and Guan.[22] This model assumed that there was a region where the 4f electrons of Pr are heavily hybridized with the conduction band such that Pr loses its magnetic moment (as well as the pair-breaking strength), hence, T_{c} is unaffected by Pr doping in this region [the small x region in (R_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with smaller R]. When x crossed the proposed transition, their magnetic moment (and the related pair-breaking strength) recovered and T_{c} was suppressed linearly with Pr doping. This model can be tested in the present pressure study because the magnetic interaction is sensitive to the interatomic distance, as demonstrated in some previous reports on the conventional superconductors.[24] According to the model of Xu and Guan,[22] the change in the slope of T_{c}-x curve at x\!=\!0.15 for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} should be regarded as a transition from nonmagnetic to magnetic state. In the case of (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, T_{c}-x curve, is, however, linear at x\!=\!0.15, and, hence, based on this model, the magnetic transition does not occur. Therefore, one should expect the dT_{c}/dP-x curve in (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} to be very different from that of (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Our dT_{c}/dP-x data, nonetheless, show a similar behavior for these two systems (see Fig. 3), suggesting that the model of Xu and Guan[22] is inadequate to explain these pressure data. To further confirm the absence of this nonmagnetic-to-magnetic transition in (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, we have also measured the magnetic moment of the Pr ion for (Y_{0.98}Pr_{0.02})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. Pr ion is expected to have zero magnetic moment if it is in the nonmagnetic region. A magnetic moment of 2.5 \mu_{B} has been, however, obtained, which is in agreement with the values obtained for various (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by other groups.[6, 25] Our data implies that the model of the absence of the magnetic moment in Pr at small x is not likely to be the mechanism governing the observed plateau in the T_{c}-x relation for (R_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with smaller R.

A hole-filling/pair-breaking model has been proposed to interpret the x dependence of T_{c} and dT_{c}/dP in the (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} system by Maple _et al.[18]_ In this model, the behavior of T_{c}-x at ambient pressure is interpreted as the outcome of the competition between a parabolic carrier-density term and a linear pair-breaking effect:

\[T_{c}\!=\!T_{c0}\!-\!A(\alpha\!-\!\beta x)^{2}\!-\!Bx,\] (1)

where A is a constant, B the pair-breaking parameter, and (\alpha\!-\!\beta x) the number of effective carriers and it was assumed that only T_{c0}, \beta, and B changed with pressure. Then,

\[dT_{c}/dP =\!dT_{c0}/dP+(2\,\Lambda\,\alpha d\beta/dP-dB/dP)x\] \[-(2\,\Lambda\,\beta d\beta/dP)x^{2}.\] (2)

However, it has been shown in Ref. [18] that owing to the large uncertainty on dB/dP, Eq. (2) could not be used to provide information on the pressure dependence of the magnetic interaction. In other words, although Eq. (1) describes the T_{c}-x relation of (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} rather well, Eq. (2), which is derived from Eq. (1), cannot satisfactorily explain the experimental data of dT_{c}/dP vs x.

In Fig. 3, our data show that dT_{c}/dP is negative for x\!=\!0, 0.2, and 0.3. For x\!=\!0 (pure Yb-123), negative dT_{c}/dP can be understood because it is in the overdoped state, in which an increase in n by pressure causes T_{c} decrease as seen in the previous report for (Y,La,Ca)-123.[17] The negative dT_{c}/dP values for x\!=\!0.2 and 0.3 are somehow unusual, since these two samples have low T_{c} and are not overdoped. According to the fitting for the pressure data of (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by using Eq. (2),[18]dB/dP is positive and dB/dP is negative, indicating that the negative dT_{c}/dP results from the quadratic term of x. In other words, the major contribution to the negative dT_{c}/dP is the increase of \beta with P (note: the increase in \beta means the decrease in the hole concentration). This observation is in accord with our results of the pressure dependence of the resistivity behavior. We have found that the normal state resistivity decreases under pressure for x\!<\!0.2, but increases under pressure for x\!=\!0.2 and 0.3. Figures 4 and 5 display the temperature dependence for resistivity \rho under various pressures for x\!=\!0 and 0.3, respectively. Figure 4 shows a decrease of the normal state \rho and a decrease in T_{c} under pressure, while in Fig. 5, the normal state \rho increases with a decrease in T_{c} under pressure. The value of d ln\rho/dP has been obtained to be -\!10\!\pm\!2\%/GPa for samples with x\!<\!0.15, which is consistent with those of high temperature superconductors (HTS). This value of d ln\rho/dP found in most HTS has been attributed to the pressure-induced charge transfer from the charge reservoir to the CuO_{2} plane.[28] Therefore,  stood in terms of a decrease in n induced by pressure. However, for samples with large x, the \rho-T behavior may change from metalliclike to insulatinglike, [18, 19, 20] which could be due to a pressure-induced hole localization. [20]

The model of FR (Ref. [12]) has shown that the mixed state of Pr^{+3} and Pr^{+4} plays an essential role in determining the electronic state of the CuO_{2} plane. When the hole state in Pr-O_{3} is more stable than in the Cu-O planar singlet, more holes are bound to Pr sites. More precisely, holes will transfer from the Cu-O pd\sigma band into the FR state which is a mixture of 4f^{1} and 4f^{2}L configurations with L being a ligand hole in the O 2p orbit. In this model, there exist two discrete hole states: n_{p}=0 or n_{p}=(1-n_{c})/2 where n_{p} is the number of holes per CuO_{2} plane and n_{c} the number of holes per CuO chain. Nonetheless, with only two discrete stable solutions for the hole states, this model cannot be used to explain the observed continuous suppression of T_{c} by increasing Pr doping. Therefore, Liechtenstein and Mazin [14] modified the work of FR by assuming an additional dispersive band crossing the Fermi level, which can grab holes from the Cu-O pd\sigma band (namely, the fractional holes can be transferred to the FR state). The result of the calculation in the density of states [14] refers that the number of holes transferred to the FR state is x and R dependent.

Based on the argument of LM, [14] the observed negative dT_{c}/dP accompanied by positive d ln\rho/dP can be explained in terms of the pressure-enhanced hole depletion from the CuO_{2}pd\sigma band, resulting in a pressure-induced T_{c} suppression. However, the positive dT_{c}/dP values for 0<x<0.15 indicate the presence of another pressure effect on T_{c}, which is believed to be the effect of PICT. Consequently, in order to explain our data of T_{c}-x and dT_{c}/dP-x, we have proposed a model based on the theory of LM along with the concept of PICT. The central theme of our model is that the pressure effect on T_{c} arises from two competitive components: one is the PICT from the CuO_{2} chain to the CuO_{2} plane, yielding an increase in n; the other is the pressure-enhanced hole transfer from the CuO_{2} plane to the FR state, giving a decrease in n.

Including the hole-depletion effect of Pr doping in the parabolic function of n, T_{c} can be written as

\[T_{c} = T_{c0}-C(n-n_{0}-Dx)^{2},\] (3)

where C is a constant, n_{0} the optimal n corresponding to the maximum T_{c} (T_{c0}), and D an effective factor related to the hole depletion by each Pr ion. Here, we assume D to be pressure dependent. Then,

\[dT_{c}/dP = dT_{c0}/dP-2C(n-n_{0}-Dx)dn/dP\] (4) \[+2\,Cx(n-n_{0}-Dx)(dD/dP)\] \[= dT_{c0}/dP-2C(n-n_{0}-Dx)\] \[\times(dn/dP-xdD/dP),\]

  in which dn/dP is the rate change of the number of carriers under pressure through charge transfer from the CuO chain to the CuO_{2} plane, and xdD/dP is that from the CuO_{2} plane to the FR state. We have used Eq. (3) to fit our experimental data of T_{c} vs x with T_{c\phi} and D fixed, allowing n_{0}-n and C to vary. T_{c\phi} is chosen to be 89.6 K because it is the maximum T_{c} in the T_{c}-x curve (see Fig. 1), and we have taken D = 0.3 as suggested by LM.[14] As shown in Fig. 6(a), curve I is our best fit for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with C = 3000 and n-n_{0} = 0.015. For comparison, we have included the data and the fitting (curve II) for (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. For curve II, C = 3000, n_{0}-n = 0.022. From Fig. 6(a), we have found that curve II is more linear than curve I, in consistence with the experimental observations for those systems with large R.[6, 22, 23] Inserting the same values of n_{0}-n, C, and D as those used to obtain curves I and II, the data dT_{c}/dP vs x were fitted by using Eq. (4). We have employed dn/dP = 0.0065 hole/GPa following Ref. 27, with dD/dP and dT_{c\phi}/dP to be the adjustable parameters. The physical meaning of dD/dP is the number of the pressure-enhanced hole depletion per Pr ion. Curve III is a fit with dT_{c\phi}/dP = (0.05\pm0.03) K/GPa and dD/dP = (0.037\pm0.007) GPa^{-1} for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}; curve IV is with dT_{c\phi}/dP = (0.8\pm0.1) K/GPa and dD/dP = (0.035\pm0.003) GPa^{-1} for (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. As shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), our fittings agree with the data within the experimental error. The good agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical curves suggests the applicability of our model.

## IV Conclusion

We have systematically measured T_{c} and dT_{c}/dP for the series of (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Our results have shown dT_{c}/dP <0 for x = 0, 0.2, and 0.3 and >0 for x = 0.05 to 0.15. The negative values of dT_{c}/dP for x = 0.2 and 0.3 were accompanied by positive d ln/dP, suggesting a pressure-induced decrease in the carrier concentration. In order to explain our data, we have developed a phenomenological model by incorporating the concept of pressure-induced charge transfer into the model of LM. A good agreement has been obtained between the experimental data and the theoretical curves of T_{c} vs x and dT_{c}/dP vs x for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. For this reason, our model can also be used to predict the R dependence of dT_{c}/dP vs x. Nevertheless, further testing of this model calls for more pressure work on other (R_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

###### Abstract

The pressure effects on the superconducting transition temperature (dT_{c}/dP) have been systematically measured for a series of (Yb1-Prx)Ba2Cu3O7-_δ_ with x ranging from 0 to 0.3. It has been found that dT_{c}/dP<0 for x = 0, 0.2, and 0.3, and dT_{c}/dP>0 for x = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.15. We have unexpectedly observed a pressure-induced increase in the normal state resistivity for x = 0.2 and 0.3, suggesting a decrease of the carrier concentration under pressure. Making use of the concept of pressure-induced charge transfer incorporated in the model of hole depletion by Pr doping, we have proposed a phenomenological model, which has successfully explained the x dependences of dT_{c}/dP and T_{c}.

## I Introduction

After the discoveries that _R_Ba2Cu3O7 (_R_-123) with1R = Y or rare earth element2 are all 90 K superconductors except R = Pr, Ce, and Tb, many studies have been made to find why Pr is different from other rare earth in this system. As a collective effort on probing the mechanism of nonsuperconductivity in Pr-123,3 it becomes clear that the hybridization of Pr 4f and O 2p orbits plays an essential role. However, the nature of this hybridization effect on the superconductivity is still not clear. In order to understand this nature, the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} on Pr doping in (Y1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 has been extensively studied.4-8 The models for explaining this T_{c}-_x_ relation include hole filling,5 pair breaking,5 hole localization,7 and percolation.8 Among them, the model of hole filling is directly related to the number of carriers (_n_) which is known to be a key parameter determining T_{c}. The results of the Hall measurement9 and the Ca-doping experiment5 on (Y1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 showed that the presence of Pr was accompanied by a decrease of n, in consistence with the model of hole filling. On the other hand, many measurements7,10,11 showed that the valence of the Pr is +3 and it was thus argued that a Pr ion could not possibly provide an electron to fill the hole in the CuO2 plane. In a model of Fehrenbacher and Rice (FR),12 it was suggested that the hole localizes at the Pr site and the extra valence in addition to +3 for the Pr ion may not be detectable by some optical measurements. This model resolves the controversy on the different valence values of the Pr ion obtained from different measurements. But, it still cannot explain the R dependence of T_{c} suppression in (_R_1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7,13 Liechtenstein and Mazin (LM),14 therefore, have modified the work of FR, and proposed that the L orbit in Pr-123 forms a hole-depleting band, which crosses the Fermi level and grabs holes from the CuO pd\,\sigma band. On doping Y (or other _R_) in Pr-123, the position of this hole-depleting band shifts with R, resulting in the R dependence of T_{c} suppression.

According to the work15 on the electronic structure of Gd-123 and Nd-123, the substitution of Gd with Nd reduces the energy difference between 4f and conduction electrons, and, hence, strengthens the hybridization effect of 4f and conduction electrons. Our previous high-pressure study16 on _R_-123 has further revealed that the R substitution induces a charge redistribution giving rise to a T_{c} variation in the series of _R_-123. We have therefore decided to investigate the combined effort of chemical pressure (_R_-size effect) and physical pressure for (_R_1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7, hoping to shed some light on the mechanism of the nonsuperconductivity in Pr-123.

It has been demonstrated that high pressure can influence T_{c} greatly.17 According to the proposed model of pressure-induced charge transfer (PICT), there are two contributions to the pressure effect of T_{c} (_dT_c/_dP_). One is the pressure effect on the maximum T_{c} and the other is the pressure effect on the carrier concentration. In addition, it was further suggested17 that dT_{c}/dP is positive for an underdoped sample (when the carrier concentration of the sample is lower than the optimal value), and negative for an overdoped sample (when the carrier concentration of the sample is higher than the optimal value). However, the pressure work of (Y1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 (Ref. 18) and (Dy1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 (Refs. 19 and 20) have shown that dT_{c}/dP is negative for the samples with x>0.3, which require a modification of the PICT model since the samples are not overdoped but with a negative dT_{c}/dP.

In this work, we have applied physical pressure on a series of (Yb1-_x_Prx)Ba2Cu3O7 to measure the pressure dependence of T_{c} depression at various Pr-doping levels (_x_). The reason for choosing Yb system is that the ionic radius of Yb is the second smallest while that of Pr is the largest in the rare-earth series. The larger difference in their ionic sizes gives rise to a plateau on the T_{c}-x curve in (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7 at small x.[6] The origin of this plateau for (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7 will also be explained in this paper. Our experimental data have shown that pressure enhances T_{c} for samples with low x (0<x<0.2) but suppresses T_{c} for those with higher x (x = 0.2 and 0.3). These results will be discussed based on a modified model of PICT with a concept of pressure-enhanced hole depletion.

## III. Experiments

Polycrystalline (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7-\delta with x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.3 were prepared by the standard solid-state reaction technique. All samples were post annealed in flowing oxygen at 400 degC for 8 h. The oxygen contents of these samples were determined to be 6.97 \pm 0.03 by using the idometric titration method. Structural characterization was carried out by using a Rigaku DMAX/BIII powder diffractometer to confirm the phase purity of the samples, and the dc magnetization at field cooling was measured to check their homogeneity. The sample was individually sealed in a Teflon cell with 3M Florinert fluid as a pressure medium and the cell was contained in a Be-Cu high pressure clamp[21] to generate hydrostatic pressure, P, up to 1.8 GPa. The four-point method was employed for resistivity measurements by using the standard inductance bridge. T_{c} was defined as the temperature at which the electrical resistivity drops to 50% of its extrapolated normal-state value. And, the transition width (\Delta T_{c}) was defined as the temperature difference between 90% and 10% of the extrapolated normal-state resistivity values. It was found previously that the pressure effect of T_{c} depends critically on the sample quality, and the data are reliable only when the transitions are sharp. In this work, \Delta T_{c} is less than 1.5 K for x \approx 0.2, and 3.2 K for x = 0.3.

## III III. Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows our data of T_{c} vs x for (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7. The vertical bar represents the transition widths. For x \approx0.2, the transition widths are less than or equal to the size of the solid circles. T_{c} shows a nonlinear and nonmonotonous behavior for samples for x < 0.2; while it increases slightly with x from 0 to \sim0.05, it, however, decreases from \sim0.05 to 0.3. This T_{c}-x relation is consistent with the previous results of Xu and Guan.[22, 23]

T_{c} vs P for several (Yb1-xPr_{x})Ba2Cu3O7 samples are shown in Fig. 2. T_{c} increases linearly with increasing pressure for x = 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1, but decreases linearly for x = 0, 2, and 0.3. Within our experimental accuracy, the crossover from a positive to a negative slope takes place at x = 0.15, at which T_{c} is nearly constant with pressure up to

  1.8 GPa. According to the least-square fit (see solid lines in Fig. 2), the slope of T_{c} vs P for x\!=\!0 is negative, then becomes positive and increases with increasing x until x reaches 0.075. From x\!=\!0.075 to 0.10 the slope is still positive but decreases with increasing x, and finally becomes negative at x\!=\!0.2 and 0.3. Similar results have been obtained for (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (Ref. [18]) and (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[19] but, in these cases, the values of dT_{c}/dP become negative at higher values of x.

In Fig. 3, we have plotted dT_{c}/dP for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} as a function of x, and, for comparison, we have included the data for (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[19] From these two sets of data, we have noticed three interesting features. First, for undoped samples (x\!=\!0), dT_{c}/dP is positive for Dy_{1-23} but negative for Yb-123. Second, the nonlinear behavior of dT_{c}/dP vs x for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is similar to that for (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Thirdly, the value of dT_{c}/dP becomes negative at large x for both systems. The opposite sign of dT_{c}/dP for Yb and Dy-123 has been explained in Ref. [14] by the nature of doping: overdoped for Yb-123 and underdoped for Dy-123, arising from the charge redistribution between the charge reservoir and the CuO_{2} plane. For the second and the third features in Fig. 3, the similarity in these two dT_{c}/dP vs x curves suggests that there is a common mechanism, closely related to the mechanism of T_{c} depression by Pr doping, governs the pressure effect on T_{c} in (R_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.

The nonlinear behavior of the T_{c}-x relation for small x (see Fig. 1) has also been observed in some small-R systems such as (Er_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (or (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, and has been attributed to a nonmagnetic-magnetic transition by Xu and Guan.[22] This model assumed that there was a region where the 4f electrons of Pr are heavily hybridized with the conduction band such that Pr loses its magnetic moment (as well as the pair-breaking strength), hence, T_{c} is unaffected by Pr doping in this region [the small x region in (R_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with smaller R]. When x crossed the proposed transition, their magnetic moment (and the related pair-breaking strength) recovered and T_{c} was suppressed linearly with Pr doping. This model can be tested in the present pressure study because the magnetic interaction is sensitive to the interatomic distance, as demonstrated in some previous reports on the conventional superconductors.[24] According to the model of Xu and Guan,[22] the change in the slope of T_{c}-x curve at x\!=\!0.15 for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} should be regarded as a transition from nonmagnetic to magnetic state. In the case of (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, T_{c}-x curve, is, however, linear at x\!=\!0.15, and, hence, based on this model, the magnetic transition does not occur. Therefore, one should expect the dT_{c}/dP-x curve in (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} to be very different from that of (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Our dT_{c}/dP-x data, nonetheless, show a similar behavior for these two systems (see Fig. 3), suggesting that the model of Xu and Guan[22] is inadequate to explain these pressure data. To further confirm the absence of this nonmagnetic-to-magnetic transition in (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, we have also measured the magnetic moment of the Pr ion for (Y_{0.98}Pr_{0.02})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. Pr ion is expected to have zero magnetic moment if it is in the nonmagnetic region. A magnetic moment of 2.5 \mu_{B} has been, however, obtained, which is in agreement with the values obtained for various (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by other groups.[6, 25] Our data implies that the model of the absence of the magnetic moment in Pr at small x is not likely to be the mechanism governing the observed plateau in the T_{c}-x relation for (R_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with smaller R.

A hole-filling/pair-breaking model has been proposed to interpret the x dependence of T_{c} and dT_{c}/dP in the (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} system by Maple _et al.[18]_ In this model, the behavior of T_{c}-x at ambient pressure is interpreted as the outcome of the competition between a parabolic carrier-density term and a linear pair-breaking effect:

\[T_{c}\!=\!T_{c0}\!-\!A(\alpha\!-\!\beta x)^{2}\!-\!Bx,\] (1)

where A is a constant, B the pair-breaking parameter, and (\alpha\!-\!\beta x) the number of effective carriers and it was assumed that only T_{c0}, \beta, and B changed with pressure. Then,

\[dT_{c}/dP =\!dT_{c0}/dP+(2\,\Lambda\,\alpha d\beta/dP-dB/dP)x\] \[-(2\,\Lambda\,\beta d\beta/dP)x^{2}.\] (2)

However, it has been shown in Ref. [18] that owing to the large uncertainty on dB/dP, Eq. (2) could not be used to provide information on the pressure dependence of the magnetic interaction. In other words, although Eq. (1) describes the T_{c}-x relation of (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} rather well, Eq. (2), which is derived from Eq. (1), cannot satisfactorily explain the experimental data of dT_{c}/dP vs x.

In Fig. 3, our data show that dT_{c}/dP is negative for x\!=\!0, 0.2, and 0.3. For x\!=\!0 (pure Yb-123), negative dT_{c}/dP can be understood because it is in the overdoped state, in which an increase in n by pressure causes T_{c} decrease as seen in the previous report for (Y,La,Ca)-123.[17] The negative dT_{c}/dP values for x\!=\!0.2 and 0.3 are somehow unusual, since these two samples have low T_{c} and are not overdoped. According to the fitting for the pressure data of (Y_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} by using Eq. (2),[18]dB/dP is positive and dB/dP is negative, indicating that the negative dT_{c}/dP results from the quadratic term of x. In other words, the major contribution to the negative dT_{c}/dP is the increase of \beta with P (note: the increase in \beta means the decrease in the hole concentration). This observation is in accord with our results of the pressure dependence of the resistivity behavior. We have found that the normal state resistivity decreases under pressure for x\!<\!0.2, but increases under pressure for x\!=\!0.2 and 0.3. Figures 4 and 5 display the temperature dependence for resistivity \rho under various pressures for x\!=\!0 and 0.3, respectively. Figure 4 shows a decrease of the normal state \rho and a decrease in T_{c} under pressure, while in Fig. 5, the normal state \rho increases with a decrease in T_{c} under pressure. The value of d ln\rho/dP has been obtained to be -\!10\!\pm\!2\%/GPa for samples with x\!<\!0.15, which is consistent with those of high temperature superconductors (HTS). This value of d ln\rho/dP found in most HTS has been attributed to the pressure-induced charge transfer from the charge reservoir to the CuO_{2} plane.[28] Therefore,  stood in terms of a decrease in n induced by pressure. However, for samples with large x, the \rho-T behavior may change from metalliclike to insulatinglike, [18, 19, 20] which could be due to a pressure-induced hole localization. [20]

The model of FR (Ref. [12]) has shown that the mixed state of Pr^{+3} and Pr^{+4} plays an essential role in determining the electronic state of the CuO_{2} plane. When the hole state in Pr-O_{3} is more stable than in the Cu-O planar singlet, more holes are bound to Pr sites. More precisely, holes will transfer from the Cu-O pd\sigma band into the FR state which is a mixture of 4f^{1} and 4f^{2}L configurations with L being a ligand hole in the O 2p orbit. In this model, there exist two discrete hole states: n_{p}=0 or n_{p}=(1-n_{c})/2 where n_{p} is the number of holes per CuO_{2} plane and n_{c} the number of holes per CuO chain. Nonetheless, with only two discrete stable solutions for the hole states, this model cannot be used to explain the observed continuous suppression of T_{c} by increasing Pr doping. Therefore, Liechtenstein and Mazin [14] modified the work of FR by assuming an additional dispersive band crossing the Fermi level, which can grab holes from the Cu-O pd\sigma band (namely, the fractional holes can be transferred to the FR state). The result of the calculation in the density of states [14] refers that the number of holes transferred to the FR state is x and R dependent.

Based on the argument of LM, [14] the observed negative dT_{c}/dP accompanied by positive d ln\rho/dP can be explained in terms of the pressure-enhanced hole depletion from the CuO_{2}pd\sigma band, resulting in a pressure-induced T_{c} suppression. However, the positive dT_{c}/dP values for 0<x<0.15 indicate the presence of another pressure effect on T_{c}, which is believed to be the effect of PICT. Consequently, in order to explain our data of T_{c}-x and dT_{c}/dP-x, we have proposed a model based on the theory of LM along with the concept of PICT. The central theme of our model is that the pressure effect on T_{c} arises from two competitive components: one is the PICT from the CuO_{2} chain to the CuO_{2} plane, yielding an increase in n; the other is the pressure-enhanced hole transfer from the CuO_{2} plane to the FR state, giving a decrease in n.

Including the hole-depletion effect of Pr doping in the parabolic function of n, T_{c} can be written as

\[T_{c} = T_{c0}-C(n-n_{0}-Dx)^{2},\] (3)

where C is a constant, n_{0} the optimal n corresponding to the maximum T_{c} (T_{c0}), and D an effective factor related to the hole depletion by each Pr ion. Here, we assume D to be pressure dependent. Then,

\[dT_{c}/dP = dT_{c0}/dP-2C(n-n_{0}-Dx)dn/dP\] (4) \[+2\,Cx(n-n_{0}-Dx)(dD/dP)\] \[= dT_{c0}/dP-2C(n-n_{0}-Dx)\] \[\times(dn/dP-xdD/dP),\]

  in which dn/dP is the rate change of the number of carriers under pressure through charge transfer from the CuO chain to the CuO_{2} plane, and xdD/dP is that from the CuO_{2} plane to the FR state. We have used Eq. (3) to fit our experimental data of T_{c} vs x with T_{c\phi} and D fixed, allowing n_{0}-n and C to vary. T_{c\phi} is chosen to be 89.6 K because it is the maximum T_{c} in the T_{c}-x curve (see Fig. 1), and we have taken D = 0.3 as suggested by LM.[14] As shown in Fig. 6(a), curve I is our best fit for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} with C = 3000 and n-n_{0} = 0.015. For comparison, we have included the data and the fitting (curve II) for (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. For curve II, C = 3000, n_{0}-n = 0.022. From Fig. 6(a), we have found that curve II is more linear than curve I, in consistence with the experimental observations for those systems with large R.[6, 22, 23] Inserting the same values of n_{0}-n, C, and D as those used to obtain curves I and II, the data dT_{c}/dP vs x were fitted by using Eq. (4). We have employed dn/dP = 0.0065 hole/GPa following Ref. 27, with dD/dP and dT_{c\phi}/dP to be the adjustable parameters. The physical meaning of dD/dP is the number of the pressure-enhanced hole depletion per Pr ion. Curve III is a fit with dT_{c\phi}/dP = (0.05\pm0.03) K/GPa and dD/dP = (0.037\pm0.007) GPa^{-1} for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}; curve IV is with dT_{c\phi}/dP = (0.8\pm0.1) K/GPa and dD/dP = (0.035\pm0.003) GPa^{-1} for (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. As shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), our fittings agree with the data within the experimental error. The good agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical curves suggests the applicability of our model.

## IV Conclusion

We have systematically measured T_{c} and dT_{c}/dP for the series of (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. Our results have shown dT_{c}/dP <0 for x = 0, 0.2, and 0.3 and >0 for x = 0.05 to 0.15. The negative values of dT_{c}/dP for x = 0.2 and 0.3 were accompanied by positive d ln/dP, suggesting a pressure-induced decrease in the carrier concentration. In order to explain our data, we have developed a phenomenological model by incorporating the concept of pressure-induced charge transfer into the model of LM. A good agreement has been obtained between the experimental data and the theoretical curves of T_{c} vs x and dT_{c}/dP vs x for (Yb_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} and (Dy_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. For this reason, our model can also be used to predict the R dependence of dT_{c}/dP vs x. Nevertheless, further testing of this model calls for more pressure work on other (R_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.
