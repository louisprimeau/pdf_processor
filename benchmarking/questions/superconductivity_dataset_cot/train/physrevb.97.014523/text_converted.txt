###### Abstract

The transition metal dichalcogenide PdTe₂ was recently shown to be a
unique system where a type-II Dirac semimetallic phase and a
superconducting phase coexist. This observation has led to wide
speculation on the possibility of the emergence of an unconventional
topological superconducting phase in PdTe₂. Here, through direct
measurement of the superconducting energy gap by scanning tunneling
spectroscopy, and temperature and magnetic-field evolution of same, we
show that the superconducting phase in PdTe₂ is conventional in nature.
The superconducting energy gap is measured to be 326 μeV at 0.38 K, and
it follows a temperature dependence that is well described within the
framework of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer’s theory of conventional
superconductivity. This is surprising because our quantum oscillation
measurements confirm that at least one of the bands participating in
transport has topologically nontrivial character.

It is believed that a superconducting ground state realized on a
material displaying topologically nontrivial character might lead to the
discovery of the elusive phase of matter called topological
superconductivity [1, 2, 3] where relativistic Majorana fermions could
emerge as excitations [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In the past, attempts were
made to realize such a phase of matter through a number of ways, such as
doping a topological insulator [11, 12, 13], applying pressure on
topological systems [14], fabricating proximity-coupled heterostructures
of topological insulators and conventional superconductors [10, 15],
making mesoscopically confined point contacts on a topological
crystalline insulator [16], Dirac [17, 18] or Weyl semimetals [19], etc.
In such systems, while a superconducting phase could be achieved, clear
manifestation of topological superconductivity remained an unattained
goal. Most recently, with the discovery of a type-II Dirac semimetallic
phase on the dichalcogenide PdTe₂[20, 21, 22], where a superconducting
phase is known to emerge naturally [23, 24], there has been wide
speculation that this superconducting phase might eventually emerge as a
topological superconductor. Owing to the existence of a topological
phase along with superconductivity, it warrants a thorough investigation
of the superconducting phase of PdTe₂ through high-resolution
spectroscopic tools.

In this paper, we report scanning-tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
results performed on high-quality single crystals of PdTe₂ in ultrahigh
vacuum (UHV) and subkelvin temperatures to spectroscopically probe the
nature of superconductivity. Through systematic temperature and
magnetic-field-dependent experiments, we found that the superconducting
phase in PdTe₂, despite its proximity to a topologically nontrivial
Dirac semimetallic phase, is conventional in nature where the
superconducting order parameter shows a temperature dependence
consistent with the prediction of the theory of Bardeen, Cooper, and
Schrieffer (BCS) for conventional superconductors [25].

High-quality single crystals of PdTe₂ were grown by a melt-growth
method. The starting elements, Pd (99.99

The high quality of the crystals was confirmed by a high residual
resistivity ratio ρ_(300K)/ρ_(2K) ∼ 75 [see inset of Fig. 1(a)]. This is
significantly higher than the ratio (∼10) reported for the PdTe₂
crystals used in the past [26]. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1(a), the
crystals also exhibited de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations
at a relatively low magnetic field of 3 T [21, 27] with the magnetic
field applied perpendicular to the c axis of the crystal. In Fig. 1(b),
we show the Landau level index (n) plot constructed from the quantum
oscillation data. The plot was fitted well by a straight line, the
extrapolation to 1/B ∼ 0 of which gave a nonzero intercept of 0.42. This
indicates that the only band [see the fast Fourier transform (FFT) plot
in the inset of Fig. 1(b)] giving rise to the oscillations for B ⊥ c
axis is topologically nontrivial. It should be noted that since we could
record signals only for high values of the Landau level indices, the
error in the calculation of the intercept could be relatively high
thereby, making the determination of the exact Berry phase difficult. An
analysis of the temperature dependence of oscillation amplitude with
Lifshitz-Kosevich fitting revealed an effective mass of 0.27μn₀ for the
given band, where m₀ is the free-electron mass. Frequencies
corresponding to other bands were observed when the magnetic field was
applied parallel to the c axis of the crystal [see Fig. 1(c)]. The high
quality of the crystals is further confirmed by a sharp anomaly in heat
capacity at the superconducting transition [inset of Fig. 1(a)].

The scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunnelling
spectroscopy (STS) experiments were carried out in an UHV cryostat
working down to 300 mK (Unisoku system with RHK R9 controller). First, a
single crystal of PdTe₂ was mounted in a low-temperature cleaving stage
where the crystal was cleaved by an _in situ_ cleaver at 77 K in UHV
(10⁻¹¹ mbar). Subsequently, the crystal was transferred by an UHV
manipulator to the scanning stage at low temperature. This process
minimized the possibility of contamination and/or modification of the
pristine surface. In Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), we show atomic resolution
images of the PdTe₂ surface captured at 385 mK. The surface shows a
triangular or hexagonal closed pack (hcp) arrangement of the atoms with
an interatomic distance of 4.0 ± 0.1 A, which matches well with the
previously reported measurements [28]. The inset of Fig. 2(b) depicts
the topographic modulation corresponding to the line cut in Fig. 2(b).
As indicated by white and yellow arrows in Fig. 2(a), two kinds of
defects are also visible in the images–one of them being of so-called
clover-leaf-shaped defects (shown by white

arrow) that are ubiquitously seen on the surfaces of topological
insulators like Bi₂Se₃, Bi₂Te₅, etc [29, 30]. It should be noted that in
earlier STM works on PdTe₂, the defect states were not resolved [28].
Such defects are known to be associated with the adatoms and vacancies
on the surface. In PdTe₂, the clover-leaf shaped defects could be due to
Te vacancies in the crystals. In topological insulators, the
concentration of defects determines the position of the surface Dirac
cone in a given crystal with respect to the Fermi energy. The
$\frac{dI}{dV}$ vs V spectra on PdTe₂ recorded at 22 K reveal a
"V"-shaped feature which might correspond to a Dirac cone and that is
seen to appear 110 meV below the Fermi energy. These observations are
consistent with the reported type-II Dirac semimetallic nature of
PdTe₂[21].

After confirming the pristine nature of the surface through atomic
resolution imaging, we performed local tunneling spectroscopy at several
points on the surface using the STM tip. At lowest temperature, the
$\frac{dI}{dV}$ vs V spectrum shows two clear peaks at ±326 μV symmetric
about V = 0, below which $\frac{dI}{dV}\sim 0$ [see Fig. 2(d)]. These
are the coherence peaks due to the superconducting phase of PdTe₂, and
the peak position provides a direct measure of the superconducting
energy gap (Δ). To obtain a quantitative estimate of Δ, we fitted the
spectrum with the tunneling equation
$\frac{dI}{dV}=\frac{d}{dV}(G_{N}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}N_{s}(E)N_{n}(E-eV)[f( E)-f(E-eV)]d\,E)$,
where $G_{N}=\frac{dI}{dV}|_{V\gg\Delta/e}$, N_(s)(E) and N_(n)(E) are
the normalized density of states of the BCS-like superconducting sample
and the normal metallic tip, respectively, while f(E) is the Fermi-Dirac
distribution function [31]. Since the relevant energy scale in this case
is small (∼few hundreds of μ V), it is reasonable to assume N_(n)(E) to
be independent of E. As per Dyne’s formula
$N_{s}(E)=Re(\frac{(E-I\Gamma)}{\sqrt{(E-I\Gamma)^{3}-\Delta^{2}}})$,
where Γ is an effective broadening parameter included to take care of
slight broadening of the BCS density of states, possibly due to finite
lifetime of quasiparticles [32]. In our analysis, Γ remained very small,
within 1

To further investigate the superconductivity in PdTe₂, we carried out
detailed temperature (T) dependence of the dI/dV spectra. Figure 3(a)
shows that, with increasing temperature, the spectral features undergo
broadening as expected. The position of the coherence peaks do not show
noticeable change with increasing T at low temperatures, indicating the
gap (Δ) to be nearly constant at low temperature. As shown by the solid
line in Fig. 3(a), Δ decreases smoothly to zero following
$\Delta(T)\sim(1-\frac{T}{T_{c}})^{1/2}$ near T_(c) ∼ 1.78 K [26], as
expected for a conventional BCS superconductor [25]. The critical
temperature thus measured is consistent with the value measured by a
temperature-dependent heat capacity measurement on the same crystal
[inset of Fig. 1(a)].

We have also investigated the behavior of the superconducting phase as a
function of increasing magnetic field (H) [Fig. 3(b)]. The magnetic
field was applied along the c axis of the crystal. The coherence peaks
closed smoothly with increasing H and all the spectral features
disappeared at a high critical field H_(c) of 1.6 T at 385 mK [see Fig.
3(b)]. This corresponds to a coherence length of 14 nm. We have carried
out temperature dependence of the spectra for different H and
constructed the H−T phase diagram as presented in Fig. 3(a), inset. The
phase diagram shows a concave curvature with no visible tail near T_(c)
and matches well with the empirically expected behavior for a
conventional superconductor. The solid line in the Fig. 3(a) inset
represents the empirically expected phase line for a conventional
superconductor where $H_{c}=H_{0}[1-(\frac{T}{c})^{2}]$. The remarkable
match of the experimental data with the theoretical line provides
further support for the conventional nature of superconductivity in
PdTe₂. This is surprising provided the existence of a topologically
nontrivial band taking part in transport. The emergence of such a
conventional superconducting phase might be due to electron pairing
taking place in another band. This possibility cannot be ruled out since
our dHvA oscillation measurements with H||c axis show that there are
other bands available which could be trivial and could lead to
superconductivity. Thus, from our measurements, it is clear that despite
the presence of at least one band with topologically nontrivial
character, PdTe2 displays conventional superconductivity.

The critical field showed inhomogeneity from point to point on the
cleaved PdTe₂ surface and it was possible to measure superconductivity
up to 4 T at certain points. This inhomogeneity could be due to a
distribution of the local coherence length originating from the presence
of randomly distributed impurities/defects. In Fig. 3(c), we show a
statistic on the observed value of the critical field. It is seen that,
while there is inhomogeneity, the majority of the time, the critical
field is found to be around 250 G. This is in agreement with the bulk
critical field measured by our magnetic-field-dependent heat-capacity
measurements and slightly higher than the reported value of bulk
critical field by another group [33]. No magnetic vortices were found in
the conductance images recorded in presence of magnetic field. This is
consistent with the previous claim of type-I bulk superconductivity in
PdTe₂[33].

In conclusion, based on our detailed temperature and
magnetic-field-dependent scanning-tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
experiments, we have shown that, contrary to the speculation of a
topological superconducting phase, the superconducting phase emerging on
the type-II Dirac semimetal PdTe₂ is conventional in nature. The
understanding of the mechanism for the emergence of the unexpectedly
conventional nature of the superconducting phase on PdTe₂ through
detailed theoretical investigation could be a major step forward towards
the understanding of superconductivity emerging in topologically
nontrivial systems under different environments.
