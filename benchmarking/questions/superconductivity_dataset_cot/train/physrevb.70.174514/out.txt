###### Abstract

A (Hg,W)-1232-phase copper oxide has been synthesized in an essentially single-phase form with the composition of (Hg_{0.7}W_{0.3})Sr_{2}(Ce_{0.58}Eu_{0.42})Cu_{2}O_{11+\delta} through high-pressure synthesis at 5 GPa and 1100^{\circ}C. The (Hg,W)-1232 phase contains a three-layer fluorite-structured block between adjacent CuO_{2} planes. The crystal structure was confirmed by x-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission-electron microscopy, and electron diffraction. In contrast to the previously known three-fluorite-layer copper-oxide phases, perfect diamagnetism with a large Meissner volume fraction was revealed for this (Hg,W)-1232 phase. The superconductivity transition temperature T_{c} was found at 33 K.

## I Introduction

The first high-T_{c} superconductor, (La,Ba/Sr)_{2}CuO_{4}, has a simple structure, where two rocksalt (RS) type AO layers with the A site randomly occupied by La and Ba/Sr alternate with a single CuO_{2} plane. The two AO layers are rather flexible to sandwich additional oxygen-nonstichometric perovskite (P) or RS type MO_{1.4\delta m} layers (M = e.g., Cu,Bi,Pb, Tl,Hg) to form a thicker "blocking block" of AO-(MO_{1.6\delta m})_{m}-AO between two CuO_{2} planes. The "superconductive block" may also get thickened having multiple CuO_{2} planes pliped up alternatively with layers of Q cation [Q = e.g., Ca, rare-earth element (R)]. This is the way the most common superconductive copper oxides with a layer sequence of AO-(MO_{1.8\delta m})_{m}-AO-CuO_{2}-(Q-CuO_{2})_{n-1} are formed. Such phases classified into "category A" obey a general chemical formula of M_{m}_{2}O_{m-1}Cu_{2}O_{m+2\delta m\delta} that may be abbreviated by M-m^{3(\mu)}^{2}(\theta(n-1)n or M-m2(n-1)n.^{1,2} At n=2, the two CuO_{2} planes of the superconductive block may further accommodate an additional metal-oxide layer block, B-(O_{2}-B)_{n-1} (B=Ce, other R,Sr), of a fluorite (F) type structure.^{3,-}^{5} The thus formed phases obey a layer sequence of AO[RS]-(MO_{1.6\delta m})_{m}[P/RS]-AO[RS]-CuO_{2}[P]-(B-(O_{2}-B)_{s-1}][F]-CuO_{2}[P] (the additional letters in brackets refer to the structure of the layer) and comprise the second group of multilayered copper oxides, i.e., "category B." From the layer sequence the general formula of a category B phase is derived at M_{m}A_{2k}BCu_{1+k}O_{m+4k+2\pm\delta}, where m\approx 0, s\approx1 and k=0 or 1 (with the conditions that for k=0, m=0, and for k=1, m\approx 0). Furthermore, a phase obeying such formula may be denoted by M-m^{(\lambda)}(2k)^{(\beta)}(1+k) or M-m(2k)s(1+k).^{2} As compared to category A phases, those of category B have been much less investigated. However, a versatile understanding of high-T_{c} superconductivity and the behavior of materials showing this phenomenon is not possible without extending the understanding over both categories of layered copper-oxide phases.

In Fig. 1 a schematic crystal structure of a category B phase is shown. In the known phases of category B, m varies from 0 up to 3, whereas s can be increased even up to 7 or 8 (though single-phase bulk samples have been realized only up to s=3).^{6,-}^{8} Phases with s\approx 3 are rather rare and none of them has been "superconductorized" yet.^{9} At the same time, no definite explanation has been given why these phases do not show superconductivity.^{10} In the present contribution clear evidence is provided that high-T_{c} superconductivity can be induced in a copper-oxide phase containing a three-layer fluorite block.

We focused our hunt for the "three-fluorite-layer superconductor" on Hg-containing systems. Among the category A phases, those with mercury at the "charge-reservoir" M-cation site have shown the highest T_{c} values.^{11,12} Also in the case of category B, the highest T_{c} of 75 K belongs to the Hg-based s=2 phase, i.e., (Hg_{0.75}W_{0.25})Sr_{2}(Ce_{0.25}Gd_{0.75})_{2}Cu_{2}O_{4} or (Hg,W)-1222.^{13} Even though the first samples of the (Hg,M^{\prime})-1222 phase with various M^{\prime} cations were reported already in

Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the crystal structure of an M_{m}A_{2k}B_{x}Cu_{1+k}O_{m+4k+2\pm\delta} or M-m(2k)s(1+k) phase of category B. Only the M_{m}_{m\delta} change-reservoir block of perovskite (P) or rock-salt (RS) type is believed to be oxygen nonstoichiometric.

  1995,[15, 16] the Hg-based s = 3 phase has remained to be uncovered up to now. Here we report both the successful high-pressure synthesis and the bulk superconductivity with T_{c} = 33 K of essentially single-phase samples of (Hg, W)Sr2(Ce, Eu)3Cu2O11+_d_ of the (Hg, W)-1232 phase.

## II Experimental

Samples of (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce1a,Eu)3Cu2O11+_d_ with three different Eu contents of x = 0.33, 0.42, and 0.50 were prepared by a two-step synthesis route. First, a precursor oxide of the cation composition of Sr: (Ce, Eu): Cu = 2:3:2 was prepared from an appropriate mixture of SrCO3, CeO2, Eu2O3 (dehydrated prior to use at 1000 degC for 10 h) and CuO by calcining at 900 degC for 24 h in flowing O2 gas, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. In the second step, nominal amounts of HgO and WO3 were mixed with the Sr-(Ce, Eu)-Cu-O precursor. The thus obtained mixture was tightly packed into a gold capsule covered by a NaCl separator and placed into a prophyllite container equipped with an internal graphite heater. The high-pressure heat treatment was carried out at 5 GPa in a cubic-anvil-type apparatus at 1100 degC for 30 min. After the high-pressure heat treatment, temperature was first quenched in ~10 sec and then pressure was slowly (within ~1 h) released.

The phase content and lattice parameters of the three samples were examined by x-ray powder diffraction (Rigaku: RINT2550VK/U; Cu K_{a} radiation). For the confirmation of the (Hg, W)-1232 crystal structure high-resolution transmission-electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) were carried out using an ultrahigh-voltage transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-1500) operated at an accelerating voltage of 820 kV. A specimen was prepared of the x = 0.42 sample by crushing a portion of it into fine fragments, which were then ultrasonically dispersed in CCl4 and transferred to carbon microgrids. Energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis was carried out under a field-emission transmission electron microscope (Hitachi HF-3000S) to determine the Hg: W and Ce: Eu ratios. Magnetic properties of the samples were measured at 10 Oe down to 5 K by a superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design: MPMS-XL) both in field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) modes. Resistivity measurements were carried out using a four-point-probe apparatus (Quantum Design: PPMS).

## III Results and Discussion

In Fig. 2 x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the three (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce1a,Eu)3Cu2O11+_d_ samples with x = 0.33, 0.42, and 0.50 are shown. For x = 0.42, the diffraction peaks could readily be indexed according to the tetragonal space group P4/_mmm_ (Ref. [17]) expected for an ideal (Hg, W)-1232 structure, with lattice parameters, a = 3.839(3) A and c = 17.33(2) A. Only trace amounts of impurities, CeO2 and Sr2CuWO6, are seen for this sample. For the x = 0.33 sample, the (Hg, W)-1232 phase is still the main phase but the peaks in the XRD pattern due to CeO2 and Sr2CuWO6 have become more prominent. On the other hand, rather than the desired (Hg, W)-1232 phase, the x = 0.50 sample contains the s = 2 or (Hg, W)-1222 phase as the main phase. Here note that commonly seen for category B-type MSr2(Ce1a,R_{x})Cu2O54+_s_ systems is that the s = 3 phase is obtained at x = 0.33 and the s = 2 phase at x = 0.75.[18]

For the x = 0.42 sample we further verified the (Hg, W)-1232 crystal structure from an HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3. A perfect layer repetition of SrO - (Hg, W)O1+_d_-SrO-CuO2 - (Ce, Eu) - O2 - (Ce, Eu) - O2 - (Ce, Eu) - CuO2 without indication of any stacking faults is clearly discerned from the image. In Fig. 4 shown are ED patterns taken for the same sample with the incident beam along the directions, [001], [010], and [1 - 10]. The ED patterns confirm the findings of the XRD and HRTEM data,

Figure 2: X-ray diffraction patterns for the (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce1a,Eu)3Cu2O11+_d_ samples with x = 0.33, 0.42, and 0.50. The indices given for the most phase-pure x = 0.42 sample are for the (Hg, W)-1232 structure on the basis of space group P4/_mmm_. Small amounts of CeO2 and Sr2CuWO6 are seen for all samples as an impurity. The x = 0.50 sample is a mixture of the two copper-oxide phases, (Hg, W)-1232 and (Hg, W)-1222.

  namely a tetragonal lattice with the a:c ratio approximately 1:4. Also the possibility of superstructures was ruled out on the basis of the ED data. From the TEM-EDX analysis data the cation ratios, Hg:W and Ce:Eu, were determined at 0.67:0.33, and 0.56:0.44, respectively, both very close to the corresponding nominal ratios of 0.70:0.30, and 0.58:0.42.

The temperature dependence of magnetization measured in both FC and ZFC modes at 10 Oe for the essentially phase-pure x=0.42 sample (Fig. 5) revealed a strong diamagnetic signal with the onset temperature at 33 K. The superconducting volume fraction as estimated from the ZFC curve at 5 K is around 59%. Since the two impurity phases, Sr2CuWO6 and CeO2, seen in trace amounts in the XRD pattern for the x=0.42 sample are both nonsuperconductive, we conclude that the large diamagnetic signal detected for this sample is a manifestation of bulk superconductivity of the (Hg,W)-1232 phase. The resistivity (\rho) versus temperature (T) curve for the same sample is shown in Fig. 6. The superconductivity transition is manifested with a clear downturn in resistivity about 30 K. Apparently the quality of grain boundaries in our (Hg,W)-1232 sample is not high. This is rather common for high-pressure-synthesized samples. Accordingly the superconductivity transition behavior superimposes on a semiconductive-type one of the grain boundaries. We therefore determined the superconductivity transition temperature as d^{2}\rho/dT^{2}\approx 0 to obtain a value of \sim34 K that is in good agreement with the value at the diamagnetic onset revealed from the magnetization measurement.

The T_{c} value of 33-34 K for our as-synthesized (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)_{5}Cu2O11+\delta sample of the (Hg,W)-1232 phase is only half of the value reported for the (Hg,W)-1222 phase, i.e., 75 K for (Hg0.75W0.25)Sr2(Ce0.25Gd0.75)_{2}Cu2O2._{c}[13, 14] However, this does not necessarily mean that an s=3 phase would intrinsically have a lower T_{c} than the corresponding s=2 phase. Rather we believe that our as-high-pressure-synthesized (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)_{5}Cu2O11+\delta sample is not yet optimized in terms of hole doping. A rough estimate of the valence state of copper is obtained at 2.03 by assuming the ideal stoichiometry of (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)_{5}Cu2O11

  for the (Hg,W)-1232 phase and valence states, +II, +VI, +II, +IV, +III, and -II for Hg, W, Sr, Ce, Eu, and O, respectively. For comparison, a similar calculation for the (Hg,W)-1222 phase using a stoichiometry of (Hg0.75W0.25)Sr2(Ce0.25Gd0.75)2Cu2O9 reveals a Cu valence value of 2.25. It thus seems that our (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)3Cu2O11+,\delta sample is in an underdoped state. The fact that the high-pressure synthesis was carried out without an additional oxygen source is in line with this suggestion. The third fact pointing to the same direction is that the T_{c} values as revealed from magnetization measurements for the other two (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce1-xEu)3Cu2O11+,\delta samples with x =0.33 and 0.50 were 26 K and 45 K, respectively. In other words, it seems that T_{c} is gradually increased upon increasing the hole-doping level through aliovalent EuIII-for-CeIV substitution, i.e., T_{c}=26 K (_x_ =0.33), 33 K (_x_ =0.42), and 45 K (_x_ =0.50). Unfortunately the solid-solution range for tuning the Eu/Ce ratio in (Hg,W)-1232 was found rather narrow, and it should be remembered that even the presently employed end stoichiometries of x =0.33 and 0.50 yielded multiphase samples. We also made preliminary efforts to introduce more oxygen in the (Hg,W)-1232 phase. However, a postannealing carried out in O2 gas (at 250^{\circ}C) did not increase the T_{c} value but rather decreased it by few degrees, presumably due to some Hg loss. Note that T_{c} was also found to decrease by few degrees when postannealing the sample in N2 (at 250^{\circ}C). A more systematic study has been initiated on the possibility of increasing the T_{c} value of the (Hg,W)-1232 phase by controlling the W and Eu contents and/or tuning the oxygen content.

## IV Conclusion

In terms of the possible copper-oxide host lattices for the high-T_{c} superconductivity, we have successfully extended the variety to the 1232-type layered structure in which the CuO2 planes are separated from each other by a rather thick fluorite-structured (Ce,R)-O_{2}-(Ce,R) block. For our as-synthesized (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)3Cu2O11+,\delta sample of the three-fluorite-layer (Hg,W)-1232 phase, T_{c} for bulk superconductivity was found at 33 K. Further optimization of the hole-doping level is apparently required to reach higher T_{c} values.

## I Introduction

The first high-T_{c} superconductor, (La,Ba/Sr)_{2}CuO_{4}, has a simple structure, where two rocksalt (RS) type AO layers with the A site randomly occupied by La and Ba/Sr alternate with a single CuO_{2} plane.

The "superconductive block" may also get thickened having multiple CuO_{2} planes pliped up alternatively with layers of Q cation [Q = e.g., Ca, rare-earth element (R)]. This is the way the most common superconductive copper oxides with a layer sequence of AO-(MO_{1.8\delta m})_{m}-AO-CuO_{2}-(Q-CuO_{2})_{n-1} are formed. Such phases classified into "category A" obey a general chemical formula of M_{m}_{2}O_{m-1}Cu_{2}O_{m+2\delta m\delta} that may be abbreviated by M-m^{3(\mu)}^{2}(\theta(n-1)n or M-m2(n-1)n.^{1,2} At n=2, the two CuO_{2} planes of the superconductive block may further accommodate an additional metal-oxide layer block, B-(O_{2}-B)_{n-1} (B=Ce, other R,Sr), of a fluorite (F) type structure.^{3,-}^{5} The thus formed phases obey a layer sequence of AO[RS]-(MO_{1.6\delta m})_{m}[P/RS]-AO[RS]-CuO_{2}[P]-(B-(O_{2}-B)_{s-1}][F]-CuO_{2}[P] (the additional letters in brackets refer to the structure of the layer) and comprise the second group of multilayered copper oxides, i.e., "category B." From the layer sequence the general formula of a category B phase is derived at M_{m}A_{2k}BCu_{1+k}O_{m+4k+2\pm\delta}, where m\approx 0, s\approx1 and k=0 or 1 (with the conditions that for k=0, m=0, and for k=1, m\approx 0). Furthermore, a phase obeying such formula may be denoted by M-m^{(\lambda)}(2k)^{(\beta)}(1+k) or M-m(2k)s(1+k).^{2} As compared to category A phases, those of category B have been much less investigated. However, a versatile understanding of high-T_{c} superconductivity and the behavior of materials showing this phenomenon is not possible without extending the understanding over both categories of layered copper-oxide phases.

In Fig. 1 a schematic crystal structure of a category B phase is shown. In the known phases of category B, m varies from 0 up to 3, whereas s can be increased even up to 7 or 8 (though single-phase bulk samples have been realized only up to s=3).^{6,-}^{8} Phases with s\approx 3 are rather rare and none of them has been "superconductorized" yet.^{9} At the same time, no definite explanation has been given why these phases do not show superconductivity.^{10} In the present contribution clear evidence is provided that high-T_{c} superconductivity can be induced in a copper-oxide phase containing a three-layer fluorite block.

  1995,[15, 16] the Hg-based s = 3 phase has remained to be uncovered up to now. Here we report both the successful high-pressure synthesis and the bulk superconductivity with T_{c} = 33 K of essentially single-phase samples of (Hg, W)Sr2(Ce, Eu)3Cu2O11+_d_ of the (Hg, W)-1232 phase.

## II Experimental

Samples of (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce1a,Eu)3Cu2O11+_d_ with three different Eu contents of x = 0.33, 0.42, and 0.50 were prepared by a two-step synthesis route. First, a precursor oxide of the cation composition of Sr: (Ce, Eu): Cu = 2:3:2 was prepared from an appropriate mixture of SrCO3, CeO2, Eu2O3 (dehydrated prior to use at 1000 degC for 10 h) and CuO by calcining at 900 degC for 24 h in flowing O2 gas, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. In the second step, nominal amounts of HgO and WO3 were mixed with the Sr-(Ce, Eu)-Cu-O precursor. The thus obtained mixture was tightly packed into a gold capsule covered by a NaCl separator and placed into a prophyllite container equipped with an internal graphite heater. The high-pressure heat treatment was carried out at 5 GPa in a cubic-anvil-type apparatus at 1100 degC for 30 min. After the high-pressure heat treatment, temperature was first quenched in ~10 sec and then pressure was slowly (within ~1 h) released.

The phase content and lattice parameters of the three samples were examined by x-ray powder diffraction (Rigaku: RINT2550VK/U; Cu K_{a} radiation). For the confirmation of the (Hg, W)-1232 crystal structure high-resolution transmission-electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) were carried out using an ultrahigh-voltage transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-1500) operated at an accelerating voltage of 820 kV. A specimen was prepared of the x = 0.42 sample by crushing a portion of it into fine fragments, which were then ultrasonically dispersed in CCl4 and transferred to carbon microgrids. Energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis was carried out under a field-emission transmission electron microscope (Hitachi HF-3000S) to determine the Hg: W and Ce: Eu ratios. Magnetic properties of the samples were measured at 10 Oe down to 5 K by a superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design: MPMS-XL) both in field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) modes. Resistivity measurements were carried out using a four-point-probe apparatus (Quantum Design: PPMS).

## III Results and Discussion

In Fig. 2 x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the three (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce1a,Eu)3Cu2O11+_d_ samples with x = 0.33, 0.42, and 0.50 are shown. For x = 0.42, the diffraction peaks could readily be indexed according to the tetragonal space group P4/_mmm_ (Ref. [17]) expected for an ideal (Hg, W)-1232 structure, with lattice parameters, a = 3.839(3) A and c = 17.33(2) A. Only trace amounts of impurities, CeO2 and Sr2CuWO6, are seen for this sample. For the x = 0.33 sample, the (Hg, W)-1232 phase is still the main phase but the peaks in the XRD pattern due to CeO2 and Sr2CuWO6 have become more prominent. On the other hand, rather than the desired (Hg, W)-1232 phase, the x = 0.50 sample contains the s = 2 or (Hg, W)-1222 phase as the main phase. Here note that commonly seen for category B-type MSr2(Ce1a,R_{x})Cu2O54+_s_ systems is that the s = 3 phase is obtained at x = 0.33 and the s = 2 phase at x = 0.75.[18]

For the x = 0.42 sample we further verified the (Hg, W)-1232 crystal structure from an HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3. A perfect layer repetition of SrO - (Hg, W)O1+_d_-SrO-CuO2 - (Ce, Eu) - O2 - (Ce, Eu) - O2 - (Ce, Eu) - CuO2 without indication of any stacking faults is clearly discerned from the image. In Fig. 4 shown are ED patterns taken for the same sample with the incident beam along the directions, [001], [010], and [1 - 10]. The ED patterns confirm the findings of the XRD and HRTEM data,

The indices given for the most phase-pure x = 0.42 sample are for the (Hg, W)-1232 structure on the basis of space group P4/_mmm_. Small amounts of CeO2 and Sr2CuWO6 are seen for all samples as an impurity. The x = 0.50 sample is a mixture of the two copper-oxide phases, (Hg, W)-1232 and (Hg, W)-1222.

  namely a tetragonal lattice with the a:c ratio approximately 1:4. Also the possibility of superstructures was ruled out on the basis of the ED data. From the TEM-EDX analysis data the cation ratios, Hg:W and Ce:Eu, were determined at 0.67:0.33, and 0.56:0.44, respectively, both very close to the corresponding nominal ratios of 0.70:0.30, and 0.58:0.42.

The temperature dependence of magnetization measured in both FC and ZFC modes at 10 Oe for the essentially phase-pure x=0.42 sample (Fig. 5) revealed a strong diamagnetic signal with the onset temperature at 33 K. The superconducting volume fraction as estimated from the ZFC curve at 5 K is around 59%. Since the two impurity phases, Sr2CuWO6 and CeO2, seen in trace amounts in the XRD pattern for the x=0.42 sample are both nonsuperconductive, we conclude that the large diamagnetic signal detected for this sample is a manifestation of bulk superconductivity of the (Hg,W)-1232 phase. The resistivity (\rho) versus temperature (T) curve for the same sample is shown in Fig. 6. The superconductivity transition is manifested with a clear downturn in resistivity about 30 K. Apparently the quality of grain boundaries in our (Hg,W)-1232 sample is not high. This is rather common for high-pressure-synthesized samples. Accordingly the superconductivity transition behavior superimposes on a semiconductive-type one of the grain boundaries. We therefore determined the superconductivity transition temperature as d^{2}\rho/dT^{2}\approx 0 to obtain a value of \sim34 K that is in good agreement with the value at the diamagnetic onset revealed from the magnetization measurement.

The T_{c} value of 33-34 K for our as-synthesized (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)_{5}Cu2O11+\delta sample of the (Hg,W)-1232 phase is only half of the value reported for the (Hg,W)-1222 phase, i.e., 75 K for (Hg0.75W0.25)Sr2(Ce0.25Gd0.75)_{2}Cu2O2._{c}[13, 14] However, this does not necessarily mean that an s=3 phase would intrinsically have a lower T_{c} than the corresponding s=2 phase. Rather we believe that our as-high-pressure-synthesized (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)_{5}Cu2O11+\delta sample is not yet optimized in terms of hole doping. A rough estimate of the valence state of copper is obtained at 2.03 by assuming the ideal stoichiometry of (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)_{5}Cu2O11

  for the (Hg,W)-1232 phase and valence states, +II, +VI, +II, +IV, +III, and -II for Hg, W, Sr, Ce, Eu, and O, respectively. For comparison, a similar calculation for the (Hg,W)-1222 phase using a stoichiometry of (Hg0.75W0.25)Sr2(Ce0.25Gd0.75)2Cu2O9 reveals a Cu valence value of 2.25. It thus seems that our (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)3Cu2O11+,\delta sample is in an underdoped state. The fact that the high-pressure synthesis was carried out without an additional oxygen source is in line with this suggestion. The third fact pointing to the same direction is that the T_{c} values as revealed from magnetization measurements for the other two (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce1-xEu)3Cu2O11+,\delta samples with x =0.33 and 0.50 were 26 K and 45 K, respectively. In other words, it seems that T_{c} is gradually increased upon increasing the hole-doping level through aliovalent EuIII-for-CeIV substitution, i.e., T_{c}=26 K (_x_ =0.33), 33 K (_x_ =0.42), and 45 K (_x_ =0.50). Unfortunately the solid-solution range for tuning the Eu/Ce ratio in (Hg,W)-1232 was found rather narrow, and it should be remembered that even the presently employed end stoichiometries of x =0.33 and 0.50 yielded multiphase samples. We also made preliminary efforts to introduce more oxygen in the (Hg,W)-1232 phase. However, a postannealing carried out in O2 gas (at 250^{\circ}C) did not increase the T_{c} value but rather decreased it by few degrees, presumably due to some Hg loss. Note that T_{c} was also found to decrease by few degrees when postannealing the sample in N2 (at 250^{\circ}C). A more systematic study has been initiated on the possibility of increasing the T_{c} value of the (Hg,W)-1232 phase by controlling the W and Eu contents and/or tuning the oxygen content.

## IV Conclusion

In terms of the possible copper-oxide host lattices for the high-T_{c} superconductivity, we have successfully extended the variety to the 1232-type layered structure in which the CuO2 planes are separated from each other by a rather thick fluorite-structured (Ce,R)-O_{2}-(Ce,R) block. For our as-synthesized (Hg0.7W0.3)Sr2(Ce0.58Eu0.42)3Cu2O11+,\delta sample of the three-fluorite-layer (Hg,W)-1232 phase, T_{c} for bulk superconductivity was found at 33 K. Further optimization of the hole-doping level is apparently required to reach higher T_{c} values.
