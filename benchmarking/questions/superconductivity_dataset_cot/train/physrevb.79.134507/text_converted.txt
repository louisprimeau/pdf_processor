###### Abstract

Heat capacity, magnetic susceptibility, NMR, and resistivity of SrNi₂P₂
single crystals are presented, illustrating a purely structural
transition at 325 K with no magnetism. Bulk superconductivity is found
at 1.4 K. The magnitude of the transition temperature T_(c), fits to the
heat-capacity data, the small upper critical field H_(c2) = 390 Oe, and
Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ=2.1 suggest a conventional fully gapped
superconductor. With applied pressure a second structural phase
transition occurs which results in an 8

## I Introduction

There have long been attempts to identify structure-property relations
in superconducting materials that help in the identification of the
pairing mechanism and the enhancement of the superconducting transition
temperature. The discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in LaFeAsO (Ref.
[1]) has stimulated much recent work in compounds containing _T_-Pn
layers (_T_=transition metal and Pn=pnictide). The highest transition
temperatures to date are found in the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs structure type
[e.g., 55 K in SmFeAs(O,F) (Ref. [2])], and a correlation has been
identified between the As-Fe-As bond angle and T_(c).[3] Clearly,
structural tuning can have a very dramatic effect on superconducting
transition temperatures and further structure-property relations are
needed to help guide the discovery of higher transition temperatures.

Reasonably high transition temperatures also have been found in the
ThCr₂Si₂ structure [i.e., 38 K in (Ba, K)Fe₂As₂].[4] The ThCr₂Si₂
structure is stable for two different bonding configurations between the
atoms in the Si position of neighboring Cr₂Si₂ planes. Either the atoms
in the Si Si position are sufficiently far apart that they are in a
nonbonding state or they are close enough together that they are bonding
(typical of single bond distances).[5] Consequently, depending on the
elements in the tetragonal ThCr₂Si₂ structure, one can induce an
isostructural volume collapse with either substitution or pressure.[6,
7, 8, 9] We will refer to the bonding configuration as the "collapsed
tetragonal" structure. Due to the increased bonding between layers, it
is natural to anticipate that the collapsed tetragonal phase will be
electronically more three dimensional (i.e., Fermi velocity ratio
v_(x)/v_(z) closer to 1) than the nonbonding configuration. With Fe₂As₂
planes, the ThCr₂Si₂ structure generally adopts a nonbonding
configuration between As atoms from neighboring planes. One exception is
that CaFe₂As₂ can be driven into the collapsed tetragonal state with
pressure.[10] Interestingly, while the homogeneous collapsed tetragonal
state does not show signs of superconductivity down to 2 K,[11] by using
different pressure mediums a structurally inhomogeneous scenario is
induced[12] which possesses an onset of superconductivity at 13 K.[13,
14] This poses the question of what is the role of the collapsed
tetragonal phase (and dimensionality in general) for superconductivity.

We attempt to shed light on this question with a study of SrNi₂P₂. At
ambient pressure, SrNi₂P₂ crystallizes in the large tetragonal state
above 325 K with an interlayer P-P distance of 3.120 A corresponding to
a nonbonding condition.[6] Below 325 K, the system undergoes an
orthorhombic distortion (_Immm_ space group) with a buckling in the
Ni₂P₂ planes causing the interlayer P-P distance to oscillate between
3.282 A (nonbonding) and 2.452 A (bonding). With NMR measurements we
show that there is no magnetism associated with this transition. By
applying pressure, the collapsed tetragonal state can be induced with
slight pressure (4 kbar at room temperature).[6] Here, we first identify
that SrNi₂P₂ is a bulk superconductor at ambient pressure with T_(c)=1.4
K. An analysis of the data is consistent with a fully gapped
conventional superconductor. By applying pressure, we find that the
transition temperature is suppressed by less than 50

## II Experimental

Large platelike single crystals of SrNi₂P₂ were grown in Sn flux
following the general recipe described in Ref. [15]. The starting
materials in the ratio of Sr:Ni:P:Sn =1.3:2:2.3:16 were placed in an
alumina crucible and sealed under vacuum in a quartz tube. The contents
were then heated to 600 ^(∘)C for 4 h followed by 900 ^(∘)C for 200 h.
Subsequently the charge was cooled to 650 ^(∘)C at a rate of 3.5 ^(∘)C/h
at which point the excess Sn was spun off with the aid of a centrifuge.
Powder x-ray diffraction confirms that the large platelike crystals with
typical dimensions 5 x 5 x 0.2 mm3 were SrNi₂P₂.6

Specific-heat measurements were performed using an adiabatic relaxation
technique in a Quantum Design PPMS. Resistance measurements were also
performed in a Quantum Design PPMS using a linear research resistance
bridge with an excitation current of 0.1 mA. Susceptibility measurements
were performed in a Quantum Design MPMS with an applied field of 5 T.
Results were in good agreement with data at 0.01 T, confirming that no
ferromagnetic impurity contribution exists in the sample. ³¹P NMR was
performed using a phase-coherent pulsed spectrometer. The external field
was applied along the c axis.

For pressure measurements, a crystal was mounted inside a Teflon cup
within a hybrid BeCu/NiCrAl clamp-type pressure cell with silicon oil as
the pressure transmitting medium. The cup also contained a small piece
of Pb whose known pressure-dependent superconducting transition [16]
enabled a determination of the pressure within the cell at low
temperatures where the superconductivity is measured.

## III Results

The in-plane resistivity of SrNi₂P₂ is shown in Fig. 1 and demonstrates
a sharp first-order anomaly with thermal hysteresis associated with the
structural transition previously observed in x-ray diffraction
measurements.6 Here we find the transition occurs at 325 K upon warming
and 320 K upon cooling. The first-order transition is further confirmed
by magnetic-susceptibility measurements shown in Fig. 2. The
susceptibility also shows the first-order transition at 325 K (upon
warming) and 322 K (upon cooling). Interestingly, the susceptibility in
the high-temperature phase is isotropic, but below the transition
becomes anisotropic. While anisotropic g factors can result in an
anisotropic Pauli susceptibility it is surprising that only the
low-temperature phase shows this anisotropy.

To explore whether or not the susceptibility results could imply
magnetic ordering or a changing magnetic moment coincident with the
structural transition, we performed ³¹P NMR above and below the
transition (see Fig. 3). The data above the transition show a very sharp
double peak, indicative of very high crystallinity. Since only a single
peak is

H∥ab and H∥c, respectively.

anticipated in the high-temperature ThCr2Si2 structure, the double peak
at 332 K may be a consequence of either a slightly twinned sample or a
small structural distortion possibly caused by thermally cycling through
the structural transition. Upon lowering temperature through the
transition, one sees that the central peak loses some intensity and a
second double peak structure grows in at slightly higher frequencies.
This is as expected on the basis of the structural transition alone for
which there are now expected to be two inequivalent P positions
populated in a ratio of 2:1.6 The fact that the central line does not
shift or broaden at all implies that there is no internal field on the P
sites which remain in the same crystallographic environment.
Consequently, we can conclude that there is no magnetic order or a
change in magnetic moment coincident with the structural transition at
325 K.

The resistivity below the structural transition is characteristic of a
good metal with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) [=_r_(300 K)/_r_(4
K)] of 40 and a residual resistivity of 1.8+-0.2 _m_D cm. At 1.45 K the
sample shows a sharp transition in resistivity which is consistent with
bulk superconductivity as established by heat-capacity measurements
shown below. With an applied magnetic field the superconducting
transition is rapidly suppressed indicating a very small upper critical
field. In addition, with an applied magnetic field there is a slight
upturn in the resistivity before the superconducting transition. A
similar feature has been observed in other iron-based pnictide
superconductors and is discussed in Ref. [17].

Specific-heat data at low temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. A fit of the
data (not shown) from 1.5 to 10 K to C/T=g + _bT_2+ _dT_4 gives g=15
mJ/mol K2 and b =0.23 mJ/mol K4, which implies a Debye temperature
_th__D_ of 348 K. Using a zero-temperature susceptibility of _kh_0
=[2_kh_0 (2 K) + _kh_(2 K)]/3=1.86 emu/mol, we find a Wilson ratio _R_W
of 0.9 using the expression _R_W = π²k_(B)²/3μ_(B)²⟨x₀²/γ⟩.

Bulk superconductivity is established by specific-heat measurements. By
an equal area construction the specific heat gives a transition
temperature of 1.415 K, consistent with the drop in resistivity. The
fact that the low-temperature specific heat gives a jump D_C_/g_T_c
=1.27 confirms the bulk nature of superconductivity. From BCS theory we
expect the specific heat to be given by the formula

$$C_{\text{BCS}} = t\frac{d}{dt}{\int_{0}^{\infty}{dy\left( {- \frac{6\gamma\Delta_{0}}{k_{B}\pi^{2}}} \right)\left[ {f\ln f + (1 - f)\ln(1 - f)} \right\rbrack}},$$

where t = 1/_T_c, f = 1/[exp(_E_/_k_B_T_) + 1], E = (_e_2 + l2)1/2, y =
_e_/_D_0, and (_T_)/D_0 is taken from the tables of Muhlschlegel.18 The
specific-heat curve, obtained by fixing g = 15 mJ/mol K2 from the
high-temperature fit _T_c = 1.415 K and D0 to the weak-coupling BCS
value =1.76_k_B_T_c, is shown by the solid black curve in Fig. 4(b).
Allowing the zero-temperature gap value D0 to vary we obtain the dashed
blue curve and find D0=0.201 meV =1.65_k_B_T_c. With the fitted curve to
the specific heat, we can extract the condensation energy and equate it
to the thermodynamic critical field giving _H_c = 185 Oe. The reason
that the best fit to the specific heat gives a value of D0 _below_ the
weak-coupling value is uncertain, but may be caused by pair breaking
impurities.19 We note that in several related superconductors the
specific-heat jump is also slightly smaller than the weak-coupling BCS
expectation of D_C_/g_T_c = 1.43.20-24

As mentioned above, the upper critical fields of SrNi2P2 are small. In
Fig. 5 we plot the upper critical field deduced from the midpoint of the
resistive transition as well as the midpoint of the specific-heat
curves. There is a slight anisotropy observed for the resistivity data.
The upper critical field as determined by heat capacity is slightly
lower, but surprisingly shows no anisotropy. The slope of the upper
critical field from heat capacity is _dH_c2/_dT_c = -0.039 T/K. This
gives an upper critical field of 390 Oe using

the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula H_(c2)^(*)(0) =
-0.7T,_dH_,c2/_dT_c_ (Ref. 25) and a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length
_x_GL=920 A from the expression _H__c_2(0) = Φ₀/2πξ_(GL)², where Φ₀=2.07
x 10-77 Oe cm2 is the flux quantum. From the relations
_H__c_/_H__c_1=_H__c_2/_H__c_=_kh_ = $\sqrt{2\kappa}$/_x_GL, we extract
_k_=2.1, _H__c_1=88 Oe, and _k_eff = 1935 A.

To investigate the influence of the crystal structure on
superconductivity, we applied pressure to SnNi2P2. At room temperature
it is known that the orthorhombic structure transforms to a collapsed
tetragonal structure at 4 kbar.[6, 8] Based on the pressure-temperature
phase diagram for the structural collapse in CaFe2As2 (Ref. 11) we
anticipate that at lower temperatures the structural transition to the
"collapsed tetragonal" phase in SrNi2P2 will occur at pressures less
than 4 kbar. The structural transformation results in a volume change of
-3.9

## IV Discussion

Several results from the ambient pressure data of SrNi2P2 are suggestive
of a fully gapped BCS superconductor, including the fit to the
heat-capacity data, the small value of _H__c_2, and k. Band-structure
calculations for SrNi2P2 give a density of states _N_(E_(F))=43
states/Ry cell.[9, 26] This gives an electron-boson renormalization l =
1.02, from the expression γ= π2k2_N_(E_(F))(1+_l_)/3, using the
experimentally measured g = 15 mJ/mol K2. This is certainly sufficient
to explain superconductivity in an electron-phonon pairing scenario. For
example, using the simplified McMillan formula[27]

$$T_{c} = \frac{\Theta_{D}}{1.45}\text{exp}\left[ {- \frac{1.04(1 + \lambda)}{\lambda - \mu^{\ast}(1 + 0.62\lambda)}} \right\rbrack$$

and a very conservative estimate of _m_’= 0.3 gives T_(c) =4.5 K.
Furthermore, calculations show that BaNi2P2 has a larger density of
states (γ^(h)=9.32 mJ/mol K2) (Ref. 9)

several magnetic fields applied in the plane of SrNi2P2. (b) The
zero-field heat-capacity data (circles) along with the theoretical
expectation of the specific heat based on a purely weak-coupling BCS
picture (solid black curve). Fit Δa (dashed blue line) is a fit to the
BCS expression holding T_(c) = 1.415 K, g = 15 mJ/mol K2 constant as
described in the text.

which is consistent with its larger superconducting transition
temperature (T_(c)=2.7 K).[28] In addition, low-temperature
thermal-conductivity data provide compelling evidence for fully gapped
superconductivity in the related material BaNi₂As₂.[21] While not
definitive, the accumulation of evidence suggests that SrNi₂P₂ is a
conventional BCS superconductor.

An open question is whether the pairing mechanisms of the Fe-based
systems and the Ni-based compounds are related. On the basis of
band-structure calculations it has been argued that both T=Fe and T=Ni
lie close to a magnetic instability;[29] however it remains the case
that none of the Ni-based systems possess superconducting transition
temperatures in excess of 5 K (Refs. [20, 22, 23, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37] nor do they have evidence for magnetism. Density
functional calculations suggest that the two systems have unrelated
pairing mechanisms based on the fact that they are unable to reproduce
the high transition temperatures of the Fe-based compounds.[38, 39]
However, it remains a possibility that the pairing mechanisms of the
Ni-based systems are merely not as optimized for superconductivity as
their iron-based coussins.

It is rather remarkable that superconductivity has been found in many of
the nickel analogs for which the iron-based pnictide compounds also
superconducts. Figure 7 shows that even the trend of the maximum
superconducting transition temperature decreases monotonically from
ReX(O,F) to BaX₂ to SrX₂ to CaX₂ irrespective of whether X=FeAs, NiAs,
or NiP. A possible interpretation of this trend is that T_(c) is
suppressed with increasing dimensionality or, in other words, as the
electronic structure becomes more isotropic. Comparison between the
ZrCuSiAs and ThCr₂Si₂ structure types has already established that the
electronic structure of the systems in the ThCr₂Si₂ structure are more
three dimensional than those in the ZrCuSiAs structure.[40] Within the
ThCr₂Si₂ structure this can be further understood from the decreasing
ionic radius in going from Ba to Sr to Ca.[59] Consequently, the
pnictide atoms are closer together allowing for stronger hybridization
along the c axis. Eventually the decreasing pnictide-pnictide distance
will lead to the collapsed tetragonal state where the interlayer
pnictides adopt a bonding configuration, which should be the most three
dimensional due to the increased P-P hybridization along the z
direction, and hence the least favorable for superconductivity. Our
results, which show that superconductivity in SrNi₂P₂ is suppressed upon
entering the collapsed tetragonal phase, further support the notion that
increased three dimensionality found in the collapsed tetragonal state
at higher pressures is detrimental for superconductivity. Further work
is needed to determine how precisely dimensionality in terms of
structural, magnetic, and electronic anisotropies influences the
correlation between families observed in Fig. 7. Irrespective of the
origin of the trend, this work suggests that CaNi₂P₂ and CaNi₂As₂ will
be superconducting at temperatures below 1.4 and 0.62 K, respectively.

the FeAs series, T_(c) for SmFeAs(O,F) and for hole doping on the Ba,
Sr, Ca site was chosen (Refs. [2, 4, 41, and 42, respectively]. T_(c)
for the NiP and NiAs were taken from Refs. [31] and [28], this work, and
Refs. [33, 20], and [22], respectively.

## V Conclusion

In conclusion, by ³¹P NMR we have demonstrated the lack of magnetism in
SrNi₂P₂. We have also shown that SrNi₂P₂ is a bulk superconductor at
ambient pressure at 1.4 K. Upon entering the collapsed tetragonal phase
with applied pressure, the superconducting transition temperature is
monotonically suppressed. Further work is necessary to determine whether
SrNi₂P₂ under pressure is the first transition-metal pnictide in the
ThCr₂Si₂ structure to possess bulk superconductivity or whether a
similar unknown mechanism as occurs in CaFe₂As₂ is at play. The
suppression of T_(c) with pressure and across families of compounds
demonstrates the notion that increased two dimensionality is a mechanism
through which higher T_(c)’s can be achieved.
