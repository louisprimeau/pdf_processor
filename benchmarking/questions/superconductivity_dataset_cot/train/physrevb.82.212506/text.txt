###### Abstract

We have measured magnetic susceptibility of iron pnictide superconductors SmFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and PrFe\({}_{0.925}\)Co\({}_{0.075}\)AsO under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.15 GPa. The superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{\rm C}\)) decreases linearly and the Meissner signal size also decreases with increasing pressure for SmFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\). In contrast, the \(T_{\rm C}\) of PrFe\({}_{0.925}\)Co\({}_{0.075}\)AsO initially increases with pressure then saturates above \(\sim\)0.8 GPa. Meanwhile its Meissner signal exhibits the similar pressure dependence. Our results indicate that the pressure dependences of \(T_{\rm C}\) and superfluid density in both systems are positively correlated which suggests that these quaternary iron-based superconductors are not conventional BCS ones.

  K, and \(H\) the applied field. The data in the vicinity of \(T_{\rm C}\) are expanded in Fig. 1(b). Opposite to the naive thinking that pressure would increase the carrier density via lattice shrinking so that it would enhance \(T_{\rm C}\), the superconducting transition shifts toward lower temperature with pressure, indicating a negative pressure coefficient of \(T_{\rm C}\). Here the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{\rm C}\) is defined as the temperature where the field cooling \(4\,\pi\chi_{\rm FC}\) decreases down to \(-1\times 10^{-3}\) [as indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 1(b)]. As plotted in Fig. 3(c), the \(T_{\rm C}\) decreases from 54.6 to 53.4 K with hydrostatic pressure increasing from 0.07 to 1.1 GPa, at an almost constant rate \(dT_{\rm C}/dP\,^{\infty}\)\(-\)1.1 K/GPa. Furthermore, the FC susceptibility below \(T_{\rm C}\) also shows a negative pressure dependence as indicated in Fig. 1(c) by the arrow. Illustrated in Fig. 3(d) is the curve of Meissner signal size taken as the FC susceptibility at 5 K, \(4\,\pi\chi_{\rm S~{}K}\), which decreases linearly with increasing pressure at a rate of \(d(4\,\pi\chi_{\rm S~{}K})/dP\,^{\infty}\)\(=\)\(-\)0.014/GPa.

Now turn to the case of Pr-15 sample. We note that although both samples share the same crystal structure of 1111 family, the charge carriers in Pr-15 are directly introduced within FeAs layer by Co substitution while the carriers in Sm-55 sample are produced by O vacancy out of the FeAs layer. As mentioned above, the \(T_{\rm C}\) of Pr-15 is 15 K, which is the highest \(T_{\rm C}\) reachable in Co-doped PrFeAsO system indicating that this sample is optimally doped one. As shown in Fig. 2, the superconducting transition of Pr-15 shifts toward higher temperature under pressure. Plotted in Fig. 3(a) is the quantitative pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm C}\) where \(T_{\rm C}\) is determined in the same way as that for Sm-55 sample as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. It can be seen that the \(T_{\rm C}\) rises linearly when pressure increases from 0.25 to 0.8 GPa then it becomes saturated up to the highest pressure, 1.15 GPa, achievable in this work. One may find from Fig. 2 that the Meissner signal size is also somewhat lifted by hydrostatic pressure. Plotted in Fig. 3(b) are the data of Meissner signal taken as the FC susceptibility at 4.5 K. Interestingly, the Meissner signal also first rises from 0.16 to 0.17 with pressure then remains almost unchanged when pressure increases from 0.8 GPa up to 1.15 GPa, showing a similar pressure dependence as that of \(T_{\rm C}\). A clear comparison can thus be made from Fig. 3 for the pressure effects of Pr-15 and Sm-55 samples. Both samples exhibit a close correlation between the pressure dependences of their \(T_{\rm C}\)'s and Meissner signals: they either simultaneously increase or decrease or keep almost constant with applied pressure.

When the average grain size \(2r\) in the direction perpendicular to applied field is comparable to magnetic penetration depth \(\lambda\), the ideal diamagnetic susceptibility of a granular superconductor is a function of \(\lambda\) and \(r\), [15]\(4\,\pi\chi_{\rm I}\)\(=\)\(-\)1 + \(\frac{3\lambda}{r}\)coth\(\frac{r}{\lambda}\)\(-\)\(\frac{3\lambda^{2}}{r^{2}}\). In this study, grains in the polycrystalline samples are randomly oriented, the overall susceptibility should be reduced to one third of the ideal value, i.e., \(4\,\pi\chi\) =\(-\)\(\frac{1}{3}\) + \(\frac{\lambda_{ab}}{r}\)coth\(\frac{r}{\lambda_{ab}}\)\(-\)\(\frac{3\lambda^{2}}{r^{2}}\), when considering the anisotropy of penetration depth. Here \(\lambda_{ab}\) denotes the in-plane penetration depth \(\lambda_{ab}\) under ambient condition as about 200-350 nm for 1111 iron-based superconductors. [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] Since the average grain size in present samples is about 6\(-\)20 \(\,\mu\)m as mention above, the values of

  4_p_Y can thus be estimated as between about -0.23 and -0.31 according to this formula. This is in the same order of the ambient 4_p_Y's we observed for Sm-55 and Pr-15 samples, which are about -0.12 and -0.15, respectively. The lower values of measured Meissner signal than the calculated ones imply that the pinning effects are significant, which are most likely due to the existence of the amorphous impurities and grain-boundary cracks as revealed by backscattered electron imaging and orientation imaging microscopy.[18] Fortunately, in the present work where the maximum pressure is only ~1 GPa, it can be safely assumed that the pressure effect on the pinning, if any, is not strong enough to change the trends of the pressure dependences of Meissner signal. This is also evidenced by the fact that different pressure dependences, positive or negative, of the Meissner signal can be revealed for Pr-15 and Sm-55 samples. Hence the above formula can be properly used to make an estimation in present study, which describes that the diamagnetic susceptibility value monotonically decreases when the square of penetration depth increases and vice versa. As it has been mentioned above that the square of penetration depth is inversely proportional to the ratio of superfluid density _n_s to effective mass _m_*, Fig. 3 therefore clearly indicates that the increase or decrease in _T_C is associated with the parallel increase or decrease in _n_s/_m_*. The facts that the _T_C may increase and decrease with pressure[9, 10, 11] suggest that the contribution to the pressure effect should mainly come from _n_s instead of _m_*. We thus propose that the pressure dependences of _T_C shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c) are positively correlated with the variation in the superfluid density under pressure.

It is worth mentioning that _m_SR experiments have revealed that the _T_C of most iron-based superconductors nearly linearly depends on the superfluid density,[24] following the Uemura relation which was first observed in high-temperature cuprate superconductors suggesting the non-BCS feature in the cuprates.[25] This is qualitatively consistent with our results of the iron-based superconductors under pressure. In addition, we also notice that in _s_-wave BCS-type superconductor RbOs\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\), the penetration depth derived from susceptibility measurements is independent of pressure.[26] This is in opposite to our present findings so that it implies that, indeed, iron-based superconductor is more like cuprate superconductors than ordinary BCS ones. Besides, the _T_C of iron-based superconductors is also found correlated with the change in chemical bond and lattice dimension (see, for example, Refs. [27] and [28]), which may be attributed to the pressure effect due to inner chemical pressure associated with chemical composition.

In summary, by diamagnetic susceptibility measurements under pressures on nominal SmFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and PrFe\({}_{0.925}\)Co\({}_{0.075}\)AsO, we have shown the direct correlation between the pressure effects on _T_C's and Meissner signals. Our experiments demonstrate that the variation in superfluid density under pressure is responsible for the different signs of _dT_C/_dP_ observed in each individual sample. The advantage of pressure-dependence study on a given sample is that it excludes the influences of the extrinsic factors on the experimental measurements, such as impurities, disorders, and different doping elements which may vary from sample to sample. The positive correlation between _T_C and superfluid density under pressure distinguishes these iron-based superconductors from the conventional BCS superconductors. However, current study cannot reliably establish the quantitative relationship between _T_C and superfluid density. Further studies are required to pin down the detailed features in the iron-based systems.
