###### Abstract

We present Muon spectroscopy investigations on SmFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\) showing coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity only in a very narrow F-doping range. The sharp crossover between the two types of order is similar to that observed in LaFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\), suggesting a common behavior for the 1111 pnictides. The analysis of the muon asymmetry demonstrates that the coexistence must be nanoscopic, i.e., the two phases must be finely interspersed over a typical length scale of few nm. In this regime both the magnetic and the superconducting transition temperatures collapse to very low values. Our data suggest a competition between the two order parameters.

  fraction. Assuming bulk superconductivity at optimal doping, \(x\) = 0.20, in first approximation the SC fraction is given by the ratio \(v(x)\) = \(\chi(x)/\chi(0.20)\) at low temperature. The ratio remains nearly constant down to \(x\) = 0.10 and it is still large (\(v\) = 0.3) for the sample \(x\) = 0.085, where we expect, however, that the value is underestimated. Indeed, at low doping there is a considerable increase [23] in the field penetration depth \(\lambda_{L}\), which becomes comparable to the grain dimensions (1\(-\)10 \(\mu\)m). The resulting reduction in the Meissner volume of each grain is then reflected in a lower \(\chi(x)\) value and hence in an underestimated SC volume fraction.

For the \(x\) = 0.085 sample the transition [\(T_{c}\) = 14(1) K, extrapolated linearly from the 10\(-\)90 % diamagnetic drop of \(\chi\), which occurs within \(\Delta T\) = 5 K] is rather narrow, much narrower than in samples with comparable \(T_{c}\) reported elsewhere. Since the \(x\) = 0.075 sample shows no bulk superconductivity (Fig. 1), we conclude that the M-SC crossover occurs close to \(x\) = 0.08, at a much lower doping than in previous reports.

Assessing the bulk character of the SC phase is a typical task for TF-\(\mu\)SR. When the sample is field cooled below \(T_{c}\) in a magnetic field \(\mu_{0}\)**_H_** orthogonal to \(\mbox{\boldmath$S$}_{\mu}\), the Abrikosov flux lattice (FL) is formed. The FL produces a distribution of internal fields \(B(\mbox{\boldmath$r$})\) that is uniformly probed by the precessing muons, whose line shape provides the moments of the distribution. [24]

This type of measurement is not possible in the \(x\) = 0.085 sample, where the ZF-\(\mu\)SR response is dominated by the large internal magnetic fields which set in below 22 K, i.e., well before the SC transition [_vide infra_, Fig. 3(d)]. The detection of the FL is however possible for \(x\) \(\geq\) 0.10. The time dependence of the TF asymmetry in the least doped of these samples, \(x\) = 0.10, is shown in the inset of Fig. 2 for two temperatures, above and below the SC transition as detected by SQUID [onset \(T_{c}\) = 41(1) K]. The best fit of the asymmetry data to \(\mbox{$\cal A$}_{T}(t)\) = \(a_{\rm TF}\) exp(\(-\lambda_{T}t\))cos(2 \(\pi\gamma\beta_{\mu}t\)) is also shown, where \(a_{\rm TF}\) is the amplitude and \(\lambda_{T}\) is the relaxation rate. Figure 2 shows the shift of the internal field \(B_{\mu}(T)\) = \(\mu_{0}\)\(H\) as a function of temperature, displaying a clear diamagnetic behavior below \(T_{c}\), in agreement with the SQUID data. This indicates that a large fraction of muons detect a field lower than the applied one, due to the screening of the applied field in the bulk superconductor.

The TF-\(\mu\)SR results confirm the bulk character of superconductivity for \(x\) \(\geq\) 0.10. They support the assumption (\(v\) = 1 for \(x\) = 0.2) that we initially made to estimate the superconducting volume fractions \(v(x)\) from SQUID susceptibility.

We consider now magnetic order, detected by means of ZF-\(\mu\)SR. The left panels in Fig. 3 display the time dependence of the ZF muon asymmetry, \(\mbox{$\cal A$}_{Z}(t)\), for the three samples close to the M-SC phase boundary, \(x\) = 0.075, 0.085, and 0.10 at three different temperatures each. The solid lines show the best fit of the sample asymmetry to the following standard ZF function:

  \[{\cal A}_{Z}(t)=a_{T}\cos(2\,\pi\gamma[\mbox{\boldmath$B$}_{i}]t)e^{-\lambda_{T}t}+ a_{L}G(t),\] (1)

where \(\gamma\)=135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, \(\mbox{\boldmath$B$}_{i}\) is the magnetic field at the muon site, \(\lambda_{T}\) is a relaxation rate, and \(G(t)\) is a non oscillating relaxation function. At the highest temperature shown all three samples are in the paramagnetic regime and \(a_{T}\) vanishes together with \(B_{i}\). By converse, at lower temperatures both the \(x\)=0.075 and the \(x\)=0.085 samples display damped oscillations, due to the presence of internal fields on the order of 100 mT, compatible with a spin-density wave (SDW) ordering of the FeAs layers.[12; 15] The initial direction of the muon spin \(\mbox{\boldmath$S$}_{\mu}\) distinguishes the transverse precessing component (\(a_{T}\),\(\mbox{\boldmath$B$}_{i}\)\(\perp\)\(\mbox{\boldmath$S$}_{\mu}\)) and the longitudinal component (\(a_{L}\),\(\mbox{\boldmath$B$}_{i}\)\(\parallel\)\(\mbox{\boldmath$S$}_{\mu}\)), whose powder-average amplitudes yield a constant sum \(a_{T}\)+\(a_{L}\)=\(a_{Z\!\!R}\). Owing to the large damping, fits with Bessel functions (the expected SDW line shape) yield \(\chi^{2}\) values comparable to those with a cosine fit, precluding the distinction between SDW and simple antiferromagnetic (AF) order. The longitudinal component reveals two contributions, distinguished by largely different relaxation rates, \(a_{L}G(t)\)=\(a_{1}e^{-\lambda_{1}}\)+\(a_{2}e^{-\lambda_{2}}\), up to almost room temperature. They are due to the already mentioned distant diluted ferromagnetic inclusions, observed also by scanning electron microscopy analysis[25] and NMR,[26] with a total volume fraction too small to be detected directly.

Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show the internal field, \(B_{i}\), and the transverse fraction, \(a_{T}\)/\(a_{Z\!\!F}\), as a function of temperature. The simultaneous vanishing of the internal fields \(B_{i}\) and of the transverse amplitudes \(a_{T}\) identify the magnetic transition temperature, \(T_{m}\), which is obtained from a power-law fit, \(B_{i}(T)\)=\(B_{0}(1-T/T_{m})^{\beta}\). If all the muons experience a net internal field \(\mbox{\boldmath$B$}_{i}\), a simple geometric argument predicts \(a_{T}\)/\(a_{Z\!\!F}\) =2/3 for polycrystalline samples and a more accurate determination of \(T_{m}\) is obtained by fitting the transverse component to

\[a_{T}(T)=\frac{a_{T}(0)}{2a_{Z\!\!F}}\left[1-{\rm erf}\left(\frac{T-T_{m}}{ \sqrt{2}\Delta T_{m}}\right)\right],\] (2)

which reproduces a Gaussian distribution of local transition temperatures around the average value \(T_{m}\). The best fit yields \(T_{m}\)=83 and 22 K for \(x\)=0.075 and 0.085 respectively, both with a root mean square (RMS) deviation \(\Delta T_{m}\)=5 K, indicating relatively sharp transitions.

If extensive parts of our \(x\)\(\leq\) 0.085 samples were not magnetically ordered their transverse component would be significantly less than 2/3. This component would also be reduced in the presence of clusters with fluctuating magnetization, such as have been reported in earlier Sm-1111 work[12] (their origin was possibly extrinsic since we definitely could not detect them). Figure 3(e) shows that below \(T_{m}\) our measured transverse component is close to the ideal value of 2/3, demonstrating the presence of static moments throughout the _whole_ volume for both the \(x\)=0.075 and 0.085 samples. These must be Fe static moments since the observed field values of \(\sim\)100 mT is the signature of the ordered Fe sublattice.[11]

The sharp magnetic transitions for \(x\)\(\leq\) 0.085 are also reflected in the critical peak of the transverse relaxation rate \(\lambda_{T}\) as shown in Fig. 3(f) in the case of \(x\)=0.085. This peak is due to the slowing down of the spin fluctuations at \(T_{m}\) (see, e.g., Ref. [27]) and its observation confirms the homogeneity of the F doping. By contrast the additional upturn of \(\lambda_{T}\) below 5 K, visible in all samples but larger in those without Fe order, has already been identified as an exclusive feature of the Sm ordering.[21]

The sample \(x\)=0.085 deserves special attention; although ZF-\(\mu\)SR shows that _all_ implanted muons detect _static_ magnetic order, it displays bulk superconductivity (see Fig. 1). Incidentally susceptibility is unchanged down to 2 K, i.e., superconductivity is not affected by the onset of magnetic order. This remarkable feature is incompatible with _macroscopic_ clusters of SC and M phases, arising for instance from inhomogeneous F doping. Magnetic fields at a distance \(d\) from an antiferromagnetic-type domain (with null macroscopic moment) vanish as \(d^{-3}\) and a rough limit for the detection of a spontaneous internal field is 1 mT. Assuming a Fe magnetic moment of 0.3\(\mu_{B}\),[28] its dipolar field reaches this limit at \(d\)\(\sim\) 1 nm. Therefore SC domains much larger than 1 nm in radius would necessarily imply a distinct measurable muon fraction with vanishing internal fields and a corresponding reduction in the magnetic fraction \(f_{M}\). By contrast, a sizable FC susceptibility and \(f_{M}\)= 1 can arise from interspersed AF and SC clusters of nanoscopic size, reminiscent of what is observed in cuprates[2; 3; 4; 5] and often referred to as _nanoscopic_ coexistence. This dictates a superconducting mean domain size of a few nanometers, compatible with an average coherence length of order \(\xi\)=2 nm.[29] The nanoscopic coexistence and the suppression of the ordering temperatures, a typical finite-size effect, are both indicative of a phase separation with extremely small domains, which suggests a strong competition between the two order parameters.

Moving now on to \(x\)=0.10, best fits always require only relaxing fractions, with two decaying contributions \(a_{\rm slow}\) and \(a_{\rm fast}\). The first has a fairly constant relaxation rate \(\lambda_{\rm slow}\) = 0.2 \(\mu\)s\({}^{-1}\) while the second is temperature dependent. Its rate \(\lambda_{\rm fast}\) [Fig. 3(f)] of course displays the upturn below \(T\) = 5 K, related to Sm ordering.[21] The absence of a simulat

Inset: comparison of our data (solid line) to those of La-1111 from Ref. [11] (dashed line), each rescaled to its nominal crossover concentration \(x_{c}\).

  neous ordering of the Fe moments is however demonstrated by the modest value of this low-temperature rate, that is much less than the Fe-related transverse rate \(\lambda_{T}\) of the \(x\)\(\leq\) 0.085 sample, (see \(x\)=0.085 shown in the same plot). The \(x\)= 0.15 and 0.20 samples exhibit the same moderate rates, corresponding to internal static fields not exceeding few tenths of mT, above 100 K and few mT, just above 5 K. Therefore ZF-\(\mu\)SR consistently rules out any Fe magnetic ordering for \(x\)\(\geq\) 0.10. Incidentally, the decomposition of the ZF-\(\mu\)SR signal into two components, \(a_{\rm slow}\) and \(a_{\rm fast}\), persists up to high temperatures, and is due to static dipolar fields \(B_{d}\) of the order of tenths of mT from the diluted ferromagnetic inclusions, already mentioned. Longitudinal field-dependent \(\mu\)SR confirms the static character of these small fields.

Our results are summarized in the phase diagram of Fig. 4. Electron doping by O-F substitution leads to a sharp drop of \(T_{m}\) around a crossover concentration \(x_{c}\)= 0.085, where the M-SC phase crossover occurs. Similar sharp boundaries in the phase diagram were recently observed by resistivity [30] and nuclear-resonant forward scattering [31] The inset of Fig. 4 compares our data to those of La-1111, [11] each rescaled to its nominal \(x_{c}\) value; the behavior is strikingly similar. In both cases the magnetic order parameter suddenly collapses at \(x_{c}\), and \(T_{c}\) is only slightly dependent on doping. In the Sm sample the coexistence of magnetism with superconductivity is confined to an extremely narrow doping range, virtually pointlike. The inset suggests that such a narrow coexistence region has probably escaped the La experiment, indicating that the two materials behave similarly at the M-SC crossover, both markedly differing from Co-doped 122 compounds. [16] Hence our results indicate that in 1111 materials the type of crossover does not depend on the rare-earth ion, in contrast with earlier reports, [12, 19] which were most likely influenced by a much larger sample inhomogeneity of the samples. [18, 20]

Concluding, our results unify the scenario of the cross-over from magnetic order to superconductivity in R-1111 oxypnictides by offering a more consistent common picture. Thanks to the better chemical homogeneity of our samples we show that the behavior for \(R\)= Sm is compatible with that of the lower \(T_{c}\) systems (\(R\)=La). Both share a sharp crossover, evidence of a strong competition between the two order parameters. The fortunate availability of a homogeneous composition very close to the crossover (\(x\)= 0.085), however, demonstrates a clear instance of nanoscopic coexistence, with reduced order parameters. This specific sample significantly indicates that also oxypnictides are prone to _intrinsic_ phase separation, a feature which is common to many unconventional superconductors.
