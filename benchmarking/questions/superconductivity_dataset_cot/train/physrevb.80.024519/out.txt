2 July 20092004 a larger relative resistivity ratio [RRR = _r_(300 K)/_r_(0 K) ~15] and those without Sn inclusions had a smaller RRR (~5). When both types of samples were subject to pressure, however, characteristic features, such as the structural/antiferromagnetic transition temperature T_{S} and superconducting transition temperature T_{c}, were similar to each other. Below, we report data on single crystals CaFe_{2}As_{2} free of Sn inclusions. Though the ambient-pressure RRR (~5) was small, it increased to greater than 50 at high pressure, indicating intrinsically high crystallinity with few defects.

Figure 1(a) displays the electrical resistivity (r_{b}) of CaFe_{2}As_{2} for electrical current flowing in the Fe-As plane. At ambient pressure, there is a steplike, hysteretic increase in the resistivity at 171 K(=_T__S_), where the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and lattice-structural transitions coincide.[32] When cooled through T_{S}, the high-temperature tetragonal structure switches to an orthorhombic structure and the Fe spin is aligned along the orthorhombic a axis with an ordered moment 0.8 ~\mu_{B}/Fe.[20] Pressure strongly suppresses T_{S} at an initial rate of -220 K/GPa and the transition width broadens. For pressures higher than 0.35 GPa, where neutron-diffraction measurements found a collapsed tetragonal (cT) structure at 0.63 GPa and 50 K,[21] a signature for T_{S} is hardly visible in the resistivity. In this higher pressure range, muon-spin resonance studies show that magnetic order persists to at least 0.62 GPa.[22] On the basis of symmetry, magnetic order with the ambient-pressure propagation wave vector must be associated with the O structure. With further increasing pressure (_P_ > 0.75 GPa), a break in the slope of the resistivity [marked by arrows in Fig. 1(a)] appears, and its temperature _T__S__{S}^{h} increases with increasing pressure, which signals a change to essentially phase-pure cT structure.[23] (We note that experiments using a liquid-helium pressure medium find the low-temperature O-cT boundary at P = 0.35 GPa.[23]) As shown in Fig. 2(a), the transition at T_{S} is strongly hysteretic with temperature, and though not apparent in these figures, the RRR jumps from ~15 to over 50 upon entering the new structural phase.

A slight downturn in the resistivity r_{b} of CaFe_{2}As_{2} is observed below 8 K at ambient pressure [Fig. 1(b)], possibly due to disconnected superconducting filaments. At a pressure of 0.14 GPa, the resistance drops by a factor of 300 at 5.4 K from its value at the superconducting (SC) onset temperature (=11.5 K). With further applied pressure, the resistive transition becomes sharp in a narrow pressure range, and the midpoint temperature T_{c} increases, goes through a maximum near 0.5 GPa and forms a wide pressure dome of _T__c_'s [circles in Fig. 2(b)], consistent with an earlier report from experi

Note the emergence of strong thermal hysteresis at T_{S} in phase III. (b) Temperature-pressure phase diagram. Solid squares (increasing pressure) denote the structural transition temperature T_{S} from a tetragonal to a orthorhombic for P < 0.3 GPa (phase I), a phase of coexisting O and cT structures for 0.3 < P < 0.8 GPa (phase II), and the cT structure (phase III) for P > 0.8 GPa. Open squares represent structural transitions determined with decreasing pressure. The transition temperatures were defined from a break or maximum in the slope of _d__p_/_dT_. Hashed vertical lines separate these structural phases. Circles denote the midpoint of the resistive SC transition and diamonds the onset of superconductivity in ac magnetic susceptibility _khc_. Triangles describe the magnetic transition from a paramagnetic to a SDW phase deduced from _μ_SR measurements (Ref. [22]).

  ments with quasihydrostatic pressure.[18] The existence of superconductivity over a wide pressure range suggests that a specific crystal structure is not a requirement for superconductivity in CaFe_{2}As_{2}, but as will be discussed, this conclusion is not supported by other measurements.

Squares in Fig. 2(b) denote transitions indicated by arrows in Fig. 1(a); whereas, triangles in Fig. 2(b) represent the AFM transition (T_{N}) obtained from \muSR measurements.[22] Below 0.3 GPa, both T_{N} and T_{S} are suppressed at a similar rate under pressure. For pressures higher than 0.3 GPa, where a collapsed tetragonal structure grows in, the two transitions are decoupled: T_{S} is almost independent of pressure but T_{N} drops rapidly to zero kelvin between 0.62 and 1.0 GPa. The T-P phase diagram in Fig. 2(b) shows the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity.

The bulk nature of SC was investigated by ac magnetic susceptibility measurements, with results plotted in Fig. 3(a) for a single crystal sample. At a pressure close to 1 bar, there is no noticeable change in \chi_{\rm ac} (not shown) at low temperatures, which is consistent with other bulk measurements. With pressure, a drop in \chi_{\rm ac} occurs at the resistive midpoint T_{c}. The drop, reflecting the volume shielding fraction of superconductivity, initially increases with pressure, goes through a maximum between 0.4 and 0.6 GPa, and becomes negligible at 1.52 GPa [see Fig. 3(b)]. The change in \chi_{\rm ac} of CaFe_{2}As_{2} at 0.5 GPa is at least 50% of perfect diamagnetism based on measurements in the same coil with known superconductors of similar shape and mass, ruling out filamentary superconductivity for CaFe_{2}As_{2} in this pressure range. A similar diamagnetic response has been reported in superconducting crystals of CaFe_{1.94}Co_{0.06}As_{2}.[33]

Because these low-field (\approx1 Oe) ac susceptibility measurements reflect diamagnetic shielding of the bulk single crystal, these measurements were repeated on crushed crystals that were annealed for 24 h at 300 ^{\circ}C after crushing to remove potential strain induced by grinding them into powder. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the crushed powder was composed of thin (1-2 \mum-thick) platelets but with a distribution of diameters (none larger than 100 \mum in diameter with about 15% of the particles being in each of the ranges 50-80, 30-50, 10-30, and 5-10 \mum and the remaining \approx40% having diameters of 1-5 \mum). Susceptibility measurements on this powder gave the same evolution with pressure and nearly the same diamagnetic response that are shown in Fig. 3(a). The superconducting penetration depth in CaFe_{2}As_{2} is not known but is \approx0.45 \mum in Ba_{0.55}K_{0.45}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [34]) with T_{c}=30 K and close to this value in F-doped LaFeAsO (T_{c}=18 K).[35] With T_{c} in CaFe_{2}As_{2} roughly half that in these other iron arsenide superconductors, we assume its penetration depth is roughly \sqrt{2} larger, i.e., \approx0.6 \mum.[34, 36] Consequently, the ac magnetic field samples of order 60-100 % of the thickness of the crushed crystals and a comparable volume of the large fraction of smallest crystallites. Though still not completely a probe of superconductivity in the bulk, these experiments show that a substantial volume of CaFe_{2}As_{2} supports superconductivity.

Squares in Fig. 3(b) represent the pressure evolution of the paramagnetic volume fraction (the fraction that is not ordered antiferromagnetically) of CaFe_{2}As_{2} estimated independently from \muSR measurements.[22] Neutron-diffraction[37] and NMR measurements[38] are consistent with this estimate being an upper limit on the paramagnetic volume fraction. At 0.4 GPa, the fractional diamagnetic response exceeds the paramagnetic volume fraction of the cT phase, indicating that the pressure-induced superconductivity in CaFe_{2}As_{2} is not from a pure, phase-separated paramagnetic phase, but involves more of the sample volume.

Squares in Fig. 4(a) show the pressure evolution of the residual resistivity (\rho_{0}) of CaFe_{2}As_{2}, which was obtained from a least-squares fit of the low-temperature resistivity to a simple power law, \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}. Values of n(P) range between 2 and 3 (not shown) but \rho_{0} is relatively insensitive to the precise value of n. The residual resistivity displays a sharp change at 0.3 and 0.8 GPa, where O to coexisting O/cT and O/cT to cT structure changes occur, respectively. In the orthorhombic (P<0.3 GPa) and collapsed tetragonal phase (P>0.8 GPa), \rho_{0} monotonically decreases, but the residual resistivity and T_{c} are nonmonotonic, forming a dome around 0.56 GPa in the coexisting phase 0.3<P<0.8 GPa, where the diamagnetic response is a maximum. The deviation from a monotonic decrease in \rho_{0} signifies an additional scattering mechanism at low temperatures.

The existence of structural and magnetic inhomogeneity in phase II is central to the emergence of bulk superconductivity. NMR spectra obtained on CaFe_{2}As_{2} under quasihydro

Figure 3: (Color online) (a) Pressure evolution of normalized ac magnetic susceptibility \Delta\chi_{\rm ac}/\Delta\chi_{\rm ac}(=0.56 GPa) on a single crystal sample, where \Delta\chi_{\rm ac}=\chi_{\rm ac}–\chi_{\rm ac}(T_{c}). In these units, 1.0 corresponds to at least 0.5(1/4 \mur) as explained in the text. The amplitude of the ac magnetic field was approximately 1 Oe. (b) Diamagnetic response -\Delta\chi_{\rm ac}(P)/\Delta\chi_{\rm ac}(0.56 GPa) (circles) at 1.2 K and volume fraction of a paramagnetic phase estimated by \muSR measurements (squares), where the dotted line is an extrapolation (Ref. [22]). Hashed vertical lines are the same as those shown in Fig. 2(b).

  static pressure clearly reflect this inhomogeneity [38] as do stain-gauge measurements shown in Fig. 5. For pressures corresponding to phase I in Fig. 2(b), the strain gauge shows a sharp change in resistance at the structural/magnetic transition temperature. In this pressure range, the pressure medium remains a liquid to just below the structural transition temperature T_{S}. The value of this resistance change at T_{S}\Delta R/R corresponds to a length change \Delta L/L=-0.24%, taking into account the gauge factor of constantan G =2(\Delta L/L\approxG^{-1}\Delta R/R). This length change along the a axis corresponds well that obtained by x-ray diffraction on CaFe_{2}As_{2}. [14] On the other hand, for measurements in phase II, where the freezing temperature of the pressure medium exceeds T_{S}, the length change becomes distributed over a very broad temperature range below the onset of the transition, which implies a wide range of coexisting paramagnetic phase and antiferromagnetic orthorhombic phase. This also is consistent with a microscopic probe of the structure by NMR. [38]

We interpret our observations as follows: at the phase I/phase II boundary, domains of cT phase begin to nucleate in the matrix of magnetic O domains, and the relative fraction of these domains reverses as the phase II/phase III boundary is approached. Though scattering at domain walls could account, in part, for the higher \rho_{0} in phase II relative to phase III, the density of domain walls would need to be nonmonotonic as a function of pressure to account for a maximum in \rho_{0} shown in Fig. 4(a). This seems unlikely. Alternatively, increased scattering in phase II by dynamical processes provides a more plausible interpretation. The qualitatively lower resistivity over a broad temperature range in the pure cT phase implies a higher density of charge carriers than in the O structure, contrary to naive expectations from band structure calculations that find a reduced density of states in the cT structure. [39] These "doped" carriers from the cT phase are scattered by fluctuations associated with the O structure. The origin of these fluctuations could be twofold. In a strong coupling, local-moment picture of the magnetism, magnetic fluctuations are expected as the spin structure of O domains becomes increasingly frustrated due to a pressure-induced increase in As-As and Fe-As hybridization at pressures above 0.3 GPa. [40, 41] On the other hand, in a weak coupling, spin-density-wave (SDW) model, these changes in hybridization also will modify details of Fermi-surface topology and nesting conditions for the SDW, leading to spin fluctuations from nearly nested parts of the Fermi surface. [42] The correlation between an increase in \rho_{0} and T_{c} as well as the maximum in -\Delta\chi_{\rm ac} in phase II is a consequence of the pressure dependence of the volume fraction of O and cT, where the O phase is the necessary source of magnetic fluctuations and the cT phase the source of carriers. The coupled spin-"doped" charge dynamics and bulk superconductivity,

Solid and open symbols are data obtained with increasing pressure, for the same crystal (1) reported in previous figures and for a second crystal (2), respectively. The residual resistivity of (2) was normalized to that of (1) at 1.2 GPa. Hashed vertical lines are the same as those shown in previous figures. (b) Residual resistivity and resistive midpoint T_{c} of crystal (1) (solid symbols) and for (2) (open symbols) obtained on decreasing pressure from 1.52 GPa.

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature-dependent resistance of a constant strain gauge glued along the tetragonal a axis of CaFe_{2}As_{2}. One of nine data points is shown for clarity. The change in resistance is proportional to strain, as discussed in the text. For comparison, the solid line is plot of the temperature-dependent resistance of the free-standing strain gauge at P=0. Measurements are plotted for various increasing pressures, except for the P=0 data that were obtained on decreasing pressure from 0.6 GPa. Note the sharp jump in resistance at the structural transition for P=0 and 0.25 GPa but only a broad peak for pressures corresponding to range II in Fig. 2(b). The inset is a plot of the structural transition temperature determined by these measurements, which are in good agreement with transition temperatures from resistivity measurements.

  present only because of structural inhomogeneity, are absent in pure O and cT structures. Whether or not the domain structure is static or dynamic in phase II cannot be established from these experiments, but expected pressure gradients at O/cT domain walls, due to significant structural differences of the phases, [21] could favor temporal fluctuations of the domains and Fe moments of the O structure. [43] Without a small pressure inhomogeneity inevitable with a soft but frozen pressure medium, it is not possible to nucleate the structural inhomogeneity that induces internal strain, which in turn stabilizes the composite structural phases.

The cT phase depends strongly on pressure history, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Decreasing pressure from highest pressures locks in the low residual resistivity of phase III to a pressure much below 0.8 GPa; there is no maximum in \rho_{0} for 0.3 \leq P \leq 0.8 GPa, and the maximum in -\Delta X_{\rm ac} appears near 0.3 GPa, all in contrast to results on increasing pressure. Recovery of the initial residual resistivity at ambient pressure suggests that the orthorhombic structure is the stable low-temperature structure upon decreasing pressure, as concluded as well in recent structural studies. [37] These conclusions also are consistent with the pressure dependence of T_{S} determined on decreasing pressure [Fig. 2(b)]. The strong pressure hysteresis of the boundary between phases II and III and large thermal hysteresis at T_{S}^{h} will induce structural and electronic inhomogeneities on decreasing pressure and further complicate an interpretation of T_{c}(P) with decreasing pressure.

In summary, pressure-dependent resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements reveal strong coupling among superconductivity, structure, and magnetism in CaFe_{2}As_{2}. The coexisting phase, which exists in a narrow window of increasing pressure, supports bulk superconductivity due to the coupled spin-charge dynamics special to the coexistence.

When both types of samples were subject to pressure, however, characteristic features, such as the structural/antiferromagnetic transition temperature T_{S} and superconducting transition temperature T_{c}, were similar to each other. Below, we report data on single crystals CaFe_{2}As_{2} free of Sn inclusions. Though the ambient-pressure RRR (~5) was small, it increased to greater than 50 at high pressure, indicating intrinsically high crystallinity with few defects.

Figure 1(a) displays the electrical resistivity (r_{b}) of CaFe_{2}As_{2} for electrical current flowing in the Fe-As plane. At ambient pressure, there is a steplike, hysteretic increase in the resistivity at 171 K(=_T__S_), where the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and lattice-structural transitions coincide.[32] When cooled through T_{S}, the high-temperature tetragonal structure switches to an orthorhombic structure and the Fe spin is aligned along the orthorhombic a axis with an ordered moment 0.8 ~\mu_{B}/Fe.[20] Pressure strongly suppresses T_{S} at an initial rate of -220 K/GPa and the transition width broadens. For pressures higher than 0.35 GPa, where neutron-diffraction measurements found a collapsed tetragonal (cT) structure at 0.63 GPa and 50 K,[21] a signature for T_{S} is hardly visible in the resistivity. In this higher pressure range, muon-spin resonance studies show that magnetic order persists to at least 0.62 GPa.[22] On the basis of symmetry, magnetic order with the ambient-pressure propagation wave vector must be associated with the O structure. With further increasing pressure (_P_ > 0.75 GPa), a break in the slope of the resistivity [marked by arrows in Fig. 1(a)] appears, and its temperature _T__S__{S}^{h} increases with increasing pressure, which signals a change to essentially phase-pure cT structure.[23] (We note that experiments using a liquid-helium pressure medium find the low-temperature O-cT boundary at P = 0.35 GPa.[23]) As shown in Fig. 2(a), the transition at T_{S} is strongly hysteretic with temperature, and though not apparent in these figures, the RRR jumps from ~15 to over 50 upon entering the new structural phase.

A slight downturn in the resistivity r_{b} of CaFe_{2}As_{2} is observed below 8 K at ambient pressure [Fig. 1(b)], possibly due to disconnected superconducting filaments. At a pressure of 0.14 GPa, the resistance drops by a factor of 300 at 5.4 K from its value at the superconducting (SC) onset temperature (=11.5 K). With further applied pressure, the resistive transition becomes sharp in a narrow pressure range, and the midpoint temperature T_{c} increases, goes through a maximum near 0.5 GPa and forms a wide pressure dome of _T__c_'s [circles in Fig. 2(b)], consistent with an earlier report from experi

Note the emergence of strong thermal hysteresis at T_{S} in phase III. (b) Temperature-pressure phase diagram. Solid squares (increasing pressure) denote the structural transition temperature T_{S} from a tetragonal to a orthorhombic for P < 0.3 GPa (phase I), a phase of coexisting O and cT structures for 0.3 < P < 0.8 GPa (phase II), and the cT structure (phase III) for P > 0.8 GPa. Open squares represent structural transitions determined with decreasing pressure. The transition temperatures were defined from a break or maximum in the slope of _d__p_/_dT_. Hashed vertical lines separate these structural phases. Circles denote the midpoint of the resistive SC transition and diamonds the onset of superconductivity in ac magnetic susceptibility _khc_. Triangles describe the magnetic transition from a paramagnetic to a SDW phase deduced from _μ_SR measurements (Ref. [22]).

  ments with quasihydrostatic pressure.[18] The existence of superconductivity over a wide pressure range suggests that a specific crystal structure is not a requirement for superconductivity in CaFe_{2}As_{2}, but as will be discussed, this conclusion is not supported by other measurements.

Squares in Fig. 2(b) denote transitions indicated by arrows in Fig. 1(a); whereas, triangles in Fig. 2(b) represent the AFM transition (T_{N}) obtained from \muSR measurements.[22] Below 0.3 GPa, both T_{N} and T_{S} are suppressed at a similar rate under pressure. For pressures higher than 0.3 GPa, where a collapsed tetragonal structure grows in, the two transitions are decoupled: T_{S} is almost independent of pressure but T_{N} drops rapidly to zero kelvin between 0.62 and 1.0 GPa. The T-P phase diagram in Fig. 2(b) shows the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity.

The bulk nature of SC was investigated by ac magnetic susceptibility measurements, with results plotted in Fig. 3(a) for a single crystal sample. At a pressure close to 1 bar, there is no noticeable change in \chi_{\rm ac} (not shown) at low temperatures, which is consistent with other bulk measurements. With pressure, a drop in \chi_{\rm ac} occurs at the resistive midpoint T_{c}. The drop, reflecting the volume shielding fraction of superconductivity, initially increases with pressure, goes through a maximum between 0.4 and 0.6 GPa, and becomes negligible at 1.52 GPa [see Fig. 3(b)]. The change in \chi_{\rm ac} of CaFe_{2}As_{2} at 0.5 GPa is at least 50% of perfect diamagnetism based on measurements in the same coil with known superconductors of similar shape and mass, ruling out filamentary superconductivity for CaFe_{2}As_{2} in this pressure range. A similar diamagnetic response has been reported in superconducting crystals of CaFe_{1.94}Co_{0.06}As_{2}.[33]

Because these low-field (\approx1 Oe) ac susceptibility measurements reflect diamagnetic shielding of the bulk single crystal, these measurements were repeated on crushed crystals that were annealed for 24 h at 300 ^{\circ}C after crushing to remove potential strain induced by grinding them into powder. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the crushed powder was composed of thin (1-2 \mum-thick) platelets but with a distribution of diameters (none larger than 100 \mum in diameter with about 15% of the particles being in each of the ranges 50-80, 30-50, 10-30, and 5-10 \mum and the remaining \approx40% having diameters of 1-5 \mum). Susceptibility measurements on this powder gave the same evolution with pressure and nearly the same diamagnetic response that are shown in Fig. 3(a). The superconducting penetration depth in CaFe_{2}As_{2} is not known but is \approx0.45 \mum in Ba_{0.55}K_{0.45}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [34]) with T_{c}=30 K and close to this value in F-doped LaFeAsO (T_{c}=18 K).[35] With T_{c} in CaFe_{2}As_{2} roughly half that in these other iron arsenide superconductors, we assume its penetration depth is roughly \sqrt{2} larger, i.e., \approx0.6 \mum.[34, 36] Consequently, the ac magnetic field samples of order 60-100 % of the thickness of the crushed crystals and a comparable volume of the large fraction of smallest crystallites. Though still not completely a probe of superconductivity in the bulk, these experiments show that a substantial volume of CaFe_{2}As_{2} supports superconductivity.

Squares in Fig. 3(b) represent the pressure evolution of the paramagnetic volume fraction (the fraction that is not ordered antiferromagnetically) of CaFe_{2}As_{2} estimated independently from \muSR measurements.[22] Neutron-diffraction[37] and NMR measurements[38] are consistent with this estimate being an upper limit on the paramagnetic volume fraction. At 0.4 GPa, the fractional diamagnetic response exceeds the paramagnetic volume fraction of the cT phase, indicating that the pressure-induced superconductivity in CaFe_{2}As_{2} is not from a pure, phase-separated paramagnetic phase, but involves more of the sample volume.

Squares in Fig. 4(a) show the pressure evolution of the residual resistivity (\rho_{0}) of CaFe_{2}As_{2}, which was obtained from a least-squares fit of the low-temperature resistivity to a simple power law, \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}. Values of n(P) range between 2 and 3 (not shown) but \rho_{0} is relatively insensitive to the precise value of n. The residual resistivity displays a sharp change at 0.3 and 0.8 GPa, where O to coexisting O/cT and O/cT to cT structure changes occur, respectively. In the orthorhombic (P<0.3 GPa) and collapsed tetragonal phase (P>0.8 GPa), \rho_{0} monotonically decreases, but the residual resistivity and T_{c} are nonmonotonic, forming a dome around 0.56 GPa in the coexisting phase 0.3<P<0.8 GPa, where the diamagnetic response is a maximum. The deviation from a monotonic decrease in \rho_{0} signifies an additional scattering mechanism at low temperatures.

The existence of structural and magnetic inhomogeneity in phase II is central to the emergence of bulk superconductivity. NMR spectra obtained on CaFe_{2}As_{2} under quasihydro

In these units, 1.0 corresponds to at least 0.5(1/4 \mur) as explained in the text. The amplitude of the ac magnetic field was approximately 1 Oe. (b) Diamagnetic response -\Delta\chi_{\rm ac}(P)/\Delta\chi_{\rm ac}(0.56 GPa) (circles) at 1.2 K and volume fraction of a paramagnetic phase estimated by \muSR measurements (squares), where the dotted line is an extrapolation (Ref. [22]). Hashed vertical lines are the same as those shown in Fig. 2(b).

  static pressure clearly reflect this inhomogeneity [38] as do stain-gauge measurements shown in Fig. 5. For pressures corresponding to phase I in Fig. 2(b), the strain gauge shows a sharp change in resistance at the structural/magnetic transition temperature. In this pressure range, the pressure medium remains a liquid to just below the structural transition temperature T_{S}. The value of this resistance change at T_{S}\Delta R/R corresponds to a length change \Delta L/L=-0.24%, taking into account the gauge factor of constantan G =2(\Delta L/L\approxG^{-1}\Delta R/R). This length change along the a axis corresponds well that obtained by x-ray diffraction on CaFe_{2}As_{2}. [14] On the other hand, for measurements in phase II, where the freezing temperature of the pressure medium exceeds T_{S}, the length change becomes distributed over a very broad temperature range below the onset of the transition, which implies a wide range of coexisting paramagnetic phase and antiferromagnetic orthorhombic phase. This also is consistent with a microscopic probe of the structure by NMR. [38]

We interpret our observations as follows: at the phase I/phase II boundary, domains of cT phase begin to nucleate in the matrix of magnetic O domains, and the relative fraction of these domains reverses as the phase II/phase III boundary is approached. Though scattering at domain walls could account, in part, for the higher \rho_{0} in phase II relative to phase III, the density of domain walls would need to be nonmonotonic as a function of pressure to account for a maximum in \rho_{0} shown in Fig. 4(a). This seems unlikely. Alternatively, increased scattering in phase II by dynamical processes provides a more plausible interpretation. The qualitatively lower resistivity over a broad temperature range in the pure cT phase implies a higher density of charge carriers than in the O structure, contrary to naive expectations from band structure calculations that find a reduced density of states in the cT structure. [39] These "doped" carriers from the cT phase are scattered by fluctuations associated with the O structure. The origin of these fluctuations could be twofold. In a strong coupling, local-moment picture of the magnetism, magnetic fluctuations are expected as the spin structure of O domains becomes increasingly frustrated due to a pressure-induced increase in As-As and Fe-As hybridization at pressures above 0.3 GPa. [40, 41] On the other hand, in a weak coupling, spin-density-wave (SDW) model, these changes in hybridization also will modify details of Fermi-surface topology and nesting conditions for the SDW, leading to spin fluctuations from nearly nested parts of the Fermi surface. [42] The correlation between an increase in \rho_{0} and T_{c} as well as the maximum in -\Delta\chi_{\rm ac} in phase II is a consequence of the pressure dependence of the volume fraction of O and cT, where the O phase is the necessary source of magnetic fluctuations and the cT phase the source of carriers. The coupled spin-"doped" charge dynamics and bulk superconductivity,

Solid and open symbols are data obtained with increasing pressure, for the same crystal (1) reported in previous figures and for a second crystal (2), respectively. The residual resistivity of (2) was normalized to that of (1) at 1.2 GPa. Hashed vertical lines are the same as those shown in previous figures. (b) Residual resistivity and resistive midpoint T_{c} of crystal (1) (solid symbols) and for (2) (open symbols) obtained on decreasing pressure from 1.52 GPa.

Figure 5: (Color online) Temperature-dependent resistance of a constant strain gauge glued along the tetragonal a axis of CaFe_{2}As_{2}. One of nine data points is shown for clarity. The change in resistance is proportional to strain, as discussed in the text. For comparison, the solid line is plot of the temperature-dependent resistance of the free-standing strain gauge at P=0. Measurements are plotted for various increasing pressures, except for the P=0 data that were obtained on decreasing pressure from 0.6 GPa. Note the sharp jump in resistance at the structural transition for P=0 and 0.25 GPa but only a broad peak for pressures corresponding to range II in Fig. 2(b). The inset is a plot of the structural transition temperature determined by these measurements, which are in good agreement with transition temperatures from resistivity measurements.

  present only because of structural inhomogeneity, are absent in pure O and cT structures. Whether or not the domain structure is static or dynamic in phase II cannot be established from these experiments, but expected pressure gradients at O/cT domain walls, due to significant structural differences of the phases, [21] could favor temporal fluctuations of the domains and Fe moments of the O structure. [43] Without a small pressure inhomogeneity inevitable with a soft but frozen pressure medium, it is not possible to nucleate the structural inhomogeneity that induces internal strain, which in turn stabilizes the composite structural phases.

The cT phase depends strongly on pressure history, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Decreasing pressure from highest pressures locks in the low residual resistivity of phase III to a pressure much below 0.8 GPa; there is no maximum in \rho_{0} for 0.3 \leq P \leq 0.8 GPa, and the maximum in -\Delta X_{\rm ac} appears near 0.3 GPa, all in contrast to results on increasing pressure. Recovery of the initial residual resistivity at ambient pressure suggests that the orthorhombic structure is the stable low-temperature structure upon decreasing pressure, as concluded as well in recent structural studies. [37] These conclusions also are consistent with the pressure dependence of T_{S} determined on decreasing pressure [Fig. 2(b)]. The strong pressure hysteresis of the boundary between phases II and III and large thermal hysteresis at T_{S}^{h} will induce structural and electronic inhomogeneities on decreasing pressure and further complicate an interpretation of T_{c}(P) with decreasing pressure.

In summary, pressure-dependent resistivity and ac susceptibility measurements reveal strong coupling among superconductivity, structure, and magnetism in CaFe_{2}As_{2}. The coexisting phase, which exists in a narrow window of increasing pressure, supports bulk superconductivity due to the coupled spin-charge dynamics special to the coexistence.
