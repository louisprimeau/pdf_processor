###### Abstract

We measured the surface impedance of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} single crystals at 10 GHz in two kinds of magnetic-field configurations (H_{u}\parallel_c_,H_{u}\perp_c_). We investigated the temperature dependence of the c-axis microwave conductivity \sigma_{1}^{c} in the superconducting state for a fully oxygenated sample (T_{c}= 93 K) and two oxygen-reduced samples (T_{c}= 65 K, 63 K). In the oxygen-reduced sample, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) shows a broad peak similar to that of \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T), while in the oxygen-reduced samples \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) shows quite different dependence on temperature from \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T). Namely, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in the superconducting state strongly depends on the oxygen content in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. The result suggests that the dynamics of the quasiparticles in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} keeps a strong two-dimensional nature in the superconducting state.

High-T_{c} cuprates have the layered structure of CuO_{2} planes. The charge dynamics in the CuO_{2} planes (a-b planes) has been extensively investigated, while the nature of c-axis (\perp CuO_{2} plane) charge dynamics has not been studied enough. In the normal state, dc-resistivity [1] and optical [2] measurements have revealed that the c-axis charge dynamics is "metallic" in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (T_{c}\sim 90 K) but "semiconductor" in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (T_{c}\sim 60 K). In the superconducting state, a recent optical measurement [3] has reported that the c-axis optical conductivity in oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is different from that in fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} at the lower frequency region. Information on the charge dynamics at energies below the optical region is obtained from microwave surface impedance measurements, which are more suitable for obtaining the temperature dependence of the penetration depth, ac conductivity, and quasiparticle scattering rate [4, 5]. However, experiments on the surface impedance measurement have been concentrated on the properties in the CuO_{2} planes [4, 5], except for a recent investigation of the anisotropic penetration depth in large La_{2-x} Sr_{x}CuO_{4} crystals [6].

In this paper, we present the temperature dependence of the c-axis microwave conductivity \sigma_{1}^{c} as well as the in-plane conductivity \sigma_{1}^{ab} on a fully oxygenated sample and two oxygen-reduced samples of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. We find that the behavior of \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T) is basically similar among samples with different oxygen content. On the other hand, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) is found to change dramatically with the oxygen content. We report the systematic change of \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in the microwave region as a function of the hole concentration. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the quasiparticles in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} keeps a strong two-dimensional nature even in the superconducting state.

Single crystals of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, which are thick enough to measure the anisotropy of the surface impedance, were grown using techniques described elsewhere [7]. The dimensions and superconducting properties of the three measured samples are listed in Table 1. The fully oxygenated sample (sample A) shows low resistivity (\rho^{ab}\simeq 40 \mu\Omega cm just above T_{c}). [7] Two oxygen-reduced samples (samples B and C) are obtained from the usual quenching technique [8]. The values of T_{c} (see Table 1) and c-axis lattice parameters (11.72 and 11.73 A for samples B and C, respectively) indicate that the oxygen content in sample C is smaller than that of sample B.

The surface impedance (Z_{s}=R_{s}+iX_{s}) was measured at 10 GHz using a superconducting Pb cavity resonator [5] with a heated sapphire rod inside. High quality factor Q (\sim 1\times 10^{6}) of the cavity enables stable resonance (\delta f/< 10^{-8}). The microwave magnetic field H_{u} is parallel

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} Sample & Dimensions (mm^{3}) & T_{c} (K) & R_{s}^{ab} (\Omega) & R_{s}^{c} (\Omega) & \lambda^{ab} (\mum) & \lambda^{c} (\mum) \\ A & 2.0\times1.2\times0.8 & 93 & 0.12 & 1.8 & 0.14 & 0.9 \\ B & 0.9\times0.8\times0.9 & 65 & 0.17 & 14 & 0.28 & 12 \\ C  to the axis of the rod on which the sample is mounted. Then the screening current flows around the four faces of the sample which are parallel to H_{\omega}, in the region with the thickness of the classical skin depth \delta_{\rm d} above T_{c} or the penetration depth \lambda below T_{c} from the sample surface. In the cavity perturbation technique, the surface resistance R_{s} is obtained from the formula R_{s}\!=\!G_{1}(Q^{-1}\!-\!Q^{-1}_{\rm blank}), and the change in the surface reactance \Delta X_{s} is obtained from \Delta X_{s}\!=\!-G_{2}\Delta f/f, where G_{1} and G_{2} are the geometrical factors determined experimentally by using a reference sample. Q_{\rm blank} is the Q of the cavity without a sample, and \Delta X_{s} is the change of X_{s}. The absolute value of X_{s} is determined by the relation R_{s}\!=\!X_{s}\!=\!\sqrt{\mu_{0}\omega\rho/2}, which is valid in the normal state in the microwave region. [9]

In order to investigate the anisotropy of Z_{s}, the measurements were performed for each sample in two kinds of magnetic-field configurations (H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c,\!H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c). In the configuration of H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c, the screening current flows only in the CuO_{2} planes, and the surface impedance obtained from this configuration is Z_{s}^{ab}, namely,

\[Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c}\!=\!Z_{s}^{ab}\,.\] (1)

The superscript (ab or c) of Z_{s} expresses the direction of the screening current. We neglected the anisotropy in the CuO_{2} plane because we used twinned crystals. On the other hand, in the configuration of H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c, Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c} is described as the geometrical mean value of Z_{s}^{ab} and Z_{s}^{c} by

\[Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c}\!=\!\frac{S^{ab}Z_{s}^{ab}+S^{c}Z_{s}^{c}}{S^{ab} \!+\!S^{c}}\,.\] (2)

S^{ab} and S^{c} are the areas of the faces where the screening current flows in the CuO_{2} plane and along the c direction, respectively. In this approximation, we neglect the bending effect of the electromagnetic field at the edges of a sample, but the experimental results show that the application of Eq. (2) is valid in this system, as described below. From the measured Z_{s} in the configurations of H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c and H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c, we can obtain Z_{s}^{c} using Eq. (1) as

\[Z_{s}^{c}\!=\!(1\!+\!L^{ab}/L^{c})Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c}\!-\!(L^{ab}/L^{ c})Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c}\,,\] (3)

where L^{c} and L^{ab} are the sample dimensions in the c direction and the a-b direction, respectively (see the inset of Fig. 1).

The microwave complex conductivity (\sigma\!=\!\sigma_{1}\!-\!i\sigma_{2}) is related to the surface impedance by the formula [10]

\[Z_{s}\!=\!\sqrt{i\,\mu_{0}\omega/\sigma},\] (4)

in the local electrodynamics regime. [11]

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the surface impedance for sample A (T_{c}\!=\!93 K) and sample B (T_{c}\!=\!65 K). In the normal state, we can estimate the value of the resistivity \rho from the surface resistance (\rho\!=\!2R_{s}^{2}/\mu_{0}\omega). The estimation just above T_{c} is \rho^{ab}\!=\!38\mu\Omega cm and \rho^{c}\!=\!9\mu\Omega cm for sample A, consistent with the published values of fully oxygenated crystals. [7] In the superconducting state, the penetration depth \lambda is obtained from the surface reactance (\lambda\!=\!X_{s}/\mu_{0}\omega). The values of the penetration depth at the lowest temperature in the fully oxygenated sample are 0.14 \mum for \lambda^{ab}, 0.9 \mum for \lambda^{c}, which are also consistent with the published values. [12] Therefore, the obtained values of both R_{s} above T_{c} and \lambda below T_{c} guarantee the accuracy of the extracted values of Z_{s}^{c} using Eq. (3). For the oxygen-reduced samples (B and C), larger anisotropy of Z_{s} is observed (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). In sample C, the contribution of Z_{s}^{ab} to Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c} is negligible because of the large anisotropy.

In Fig. 2, we show the temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity \sigma_{1} normalized to the value at T_{c} , which is obtained from Z_{s} using Eq. (4). The narrow peak visible near T_{c} in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) may be regarded as an artificial peak arising from the width of the superconducting transition, [5, 13] although another interpretation for the origin of this peak exists. [14] In any case we are interested here in the temperature dependence of the conductivity away from T_{c} , and the existence of this narrow peak does not affect our conclusions in this paper.

First, for \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T), we can find a common structure in the temperature dependence of \sigma_{1}^{ab} as in Fig. 2(b). Both \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T) of samples A and B show a similar broad peak at low temperatures as that reported in Refs. [4, 5], and [15]. The origin of this structure is interpreted as the suppression of the inelastic scattering of quasiparticles in the CuO_{2} planes. [4, 5, 15] The appearance of the broad peak structure in all _in-plane_ conductivities of fully oxygenated, oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\gamma} (Ref. [5]) clearly indicates that the suppression of the quasiparticle damping in the superconducting state is a common feature in the CuO_{2} planes of high-T_{c} cuprates. To see more carefully, the height and the

  position of the broad peak are different among three samples. This difference may be due to the slight difference in the temperature dependence of the scattering rate below T_{c} between these samples, which will be discussed in a future publication.[17]

In contrast to \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T), a drastic difference was found in \sigma_{1}^{c}(\sigma) among samples A, B, and C, as shown in Fig. 2(a). \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) of sample A rapidly increases below T_{c} and has a broad peak structure at lower temperatures. The maximum value, near 0.4T_{c} , is about 70 times as large as \sigma_{1}^{c}(T_{c}). In sample A the magnitudes of \sigma_{1}^{c} and \sigma_{1}^{ab} are anisotropic (factor of 100 at T_{c}), but the temperature dependences are similar. It should be noted again that the temperature dependence of the c-axis dc conductivity in the normal state is exceptionally high and metallic in fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[1] The fact that \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) of sample A also shows a broad peak suggests that the inelastic scattering of quasiparticles is suppressed along the c direction as well as in the CuO_{2} plane in the superconducting state, as discussed below. On the other hand, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) of samples B and C does not show such a rapid increase, and still remains at the low level below T_{c} [see Fig. 2(a)]. In particular, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in sample C decreases rather rapidly below T_{c} , which is in sharp contrast to \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in the fully oxygenated sample. Thus, it is found that the temperature dependence of \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) strongly depends on the content of oxygen in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.

The strong dependence of the quasiparticle dynamics along the c direction on the oxygen content in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is also seen in the recent optical conductivity measurements[3, 16] in the superconducting state. Schutzmann _et al.[16]_ recently observed a Drude-like structure in the optical \sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega) of a fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} crystal. On the other hand, Homes _et al.[3]_ have reported that the optical conductivity \sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega) at 10 K in an oxygen-reduced sample of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.70} has small values down to the lowest frequency. These reports of the c-axis optical conductivity are qualitatively consistent with our microwave result of \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. The low c-axis conductivity below T_{c} in the oxygen-deficient samples demonstrates that the quasiparticles are nearly confined in the CuO_{2} planes in those samples.

We extracted the quasiparticle damping 1/\tau(T) from \sigma_{1}(T) by applying the generalized two-fluid model analysis,[51, 33] as in Fig. 3. 1/\tau(T) of the fully oxygenated sample rapidly decreases below T_{c} along the c direction as well as in the CuO_{2} plane. Note that 1/\tau(T) is drawn in a log scale in Fig. 3. At the lowest temperature, 1/\tau^{ab}(T) decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude, and the magnitude and the temperature dependence of 1/\tau^{ab}(T) correspond well to the result in Ref. [13]. We find that 1/\tau^{c}(T) has the same order of magnitude as 1/\tau^{ab}(T) at low temperatures. This result implies that the inelastic scattering of quasiparticles in fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} becomes isotropic in the superconducting state.

The situation is, however, quite different in the oxygen-deficient samples. As in the inset of Fig. 3, 1/\tau^{ab}(T) of sample B shows a similar rapid decrease as that of sample A. On the other hand, 1/\tau^{c}(T) of sample B only decreases by one-fourth of the value at T_{c} at the lowest temperature, and a rapid _increase_ is observed in 1/\tau^{c}(T) of sample C. This striking behavior of 1/\tau^{c}(T) in samples B and C results from the application of the generalized two-fluid analysis. In the generalized two-fluid model, the normal fluid conductivity is described by Drude theory.[5, 13] In this picture the quasiparticles in the low-energy region are itinerant, which was shown to be incorrect by optical and by the present microwave experiments. In order to extract true 1/\tau^{c}(T) in the oxygen

  reduced samples, we need a more careful analysis.

The recent systematic investigation of the anisotropic penetration depth \lambda in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} claimed that the response of the superfluid can be regarded two-dimensional in the superconducting state,[6] and concluded that \lambda^{c} is determined by the intrinsic Josephson current across the CuO_{2} planes. The observed large anisotropy of the penetration depth in oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (see Table 1) implies that the supercurrent along the c axis in this system is also characterized by a Josephson-like coupling mechanism.[17] In other words, \lambda^{c} in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} may be determined by Josephson current flowing between the CuO_{2} bilayers. Therefore, together with the above presented results on the c-axis conductivity, we conclude that the charge dynamics of both superfluids and quasiparticles in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} has a strong two-dimensional nature in the superconducting state. The strong two-dimensional nature in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is also observed in the resistivity[1] and optical conductivity[2] measurements in the normal state. Then, one can say that the large anisotropy in the charge dynamics (or the strong confinement of charges in CuO_{2} layers) in the normal state remains valid even in the superconducting state.

For the fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, we have observed exceptionally high \sigma_{1}^{c} below T_{c}. One possible explanation is the effect of the insertion of the CuO conducting chain into the superconducting layers. It has been pointed out that the CuO chains inserted between CuO_{2} planes contribute to the normal-state conduction along the c direction.[1, 2] However, the present results may also come from the intrinsic change in the high-T_{c} superconductivity as a function of the hole concentration. More detailed investigation is needed for other optimal- and over-doped materials.

In conclusion, we have measured the microwave conductivity perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes as a function of temperature in the fully oxygenated and oxygen-reduced crystals of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. The c-axis \sigma_{1}(T) in the fully oxygenated sample shows a broad peak similar to the in-plane \sigma_{1}(T), suggesting exceptionally isotropic scattering in the superconducting state. In contrast, for the oxygen-reduced samples \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) remains at low level and shows no drastic enhancement below T_{c}. The results imply the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the CuO_{2} planes even in the superconducting state.

###### Abstract

We measured the surface impedance of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} single crystals at 10 GHz in two kinds of magnetic-field configurations (H_{u}\parallel_c_,H_{u}\perp_c_). We investigated the temperature dependence of the c-axis microwave conductivity \sigma_{1}^{c} in the superconducting state for a fully oxygenated sample (T_{c}= 93 K) and two oxygen-reduced samples (T_{c}= 65 K, 63 K). In the oxygen-reduced sample, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) shows a broad peak similar to that of \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T), while in the oxygen-reduced samples \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) shows quite different dependence on temperature from \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T). Namely, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in the superconducting state strongly depends on the oxygen content in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. The result suggests that the dynamics of the quasiparticles in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} keeps a strong two-dimensional nature in the superconducting state.

High-T_{c} cuprates have the layered structure of CuO_{2} planes. The charge dynamics in the CuO_{2} planes (a-b planes) has been extensively investigated, while the nature of c-axis (\perp CuO_{2} plane) charge dynamics has not been studied enough. In the normal state, dc-resistivity [1] and optical [2] measurements have revealed that the c-axis charge dynamics is "metallic" in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (T_{c}\sim 90 K) but "semiconductor" in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (T_{c}\sim 60 K). In the superconducting state, a recent optical measurement [3] has reported that the c-axis optical conductivity in oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is different from that in fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} at the lower frequency region. Information on the charge dynamics at energies below the optical region is obtained from microwave surface impedance measurements, which are more suitable for obtaining the temperature dependence of the penetration depth, ac conductivity, and quasiparticle scattering rate [4, 5]. However, experiments on the surface impedance measurement have been concentrated on the properties in the CuO_{2} planes [4, 5], except for a recent investigation of the anisotropic penetration depth in large La_{2-x} Sr_{x}CuO_{4} crystals [6].

In this paper, we present the temperature dependence of the c-axis microwave conductivity \sigma_{1}^{c} as well as the in-plane conductivity \sigma_{1}^{ab} on a fully oxygenated sample and two oxygen-reduced samples of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. We find that the behavior of \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T) is basically similar among samples with different oxygen content. On the other hand, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) is found to change dramatically with the oxygen content. We report the systematic change of \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in the microwave region as a function of the hole concentration. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the quasiparticles in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} keeps a strong two-dimensional nature even in the superconducting state.

Single crystals of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, which are thick enough to measure the anisotropy of the surface impedance, were grown using techniques described elsewhere [7]. The dimensions and superconducting properties of the three measured samples are listed in Table 1. The fully oxygenated sample (sample A) shows low resistivity (\rho^{ab}\simeq 40 \mu\Omega cm just above T_{c}). [7] Two oxygen-reduced samples (samples B and C) are obtained from the usual quenching technique [8]. The values of T_{c} (see Table 1) and c-axis lattice parameters (11.72 and 11.73 A for samples B and C, respectively) indicate that the oxygen content in sample C is smaller than that of sample B.

The surface impedance (Z_{s}=R_{s}+iX_{s}) was measured at 10 GHz using a superconducting Pb cavity resonator [5] with a heated sapphire rod inside. High quality factor Q (\sim 1\times 10^{6}) of the cavity enables stable resonance (\delta f/< 10^{-8}). The microwave magnetic field H_{u} is parallel

Then the screening current flows around the four faces of the sample which are parallel to H_{\omega}, in the region with the thickness of the classical skin depth \delta_{\rm d} above T_{c} or the penetration depth \lambda below T_{c} from the sample surface. In the cavity perturbation technique, the surface resistance R_{s} is obtained from the formula R_{s}\!=\!G_{1}(Q^{-1}\!-\!Q^{-1}_{\rm blank}), and the change in the surface reactance \Delta X_{s} is obtained from \Delta X_{s}\!=\!-G_{2}\Delta f/f, where G_{1} and G_{2} are the geometrical factors determined experimentally by using a reference sample. Q_{\rm blank} is the Q of the cavity without a sample, and \Delta X_{s} is the change of X_{s}. The absolute value of X_{s} is determined by the relation R_{s}\!=\!X_{s}\!=\!\sqrt{\mu_{0}\omega\rho/2}, which is valid in the normal state in the microwave region. [9]

In order to investigate the anisotropy of Z_{s}, the measurements were performed for each sample in two kinds of magnetic-field configurations (H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c,\!H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c). In the configuration of H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c, the screening current flows only in the CuO_{2} planes, and the surface impedance obtained from this configuration is Z_{s}^{ab}, namely,

\[Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c}\!=\!Z_{s}^{ab}\,.\] (1)

The superscript (ab or c) of Z_{s} expresses the direction of the screening current. We neglected the anisotropy in the CuO_{2} plane because we used twinned crystals. On the other hand, in the configuration of H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c, Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c} is described as the geometrical mean value of Z_{s}^{ab} and Z_{s}^{c} by

\[Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c}\!=\!\frac{S^{ab}Z_{s}^{ab}+S^{c}Z_{s}^{c}}{S^{ab} \!+\!S^{c}}\,.\] (2)

S^{ab} and S^{c} are the areas of the faces where the screening current flows in the CuO_{2} plane and along the c direction, respectively. In this approximation, we neglect the bending effect of the electromagnetic field at the edges of a sample, but the experimental results show that the application of Eq. (2) is valid in this system, as described below. From the measured Z_{s} in the configurations of H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c and H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c, we can obtain Z_{s}^{c} using Eq. (1) as

\[Z_{s}^{c}\!=\!(1\!+\!L^{ab}/L^{c})Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c}\!-\!(L^{ab}/L^{ c})Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\parallel\!c}\,,\] (3)

where L^{c} and L^{ab} are the sample dimensions in the c direction and the a-b direction, respectively (see the inset of Fig. 1).

The microwave complex conductivity (\sigma\!=\!\sigma_{1}\!-\!i\sigma_{2}) is related to the surface impedance by the formula [10]

\[Z_{s}\!=\!\sqrt{i\,\mu_{0}\omega/\sigma},\] (4)

in the local electrodynamics regime. [11]

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the surface impedance for sample A (T_{c}\!=\!93 K) and sample B (T_{c}\!=\!65 K). In the normal state, we can estimate the value of the resistivity \rho from the surface resistance (\rho\!=\!2R_{s}^{2}/\mu_{0}\omega). The estimation just above T_{c} is \rho^{ab}\!=\!38\mu\Omega cm and \rho^{c}\!=\!9\mu\Omega cm for sample A, consistent with the published values of fully oxygenated crystals. [7] In the superconducting state, the penetration depth \lambda is obtained from the surface reactance (\lambda\!=\!X_{s}/\mu_{0}\omega). The values of the penetration depth at the lowest temperature in the fully oxygenated sample are 0.14 \mum for \lambda^{ab}, 0.9 \mum for \lambda^{c}, which are also consistent with the published values. [12] Therefore, the obtained values of both R_{s} above T_{c} and \lambda below T_{c} guarantee the accuracy of the extracted values of Z_{s}^{c} using Eq. (3). For the oxygen-reduced samples (B and C), larger anisotropy of Z_{s} is observed (see Fig. 1 and Table 1). In sample C, the contribution of Z_{s}^{ab} to Z_{s}^{H_{\omega}\!\perp\!c} is negligible because of the large anisotropy.

In Fig. 2, we show the temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity \sigma_{1} normalized to the value at T_{c} , which is obtained from Z_{s} using Eq. (4). The narrow peak visible near T_{c} in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) may be regarded as an artificial peak arising from the width of the superconducting transition, [5, 13] although another interpretation for the origin of this peak exists. [14] In any case we are interested here in the temperature dependence of the conductivity away from T_{c} , and the existence of this narrow peak does not affect our conclusions in this paper.

First, for \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T), we can find a common structure in the temperature dependence of \sigma_{1}^{ab} as in Fig. 2(b). Both \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T) of samples A and B show a similar broad peak at low temperatures as that reported in Refs. [4, 5], and [15]. The origin of this structure is interpreted as the suppression of the inelastic scattering of quasiparticles in the CuO_{2} planes. [4, 5, 15] The appearance of the broad peak structure in all _in-plane_ conductivities of fully oxygenated, oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\gamma} (Ref. [5]) clearly indicates that the suppression of the quasiparticle damping in the superconducting state is a common feature in the CuO_{2} planes of high-T_{c} cuprates. To see more carefully, the height and the

  position of the broad peak are different among three samples. This difference may be due to the slight difference in the temperature dependence of the scattering rate below T_{c} between these samples, which will be discussed in a future publication.[17]

In contrast to \sigma_{1}^{ab}(T), a drastic difference was found in \sigma_{1}^{c}(\sigma) among samples A, B, and C, as shown in Fig. 2(a). \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) of sample A rapidly increases below T_{c} and has a broad peak structure at lower temperatures. The maximum value, near 0.4T_{c} , is about 70 times as large as \sigma_{1}^{c}(T_{c}). In sample A the magnitudes of \sigma_{1}^{c} and \sigma_{1}^{ab} are anisotropic (factor of 100 at T_{c}), but the temperature dependences are similar. It should be noted again that the temperature dependence of the c-axis dc conductivity in the normal state is exceptionally high and metallic in fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}.[1] The fact that \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) of sample A also shows a broad peak suggests that the inelastic scattering of quasiparticles is suppressed along the c direction as well as in the CuO_{2} plane in the superconducting state, as discussed below. On the other hand, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) of samples B and C does not show such a rapid increase, and still remains at the low level below T_{c} [see Fig. 2(a)]. In particular, \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in sample C decreases rather rapidly below T_{c} , which is in sharp contrast to \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in the fully oxygenated sample. Thus, it is found that the temperature dependence of \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) strongly depends on the content of oxygen in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.

The strong dependence of the quasiparticle dynamics along the c direction on the oxygen content in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} is also seen in the recent optical conductivity measurements[3, 16] in the superconducting state. Schutzmann _et al.[16]_ recently observed a Drude-like structure in the optical \sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega) of a fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} crystal. On the other hand, Homes _et al.[3]_ have reported that the optical conductivity \sigma_{1}^{c}(\omega) at 10 K in an oxygen-reduced sample of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6.70} has small values down to the lowest frequency. These reports of the c-axis optical conductivity are qualitatively consistent with our microwave result of \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. The low c-axis conductivity below T_{c} in the oxygen-deficient samples demonstrates that the quasiparticles are nearly confined in the CuO_{2} planes in those samples.

We extracted the quasiparticle damping 1/\tau(T) from \sigma_{1}(T) by applying the generalized two-fluid model analysis,[51, 33] as in Fig. 3. 1/\tau(T) of the fully oxygenated sample rapidly decreases below T_{c} along the c direction as well as in the CuO_{2} plane. Note that 1/\tau(T) is drawn in a log scale in Fig. 3. At the lowest temperature, 1/\tau^{ab}(T) decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude, and the magnitude and the temperature dependence of 1/\tau^{ab}(T) correspond well to the result in Ref. [13]. We find that 1/\tau^{c}(T) has the same order of magnitude as 1/\tau^{ab}(T) at low temperatures. This result implies that the inelastic scattering of quasiparticles in fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} becomes isotropic in the superconducting state.

The situation is, however, quite different in the oxygen-deficient samples. As in the inset of Fig. 3, 1/\tau^{ab}(T) of sample B shows a similar rapid decrease as that of sample A. On the other hand, 1/\tau^{c}(T) of sample B only decreases by one-fourth of the value at T_{c} at the lowest temperature, and a rapid _increase_ is observed in 1/\tau^{c}(T) of sample C. This striking behavior of 1/\tau^{c}(T) in samples B and C results from the application of the generalized two-fluid analysis. In the generalized two-fluid model, the normal fluid conductivity is described by Drude theory.[5, 13] In this picture the quasiparticles in the low-energy region are itinerant, which was shown to be incorrect by optical and by the present microwave experiments. In order to extract true 1/\tau^{c}(T) in the oxygen

  reduced samples, we need a more careful analysis.

The recent systematic investigation of the anisotropic penetration depth \lambda in La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} claimed that the response of the superfluid can be regarded two-dimensional in the superconducting state,[6] and concluded that \lambda^{c} is determined by the intrinsic Josephson current across the CuO_{2} planes. The observed large anisotropy of the penetration depth in oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (see Table 1) implies that the supercurrent along the c axis in this system is also characterized by a Josephson-like coupling mechanism.[17] In other words, \lambda^{c} in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} may be determined by Josephson current flowing between the CuO_{2} bilayers. Therefore, together with the above presented results on the c-axis conductivity, we conclude that the charge dynamics of both superfluids and quasiparticles in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} has a strong two-dimensional nature in the superconducting state. The strong two-dimensional nature in the oxygen-reduced YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} is also observed in the resistivity[1] and optical conductivity[2] measurements in the normal state. Then, one can say that the large anisotropy in the charge dynamics (or the strong confinement of charges in CuO_{2} layers) in the normal state remains valid even in the superconducting state.

For the fully oxygenated YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}, we have observed exceptionally high \sigma_{1}^{c} below T_{c}. One possible explanation is the effect of the insertion of the CuO conducting chain into the superconducting layers. It has been pointed out that the CuO chains inserted between CuO_{2} planes contribute to the normal-state conduction along the c direction.[1, 2] However, the present results may also come from the intrinsic change in the high-T_{c} superconductivity as a function of the hole concentration. More detailed investigation is needed for other optimal- and over-doped materials.

In conclusion, we have measured the microwave conductivity perpendicular to the CuO_{2} planes as a function of temperature in the fully oxygenated and oxygen-reduced crystals of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}. The c-axis \sigma_{1}(T) in the fully oxygenated sample shows a broad peak similar to the in-plane \sigma_{1}(T), suggesting exceptionally isotropic scattering in the superconducting state. In contrast, for the oxygen-reduced samples \sigma_{1}^{c}(T) remains at low level and shows no drastic enhancement below T_{c}. The results imply the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the CuO_{2} planes even in the superconducting state.
