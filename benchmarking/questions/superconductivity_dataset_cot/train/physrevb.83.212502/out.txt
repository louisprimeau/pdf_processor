25 December 2 was measured with the _Quantum Design_ MPMS-SQUID. The measurement of resistivity and magnetoresistance were performed using the _Quantum Design_ PPMS-9.

Figure 1 shows the x-ray single crystal diffraction and powder XRD after crushing the single crystals to powder for K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}. Only (00/_t_) reflections were recognized in Fig. 1(a), indicating that both types of single crystals were perfectly oriented along c axis. The lattice parameters are obtained to index the powder XRD patterns in Fig. 1(b) with the symmetry of I4/mmm and a = 3.8912 A and c = 14.1390 A for K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}. The lattice constant a obtained here is smaller than that in Refs. [21]. Small peaks can be found near the main (00/_t_) peaks, which should arise from the intrinsic inhomogeneous distribution of the intercalated alkali atoms.[23] The actual compositions of K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} were determined by ICP-AES to be K:Fe:Se = 0.75:1.66:2, indicative of deficiencies on both K and Fe sites and consistent with the previous reports.[18; 19] For Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, the lattice parameters determined from the powder XRD patterns are a = 3.9618 A and c = 15.285 A, which is almost the same as that in Ref. [21]. The actual composition of this crystal was determined by ICP-AES to be Cs:Fe:Se = 0.81:1.61:2, indicative of deficiencies on both Cs and Fe sites. This is consistent with previous reports.[20]

Figure 2(a) shows the resistivity and susceptibility measurements at low temperature for K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}. The resistivity starts to drop quickly at about 31 K and it reaches zero at about 28.7 K. The ZFC and field cooling (FC) susceptibilities show that the superconductive shielding begins to emerge at about 29 K with magnetic field parallel to the _ab_ plane taken at 10 Oe. The superconductive shielding fraction estimated from the ZFC magnetization at 2 K is about 90%, which indicates the bulk superconductivity nature and good quality of the crystals. This superconductive shielding fraction is much larger than that in previous reports.[18; 19; 20] Figure 2(b) shows the low-temperature resistivity and susceptibility measurements for Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}. The onset transition temperature is about 30 K, and zero resistance is reached at 26.5 K. The superconductivity transition temperature taken from the ZFC and FC curves is estimated about 25.5 K. The superconductive shielding fraction estimated from the ZFC magnetization reaches 100% below 10 K estimated from the ZFC curve. It indicates a much better superconductivity than the crystals in the previous report.[20]

The temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity for the K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} from 10 to 300 K are shown in Fig. 3. The K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} crystal shows the semiconducting behavior at the high temperature and displays a broad maximum at about 125 K. This temperature is slightly higher than that in the report by Guo _et al_. (around 100 K),[18] but much smaller than that reported by Mizuguchi _et al_. (\sim200 K).[19] Also, the maximum resistivity in our sample (170 m\Omega cm) is much smaller than that in previous report (\sim3000 m\Omega cm).[19] The different temperature and magnitude of the maximum resistivity could be related to the different deficiency of Fe or K. With further decreasing the temperature, the resistivity exhibits a metallic behavior and superconductivity emerges at about 30 K. The resistivity of Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} shows a metallic behavior in the whole measuring temperature range, being quite different from that of the K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}. The resistivity of K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} are 70 and 1350 m\Omega cm at room temperature, respectively, and all these values are much larger than those of FeSe single crystals[24] and the iron-pnictide superconductors.[25] This may arise from the strong scattering from large disorder induced by the Fe deficiencies.

The hump in XRD pattern for Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} comes from the Mylar film, which has been used to protect the sample from air.

  The resistivity of K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} with different magnitude of magnetic field applied parallel and perpendicular to the ab plane around T_{\rm c} are shown in Fig. (4(a)-4(d)), respectively. The transition temperature of superconductivity is suppressed gradually and the transition is broadened with increasing magnetic field. We defined the T_{\rm c} as the temperature where the resistivity was 90%, 50%, and 10% drop right above the superconducting transition. The anisotropy of the H_{\rm c2}(T) for K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} is shown in Fig. 4(e) and 4(f), respectively. Within the weak-coupling BCS theory, the upper critical field at T=0 K can be determined by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) equation[26]H_{\rm c2}(0)=0.693[-(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)]_{T_{\rm c}}T_{\rm c}. Using the data of H_{\rm c2}(T) for the 90% resistivity drop, one obtains [-(dH_{\rm c2}^{ab}/dT)]_{T_{\rm c}}=9.86 T/K, [-(dH_{\rm c2}^{c}/dT)]_{T_{\rm c}}=3.17 T/K, and T_{\rm c}=30.5 K. The H_{\rm c2}(0) can be estimated to be 208 and 67 T with the field parallel and perpendicular to the ab plane for K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, respectively. These values are a little larger than those in previous report.[19] For Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} crystal, we have [-(dH_{\rm c2}^{ab}/dT)]_{T_{\rm c}}=6.21 T/K, [-(dH_{\rm c2}^{c}/dT)]_{T_{\rm c}}=2.13 T/K and T_{\rm c}=29.3 K. The H_{\rm c2}(0) is estimated to be 126 and 43 T with the field parallel and perpendicular to the ab plane, respectively. They are much smaller than those of K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} although their T_{\rm c}s are close to each other. We estimated the anisotropy H_{\rm c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{\rm c2}^{c}(0) to be 3.1 and 2.9 for K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, respectively. This anisotropy value is larger than 1.70-1.86 in Ba_{0.60}K_{0.40}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [27]) and 1-2 in Fe(Se,Te) system,[28] but smaller than 4-6 in F-doped NdFeAsO.[29] Our results clearly indicate that the upper critical fields in the intercalated FeSe superconductors are higher than FeSe without any doubt.[10]

Figure 5 shows the magnetic susceptibility of Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} with the magnetic field of 5 T applied parallel and perpendicular to the c axis. The magnetic susceptibility decreases gradually with decreasing the temperature at high temperature. The susceptibility starts to go upward at around 115 K with the field perpendicular to the c axis. While for the field parallel to the c axis, the susceptibility shows no upturn. The anomaly around 26 K is due to the transition of superconductivity. The decrease in susceptibility with temperature cooling down at high temperatures indicates there exists an antiferromagnetic coupling. Actually, recent neutron diffraction results indicate the spins aligned antiferromagnetically along the c axis below about 500 K.[30] The large value of susceptibility for field applied within the ab plane can be interpreted on the basis of such magnetic structure. Because of the strong strength of the antiferromagnetic alignment of the spins along c axis inferred

  from the very high transition temperature and large magnetic moment,[30] spins are easier to turn toward the direction of the magnetic field as field is applied within _ab_ plane, which would surely induce the larger susceptibility. The occurrence of superconductivity could be related to such peculiar magnetic properties.

In summary, we successfully grew the single crystals of K- and Cs-intercalated FeSe compounds. T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} is 31 and 30 K for K_{\rm x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{\rm x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, respectively. The ZFC dc magnetic susceptibility indicates that the superconductive shielding fraction is close to 100% for both types of crystals. The large H_{\rm c2} observed in these materials is similar to the other iron-pnictide superconductors.[32] The anisotropy H_{\rm c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{\rm c2}^{c}(0) is around 3 for both the two materials. The normal state resistivity is very large compared with the other iron-based superconductors. Such large resistivity could arise from the Fe vacancy in conducting FeSe layer.[30, 32, 33] Very high electrical resistance in these superconducting compounds could challenge the theoretical scenario for the mechanism of superconductivity. It should be addressed that their T_{\rm c} is nearly the same although the resistivity behavior in K_{\rm x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{\rm x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} is quite different.

It indicates a much better superconductivity than the crystals in the previous report.[20]

The temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity for the K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} from 10 to 300 K are shown in Fig. 3.

In summary, we successfully grew the single crystals of K- and Cs-intercalated FeSe compounds. T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset} is 31 and 30 K for K_{\rm x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{\rm x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, respectively. The ZFC dc magnetic susceptibility indicates that the superconductive shielding fraction is close to 100% for both types of crystals. The large H_{\rm c2} observed in these materials is similar to the other iron-pnictide superconductors.[32] The anisotropy H_{\rm c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{\rm c2}^{c}(0) is around 3 for both the two materials. The normal state resistivity is very large compared with the other iron-based superconductors. Such large resistivity could arise from the Fe vacancy in conducting FeSe layer.[30, 32, 33] Very high electrical resistance in these superconducting compounds could challenge the theoretical scenario for the mechanism of superconductivity. It should be addressed that their T_{\rm c} is nearly the same although the resistivity behavior in K_{\rm x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} and Cs_{\rm x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} is quite different.
