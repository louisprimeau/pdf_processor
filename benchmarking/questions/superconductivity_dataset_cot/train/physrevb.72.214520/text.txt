###### Abstract

The ternary germanide La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) has been prepared by arc melting. This compound takes a body-centered lattice with an orthorhombic unit cell with the lattice parameters of \(a\) = 4.2200(3) A, \(b\) = 4.3850(3) A, and c =25.003(2) A. The crystal structure of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) is U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type with the space group of _Immm_, consisting of the combination of structural units of AlB\({}_{2}\)-type and BaAl\({}_{4}\)-type layers. This compound is a type-II superconductor with a critical temperature (_T_c) of 2.75 K. The lower critical field _H_c1(0) is estimated to be 54 Oe. The upper critical field _H_c2(0) estimated by linear extrapolation of the _H_c2(7) curves is about 4.0 kOe, whereas the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory gives _H_c2(0)WH1=3.0 kOe. This is an interesting observation of superconductivity in the compounds with U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type structure. The coherence length _g_(0) of 330 A and the penetration depth \(\lambda\)(0) of 2480 A are derived.

## I Introduction

Among ternary intermetallic compounds, ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\)-type intermetallics, RE_T_2\(M\)2 (RE= rare earth, _T_=transition metal, \(M\) = Si and Ge), have been extensively studied, especially for the interest of the superconducting and magnetic properties. The structure of ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) is the ordered ternary derivative of the binary BaAl\({}_{4}\)-type structure.\({}^{1}\) Although superconductivity is observed for some compounds, the critical temperature (_T_c) is as low as 1 K, as reported for LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\) and LaPt\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\) with _T_c's of 1.12 and 0.55 K, respectively.\({}^{2}\) Many works were carried out for the discovery of different intermetallic superconductors with higher _T_c's. Finally, quaternary intermetallic borocarbide superconductors RE_T_2B2C with ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\)-derivative structure showing high _T_c's were discovered.\({}^{3-6}\) Among these compounds, YPd\({}_{3}\)B\({}_{2}\)C shows a _T_c of 23 K, which is the highest among ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\)-type intermetallic compounds.

Apart from ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\)-type structure, another intermetallic superconductor, MgB\({}_{2}\), was discovered several years ago.\({}^{7}\) The MgB\({}_{2}\) shows a _T_c as high as 39 K, which is the highest among intermetallic compounds. The structure of the MgB\({}_{2}\) is AlB\({}_{2}\)-type structure, which is composed of alternating hexagonal layers of Al atoms and graphitelike honeycomb layers of B atoms. Many works have been done so far on the compounds with AlB\({}_{2}\)-type structure after the discovery of MgB\({}_{2}\), and several superconductors with this structure have been reported.\({}^{8,9}\) In this paper we report a different ternary germanide superconductor, La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\).

## II Experiment

Starting materials were La (chunk, 99.9% in purity), Pd (sheet, 99.99%), and Ge (granule, 99.999%). They were arc melted with a stoichiometric ratio of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) under Ar gas atmosphere on a water-cooler copper hearth. The melting was repeated several times with the button turned over between each melt. The weight loss was less than 1%. After melting, the obtained button wrapped in a Mo foil was annealed in an evacuated silica tube at 1173 K for one week.

Phase identification was carried out for crushed powder samples by an x-ray-diffraction (XRD) method with an x-ray diffractometer JEOL JDX-3500. The XRD patterns were fitted using the Rietveld refinement program rietan 2000.\({}^{10}\) Microstructural observation was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectrometer. Electron diffraction (ED) patterns and high-resolution electron microscope (HREM) images were recorded for crushed samples using a JEOL JEM-4000EX. The crushed samples were dispersed in CCl\({}_{4}\) and transferred to carbon coated copper grids. Image calculations were carried out using a mactempas software program.

dc magnetization measurements were performed for bulk and crushed powder samples with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer, Quantum Design MPMS XL. _M-H_ and _M-T_ curves were recorded at temperatures above 1.8 K in fields up to 5 kOe. The volume fraction of the superconducting phase was estimated from the magnitude of zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization in a field of 10 Oe in the _M-T_ measurements. The _T_c was defined as the onset temperature where a diamagnetic signal was observed. Electrical resistivity measurements were carried out in the temperature range from 1.8 to 300 K by a standard dc four-probe method.

## III Results and Discussion

SEM-EDX analysis was performed on the polished cross section of the samples. The composition of the main phase in the samples was La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). ED patterns taken along the various zone axes for the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) phase suggest that the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) takes an orthorhombic unit cell with the lattice parameters of \(a\) = 4.22 A, \(b\) = 4.39 A, and \(c\) = 25.0 A. The reflection condition was \(h\) + \(k\) + \(l\) = 2\(n\). These indicate that the lattice of the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) is body-centered with a suggested space group of _Immm_2,_ \(I\)222,_ \(I\)212_12_1, or _Immm_.

Most of the diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern were indexed on the basis of an orthorhombic unit cell with the lattice parameters of \(a\) = 4.2200(3) A, \(b\) = 4.3850(3) A, and \(c\) = 25.003(2) A. This is in agreement with the lattice parameters obtained from the ED patterns. Other small peaks could be indexed on the basis of a tetragonal unit cell of LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\) with the space group of \(I\)4/_mmm_ with the lattice parameters of \(a\) = 4.3692(9) A and \(c\) = 10.023(2) A. These lattice parameters of the LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\) are slightly smaller than those reported previously.[11] Although some shiny crystals were observed in the crushed samples, they were identified as LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\) single crystal.

Analog compounds, La\({}_{3}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) and Ce\({}_{3}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\), take U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type structure with an orthorhombic unit cell with the space group of _Immm_.[12, 13] The lattice parameters of La\({}_{3}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) are \(a\) = 4.1746(3) A, \(b\) = 4.2412(2) A, and \(c\) = 25.234(3) A, whereas the lattice parameters of Ce\({}_{3}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) are \(a\) = 4.0915(5) A, \(b\) = 4.2400(19) A, and \(c\) = 25.0673(82) A. These parameters are almost equal to those of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). Therefore the crystal structure of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) was refined on the basis of the U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type structural model with the space group of _Immm_. The Rietveld refinements for the XRD patterns were carried out for La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) and LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\) simultaneously. Tables 1 and 2 list the final results of the refinements for La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). The atomic parameters are listed in Table 1, and the lattice parameters and the \(R\) factors[14] are listed in Table 2. The volume fractions of the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) and LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\) were estimated to be 96 and 4 %, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the observed, the calculated, and the difference pattern. The final _R_wp factor was 15.06%. This relatively high _R_wp factor may be due to the presence of impurity phases other than LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\). The presence of the LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\) and the weight loss less than 1% after arc melting suggest the presence of a small amount of other impurity phases. The XRD peaks of the other impurity phases may overlap those of the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) and LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\).

The isotropic thermal parameters \(B\) of all the atoms in the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) were fixed at 1.0 for the fitting, because the refinement of those \(B\) parameters caused not only smaller _R_wp(=14%) but also \(B\) \(<\) 0. The structural refinements on the basis of other space groups were not successful. Therefore the U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type structure with the space group of _Immm_ is probably the most suitable for La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\).

A [010] HREM image of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) is shown in Fig. 2. Here the corresponding ED pattern and calculated image are together shown in the inset. The image calculations were carried out with the results of the refinements listed in Tables 1 and 2. The calculated image along the [010] zone axis was obtained with (\(\Delta f,t\)) = (\(-\)760 A,18 A). Here \(\Delta f\) and \(t\) denote defocus values and specimen thickness, respectively. In the experimental image, regular structure along the \(c\) axis with

Figure 1: Observed, calculated, and difference x-ray-diffraction data for La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). Plus marks (+) and the overlapped continuous line indicate the observed diffraction data and the calculated pattern, respectively. The refinement was carried out on the basis of U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type structural model with the space group of _Immm_. The background was fitted as a part of the refinement. The upper and lower vertical lines below the pattern denote the peak positions of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) and LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\), respectively. The difference between observed and calculated intensities is shown at the bottom in the same scale.

  the periodicity of 25 A is clearly observed, and no irregular intergrowth of blocks is observed. This is in agreement with the corresponding ED pattern where no streaks along the _c\({}^{*}\)_ axis are observed. Compared with the experimental and calculated images, the calculated image is in good agreement with the corresponding experimental image. With the results of the Rietveld refinements mentioned above, we conclude that the crystal structure of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) is U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\) type with the space group of _Inmmm_.

Figure 3 shows the crystal structure of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). This structure is composed of combination of structural units of AlB\({}_{2}\)-type and BaAl\({}_{4}\)-type layers according to the relation 2La(Pd\({}_{0.5}\)Ge\({}_{0.5}\))\({}_{2}\)+LaPd\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\)=La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). The U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type structure is observed for other related compounds, _R\({}_{3}\)_Rh\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) (_R_=La and Ce), as mentioned above. On the other hand, _Ln\({}_{3}\)_Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) (_Ln_= Y, Gd-Yb) takes the same body-centered lattice with the orthorhombic unit cell with the space group of _Inmmm_, but the structure is not U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\) type but Gd\({}_{3}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\)(Li\({}_{4}\)Sr\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{4}\)) type.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] Whereas the size of La is large and its atomic radius is 1.87 A, the atomic radii of _Ln_ are smaller than that of La due to lanthanide contraction. The atomic radii of _Ln_ are too small to form U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type structure.

Both U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\)-type and Gd\({}_{3}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\)(Li\({}_{4}\)Sr\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{4}\))-type structures contain structural units of AlB\({}_{2}\)-type layers. The essential difference between these structures is the coordination of the Ni and Cu. In La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\), only the Pd atoms in the BaAl\({}_{4}\) layers are tetrahedrally surrounded by Ge atoms, whereas other Pd atoms in the AlB\({}_{2}\) layers are surrounded by three Ge atoms in a trigonal planar configuration. On the other hand, in _Ln\({}_{3}\)_Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) with Li\({}_{4}\)Sr\({}_{3}\)Sb\({}_{4}\)-type structure, all the Pd atoms are located in the center of a tetrahedron of Ge.

Figure 4 shows temperature-dependent dc magnetization measured in a field of 10 Oe both in ZFC and field-cooled (FC) modes for La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). For the bulk sample, the diamagnetic signals are observed at 2.75 K for both modes with a 10-90 % transition width of about 0.2 K. The magnitude of magnetic shielding signal after being corrected for demagnetization effects is approximately equal to 100% of that estimated for perfect diamagnetism, while the magnitude of flux expulsion (Meissner effect) is approximately 5% of that estimated for perfect diamagnetism. The hysteresis observed between the signals in ZFC and FC modes indicates that this compound is a type-II superconductor.

The same dc magnetization measurements were carried out for finely crushed powder samples. This is also shown in

Figure 3: Crystal structure of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). Here La, Pd, and Ge are denoted by large, medium, and small circles, respectively.

The unit cell and calculated image of La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) are indicated by solid and dashed lines, respectively, in the experimental image. Regular structure with the periodicity of 25 Å along the \(c\) axis is observed. The calculated image was obtained with (\(\Delta f\),\(t\))=(\(-760\) Å,\(18\) Å). Here \(\Delta f\) and \(t\) denote defocus values and specimen thickness, respectively.

The La atom is imaged as large white dots, whereas the Pd and Ge atoms are merged as ellipsoidal gray dots.

  Fig. 4. Compared with the result obtained for the bulk sample, the powder samples show a slightly lower \(T_{\rm c}\) with broader transition and the magnitude of the FC magnetization is much larger. The magnitude of flux expulsion at 1.8 K is about half that of the ZFC magnetization. This difference is due to the magnetic flux trapping by the absence of a weak-link problem.[21] In the state of fine powder, the magnetic flux is easily expelled from the sample, resulting in the large Meissner effect. This indicates that the diamagnetic signal is due to the bulk superconductivity. The broadening of the transition observed for the powder sample is also reported for other compounds.[21, 22]

Figure 5 shows the field dependence of magnetization curves \(M(H)\) measured for the bulk sample at various temperatures. The details of the same curves in the background region are shown in the inset. These curves are characteristic for type-II superconductors. Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization curves \(M(T)\) measured for the bulk sample at various magnetic fields. The details of the same curves in the vicinity of \(T_{\rm c}\) are also shown in the inset. Small kinks observed in the \(M(T)\) curves at around 2.2 K are due to the temperature instability of the SQUID magnetometer.

The apparent lower critical field (\(H_{\rm c1}^{*}\))of the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) was determined by low-field magnetization measurements. \(H_{\rm c1}^{*}\) at various temperatures was taken as the point of deviation of \(M(H)\) from the linear \(M\)-\(H\) behavior observed at low magnetic fields. The true lower critical field (\(H_{\rm c1}\)) was obtained from the \(H_{\rm c1}^{*}\) by applying the correction for the demagnetization factor. The \(H_{\rm c1}\) as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 7. Fitting with the formula \(H_{\rm c1}\) =\(H_{\rm c1}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}]\) results in \(H_{\rm c1}(0)\) = 54 Oe. The \(H_{\rm c1}(0)\) is much lower than that of intermetallic Ni-based borocarbide superconductors (around 800 Oe) (Ref. [23]) and MgB\({}_{2}\) (around 400 Oe).[24]

The upper critical field (\(H_{\rm c2}\)) was estimated from both \(M(H)\) and \(M(T)\) curves. For the \(M(H)\) curves, the \(H_{\rm c2}\) was determined from the point where the \(M(H)\) curves reach the background. For the \(M(T)\) curves, the \(H_{\rm c2}\) was estimated, taking account of the onset point of superconducting transition of the \(M(T)\) curves. The \(H_{\rm c2}\) estimated from these curves as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 8.

Both \(H_{\rm c2}(T)\) curves obtained from the \(M(H)\) and \(M(T)\) curves show a positive curvature in the vicinity of \(T_{\rm c}\), similar to other superconductors, such as Li\({}_{2}\)Pd\({}_{3}\)B (Ref. [22]) and borocarbides.[23] Except for this region, the gradient \(-dH_{\rm c2}/dT\) is estimated to be 1.6 kOe/K for both \(H_{\rm c2}(T)\) curves. These values are comparable to those reported for other ternary rare-earth transition-metal silicides and ger

Figure 4: Temperature-dependent dc magnetization curves for La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\). The data were recorded in zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) modes for the bulk and powder samples. The applied field was 10 Oe.

The details of the same curves in the background region are shown in the inset. The points where the \(M(H)\) curves reach the background are indicated by arrows for each temperature.

  manides with low \(T_{\rm c}\)s, such as RE\({}_{2}T_{\rm d}X_{10}\) (RE=rare earth, \(T\) =transition metal, \(X\)=Si or Ge). [25] Linear extrapolation of the \(H_{\rm c2}(T)\) curves obtained from the \(M(H)\) and \(M(T)\) curves gives \(H_{\rm c2}(0)^{M.H}\)=4.0 kOe and \(H_{\rm c2}(0)^{M.T}\)=4.1 kOe, respectively. On the other hand, assuming the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohemberg (WHH) formula \(H_{\rm c2}(0)^{\rm WHH}=-0.69T_{\rm c}(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)_{T_{\rm c2}}\). [26, 27]\(H_{\rm c2}(0)^{\rm WHH}\) of 3.0 kOe is obtained from both \(H_{\rm c2}(T)\) curves. In the following calculations, we have used \(H_{\rm c2}(0)^{\rm WHH}\) for \(H_{\rm c2}(0)\).

With the formula \(H_{\rm c2}\)= \(\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}\) (\(\Phi_{0}\) the flux quantum), the coherence length \(\xi(0)\) is estimated to be 330 A. This value is several times larger than those of borocarbide superconductors [5, 23] and MgB\({}_{2}\). [24] From \(H_{\rm c2}(0)\) and \(\xi(0)\), the penetration depth \(\lambda(0)\) is calculated to be 2480 A with the formula \(H_{\rm c1}\)=(\(\Phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda^{2}\))ln(\(\lambda/\xi\)). This value is comparable to that of Pt-based borocarbide superconductors [5] and a few times larger than that of MgB\({}_{2}\). [24] The Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa(0)\) is 7.5, derived from the formula \(\kappa(0)\) = \(\lambda(0)/\xi(0)\), and thermodynamic critical field \(H_{\rm c}(0)\) is 280 Oe with the formula of \(H_{\rm c}(0)\)=\(H_{\rm c2}(0)/\sqrt{2\kappa(0)}\). Table III lists these measured and derived superconducting parameters.

The electrical resistivity \(\rho\) as a function of temperature for La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) is shown in Fig. 9. The detail of the region in the vicinity of \(T_{\rm c}\) is shown in the inset. The resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature, showing metallic-type conductivity. The onset temperature of the transition is 2.85 K, and zero resistance is observed at 2.75 K. From 300 to 20 K, the temperature-dependent resistivity curve shows a small negative curvature. The room temperature resistivity, \(\rho\)(300 K), is approximately 270 \(\mu\Omega\)cm, and the residual resistivity, \(\rho\) (res), just above \(T_{\rm c}\), is 11 \(\mu\Omega\)cm. The resistivity residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is \(\rho\)(300 K)/\(\rho\)(res)=24.5. Such a small negative curvature and relatively high RRR are also reported for other ternary superconducting germanides such as Y\({}_{5}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{10}\). [25]

## IV Conclusions

We have prepared ternary germanide La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) by arc melting. The crystal structure of this compound is U\({}_{3}\)Ni\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{4}\) type with the space group of _Immm_, consisting of combination of structural units of AlB\({}_{2}\)-type and BaAl\({}_{4}\)-type layers. The lattice parameters of the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) are \(a\) = 4.2200(3) A , \(b\) = 4.3850(3) A , and \(c\) = 25.003(2) A . dc magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements indicated that the La\({}_{3}\)Pd\({}_{4}\)Ge\({}_{4}\) is a type-II superconductor with a _Tc_ of 2.75 K. The lower critical field \(H_{c1}(0)\) is 54 Oe. The upper critical fields \(H_{c2}(0)\) estimated by linear extrapolation of the \(H_{c2}(T)\) curves obtained from the \(M(H)\) and \(M(T)\) curves give \(H_{c2}(0)^{M:H}\)= 4.0 kOe and \(H_{c2}(0)^{M:T}\)= 4.1 kOe, respectively. On the other hand, the WHH theory gives \(H_{c2}(0)^{\rm WHH}\)= 3.0 kOe.
