###### Abstract

The in-plane and out-of-plane magnetoresistances of moderately overdoped Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+x} single crystals have been studied from T_{c}+5 K to T_{c}+100 K with the magnetic field oriented perpendicular and parallel to the current, respectively. The in-plane magnetoresistance is positive, the out-of-plane magnetoresistance negative, and their temperature variations depend on the orientation of the magnetic field. A recent theory for superconducting order parameter fluctuations is extended for the interaction of carrier spins with the magnetic field. The anomalous, anisotropic magnetoresistance can be described well by a unique set of physical parameters, which were found to correspond to estimates from the normal-state transport properties.

A detailed understanding of the unconventional anisotropic properties in the normal state of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) is indispensable to successfully clarify the mechanism for superconductivity in these compounds. A large number of features of the in-plane and out-of-plane electrical-transport properties have been collected so far, which are in sharp contradiction to the classical Bloch-Boltzmann transport theory.[1] One of these is the contrasting temperature dependence of the "metallic" in-plane (\rho_{ab}) and the "'semiconducting" out-of-plane (\rho_{c}) resistivities in some highly anisotropic HTS that persists down to low temperatures.[2] Application of a magnetic field results in a positive in-plane magnetoresistance (MR) \Delta\rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(0)>0 that violates Kohler's rule[3, 4] and a negative out-of-plane MR \Delta\rho_{c}/\rho_{c}(0)<0.[5, 6] Possible explanations for \Delta\rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(0) include two different carrier scattering rates[7] far above T_{c} and the magnetic-field suppression of superconducting order parameter fluctuations close to T_{c}.[8]\Delta\rho_{c}/\rho_{c}(0) has been interpreted in terms of a spin gap,[6] by interplane tunneling together with a renormalization of the carrier density of states as a result of superconducting fluctuations,[9, 5] and several other models. In this paper, we report simultaneous measurements of the anisotropic MR and their interpretation in a coherent model.

For the present paper, we have selected the strongly anisotropic (\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}> 10^{4}) system Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+x} (2212-BSCCO) that can be prepared as slightly underdoped to overdoped single crystals. In order to exclude effects of the "pseudogap" or "spin gap" to our measurements, we have limited our study to slightly overdoped 2212-BSCCO single crystals, where the characteristic deviation from the linear \rho_{ab}(T) behavior below a certain temperature T* is absent.[10] The single crystals were grown by a self-flux method and a segregation growth technique.[11] The as-grown crystals were cleaved and cut into pieces of approximately 500 \times 1500 \mum^{2} in the ab plane and 1 - 25 \mum along the c direction. All samples were checked for phase purity by x-ray diffraction and showed no traces of the 2223 phase. The oxygen content was adjusted by annealing in flowing oxygen at 500 ^{\circ}C to obtain crystals in the overdoped region of the BSCCO phase diagram with a zero resistance T_{c0} from 78 to 80 K.

The very large anisotropy of BSCCO requires that the transport properties are measured with two different contact arrangements on two identically prepared samples, cleaved from the same large crystal. The very similar properties are confirmed by the agreement of their T_{c0} values within 0.1 K (see Fig. 1). The in-plane transport measurements were performed using a four-probe arrangement with large current

  contacts of silver paint entirely covering the _ac_ faces of the crystals to ensure a homogeneous current distribution in the sample. The voltage contacts were established by a thin Au wire on evaporated silver pads. The out-of-plane measurements were performed with two arrangements of ring-shaped current electrodes, with a voltage probe in the center, on the top, and bottom sides of the crystal.

The MR of the crystals was measured in a standard superconducting magnet in magnetic fields up to B\!=\!\pm\!13 T. The temperature was recorded in zero field using a calibrated RhFe sensor, and held constant during the magnetic field sweep with a Cernox (Lake Shore CX-1080-AA) thermometer. A possible MR of the Cernox sensor is a crucial source of error for MR measurements in HTS and was carefully investigated.[12] A lock-in technique at a frequency of 17.4 Hz was applied for all measurements and the in-plane and the out-of-plane current densities were 300 A/cm^{2} and 0.4 A/cm^{2}, respectively. Above 82 K the resistance was independent of the current density within about one order of magnitude. The crystal's _ab_ plane was aligned precisely with respect to the magnetic field in a rotating sample holder with an angular resolution of better than 0.1^{\circ}.

In the normal state of a superconductor, the conductivity tensor \sigma_{ij}^{N} has to be corrected for additional contributions from thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter \sigma_{ij}\!=\!\sigma_{ij}^{N}\!+\!\sigma_{ij}^{fl}. The latter are usually small, except very close to T_{c}, in the critical temperature region. The direct, or Aslamazov-Larkin (AL), fluctuation process can be considered as a short-lived, superconducting droplet in thermal nonequilibrium, which is accelerated in an electric and deflected in a magnetic field, resulting in the above corrections to the normal-state transport. In addition, indirect interactions of fluctuations with normal-state quasiparticles [Maki-Thompson (MT)] and the reduction of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) have been proposed.[13] Outside the critical region the various contributions to the fluctuation conductivity tensor are additive. The at-present most complete microscopic theory[14] calculates several diagonal elements \sigma_{ii}^{fl}(T,B) for direct and indirect contributions and for arbitrary ratios of the mean-free-path and the coherence lengths. The formulas are valid between the clean and the dirty limit[15, 18] approximations, and therefore account optimally for the situation in the cuprates, in particular for BSCCO. In this context only the orbital (O) contributions for B\|c have been considered and spin interactions, i.e., the Zeeman (Z) effect,[16] were neglected.

The change of the fluctuation conductivity in a magnetic field [magnetoconductivity (MC)] is \Delta\sigma_{ii}^{fl}\!=\!\sigma_{ii}^{fl}(T,B) - \sigma_{ii}^{fl}(T,0). The results for the in-plane ALO effect \Delta\sigma_{xz}^{ALO} (the in-plane DOS effect is considered negligible in HTS), and the out-of-plane ALO (\Delta\sigma_{zz}^{ALO}) and orbital DOS (\Delta\sigma_{zz}^{DOSO}) contributions in a layered superconductor are given in Ref. [14]. The theory contains no phenomenological, but only three microscopic parameters, the interlayer coupling energy J, the Fermi velocity v_{F}, and a quasiparticle scattering time \tau. Their values, in principle, are determined by the normal-state transport properties. We have assumed a temperature dependent \tau\!=\!\tau(100 K)(T/200 K+\frac{1}{2})^{-1}\sim\!\rho_{ab}^{-1} according to Fig. 1.

For B\!\perp\!c and at reduced temperatures \varepsilon\!>\!0.1 for B\|c, the Zeeman interaction with the fluctuations is no longer negligible compared to the orbital process. The corresponding Zeeman terms for the in-plane AL and MT processes were considered previously[16] in the phenomenological fluctuation theory for the dirty-limit case. We use this renormalization of the reduced temperature to account for a shift in T_{c} due to the pair-breaking of the Zeeman energy

\[\varepsilon_{Z}\!=\!\varepsilon+\mathrm{Re}\Bigg{[}\Psi\Bigg{\\frac{1}{2}\! +\!\frac{Ig\,\mu_{B}B}{4\,\pi k_{B}T_{c}}\Bigg{\}}\!-\!\Psi\Bigg{\\frac{1}{2}\Bigg{\}}\Bigg{]},\] (1)

where \varepsilon\!=\!\ln(T/T_{c}) is a reduced temperature, \Psi is the Di-gamma function, g the Lande factor, assumed to be g\!=\!2, I is the imaginary unit, \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton, and k_{B} is the Boltzmann's constant. Using the procedure of Ref. [16], we extend the microscopic model[14] for the Zeeman contributions

\[\Delta\sigma_{xx}^{ALZ}\!=\!\frac{e^{2}}{16\,\hbar s}\Bigg{[}\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \varepsilon_{Z}(\varepsilon_{Z}\!+\!r)}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon( \varepsilon\!+\!r)}}\Bigg{]},\] (2)

\[\Delta\sigma_{zz}^{ALZ}\!=\!\frac{e^{2}s}{32\,\hbar\,\eta}\Bigg{[}\frac{ \varepsilon_{Z}\!+\!\frac{r}{2}}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_{Z}(\varepsilon_{Z}\!+\!r) }}-\frac{\varepsilon+\frac{r}{2}}{\sqrt{\varepsilon(\varepsilon\!+\!r)}} \Bigg{]},\] (3)

\[\Delta\sigma_{zz}^{DOSZ}\!=\!-\frac{e^{2}\,\kappa sT}{8\,\hbar\, \eta}\Bigg{[}\ln\!\frac{\sqrt{1+\varepsilon_{Z}\!+\!\sqrt{1+\varepsilon_{Z}\!+ \!r}}}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_{Z}\!+\!\sqrt{\varepsilon_{Z}\!+\!r}}}\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \qquad  MR in both orientations changes tremendously in the vicinity of T_{c} and exhibits a lower temperature dependence at elevated temperatures. This fact immediately suggests that superconducting fluctuations must be considered.

In Fig. 2 we compare the in-plane MC \Delta\sigma_{ab} = 1/\rho_{ab}(B) - 1/\rho_{ab}(0) = -\Delta\rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}^{2}(0) in the transverse (B\|c\perp j) and the longitudinal (B\|j\perp c) arrangement with the above theory. Note that a positive MR corresponds to a negative MC. The parameters used to calculate the theoretical curves were v_{F} = 1.5\times10^{7} cm/s, J/k_{B} = 4.5 K, and \tau = 20 fs, and will be discussed later.

Finally, we want to comment briefly on the limitations of our analysis. The superconducting fluctuation theory except of the MT terms is rather robust regarding the actual mechanism responsible for high-T_{c} superconductivity, since essential parts can be also calculated in the framework of the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory.
