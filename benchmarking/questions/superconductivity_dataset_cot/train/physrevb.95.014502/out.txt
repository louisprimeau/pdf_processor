###### Abstract

We report measurements of the upper critical field H_{\rm c2} as functions of temperature T, polar angle \theta (of the field direction with respect to the crystallographic c axis), and azimuthal angle \phi (of the field direction relative to the a axis within the ab plane) for the Cr-based superconductor K2Cr3As3 with a quasi-one-dimensional and noncentrosymmetric crystal structure. We confirm that the anisotropy in H_{\rm c2}(T) becomes inverse with decreasing temperature. At low temperatures, H_{\rm c2}(\theta) data are featured by two maxima at \theta=0 (**H**\mid c) and \pi/2 (**H**\perp c), which can be quantitatively understood only if uniaxial effective-mass anisotropy and absence of Pauli paramagnetic effect for **H\perp c** are taken simultaneously into consideration. The in-plane H_{\rm c2}(\theta) profile shows a unique threefold modulation especially at low temperatures. Overall, the characteristics of the H_{\rm c2}(\theta,\phi,T) data mostly resemble those of the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt3, and we argue in favor of a dominant spin-triplet superconductivity with odd parity in K2Cr3As3.

## 1 Introduction

Unconventional superconductors are those materials that possess exotic superconductivity (SC) whose origin cannot be explained by electron-phonon interactions in Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [1]. A more operable description for unconventional superconductors addresses an additional symmetry broken [2], apart from the U(1)-gauge symmetry and crystalline-lattice symmetry. Examples of unconventional superconductors include, chronologically, CeCu2Si2[3], organic superconductors [4], UPt3[5], high-T_{\rm c} cuprates [6], Sr2RuO4[7], UGe2[8], and iron-based superconductors [9]. Those novel superconductors bring rich interesting physics and challenge our understanding of SC [10].

Recently, SC was discovered in a Cr-based family A_{2}Cr3As3 (A= K [11], Rb [12], and Cs [13]). The new materials possess a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) crystal structure characterized by infinite [(Cr3As3)2^{-}]_{\infty} linear chains, called double-walled subnanotubes, which are separated by alkali-metal cations. The point group is D_{3h}, hence there is no inversion center for the crystal structure. The superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} is 6.1, 4.8, and 2.2 K, respectively, for A= K, Rb, and Cs. Unconventional SC in K2Cr3As3 or Rb2Cr3As3 has been supported by accumulating experimental and theoretical results as follows. (1) The Sommerfeld specific-heat coefficient is nearly four times of the value from the first-principles calculation [14,15], indicating significant electron correlations in K2Cr3As3. (2) K2Cr3As3 shows a large upper critical field H_{\rm c2}, which exceeds the BCS weak-coupling Pauli limit [16,17], H_{\rm c2}^{\rm P}=18.4T_{\rm c}\approx 110 kOe, by 3-4 times [11,18,19]. (3) The ^{7}As nuclear quadrapole resonance (NQR) shows a strong enhancement of Cr-spin fluctuations above T_{\rm c} and, there is no Hebel-Slichter coherence peak in the temperature dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate just below T_{\rm c} for K2Cr3As3[20]. Similar result is given by the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for Rb2Cr3As3, from which _ferromagnetic_ spin fluctuations are additionally evidenced [21], supporting a spin-triplet pairing scenario. The latter seems to be consistent with the observation of a spontaneous internal magnetic field near T_{\rm c}, although being very weak, in the muon spin relaxation or rotation (\muSR) experiment [22]. (4) Penetration-depth measurements indicate existence of line nodes in the superconducting gap [23]. (5) Band-structure calculations show that Cr-3d orbitals dominate the electronic states at the Fermi level (E_{\rm F}) and, the consequent Fermi-surface sheets (FSs) consist of a three-dimensional (3D) FS in addition to two quasi-1D FSs [14,15,24]. Ferromagnetic and/or frustrated spin fluctuations are suggested by the calculations. (6) Theoretical models [25,26,27] are established based on the molecular orbitals, from which spin-triplet SC is stabilized. (7) The expected T_{\rm c} suppression by impurity scattering for non-s-wave superconductors is observed in the K2Cr3As3 crystals prepared using impure Cr [28].

As is known, the H_{\rm c2} behavior of a type-II superconductor may be an indicator for unconventional SC [29,30,31]. The temperature and angular dependence of H_{\rm c2} reflect the mechanisms of Cooper-pair breaking due to an orbital and/or Zeeman effect. H_{\rm c2}(T) data of K2Cr3As3 have been measured for different samples [11,18,19,32]. Measurements using single crystals revealed a large initial slope, -({\rm d}H_{\rm c2}/{\rm d}T)|_{T_{\rm c}}, of 120 [18] or 161 kOe/K [32], for field parallel to the crystallographic c axis (**H**\parallel c). H_{\rm c2}^{\rm P}(T) exhibits a strongly negative curvature, and it saturates at about 230 kOe, indicating a Pauli-limiting scenario with significant spin-orbit coupling [19]. On the other hand, the H_{\rm c2}^{\rm\perp}(T) data basically show an orbitally limited behavior with no signs of paramagnetic pair breaking. Consequently, H_{\rm c2}^{\rm\perp}(T) and H_{\rm c2}^{\rm\parallel}(T) cross at T\approx 4 K [19].

 To further understand the different behaviors of H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T) and H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T), we measured the H_{\mathrm{c2}}_in situ_ as functions of _the polar angle_\theta (the angle relative to the c axis), _the azimuthal angle_\phi (the angle relative to the [0\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolOhm}\] direction in the basal plane), as well as temperature T for K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} crystals. The extrapolated orbitally limited H_{\mathrm{c2}} for \mathbf{H}\parallel c and \mathbf{H}\bot c at zero temperature exceed the Pauli limit by a factor of 4.6 and 3.4, respectively, far beyond the scope of singlet pairing scenario. The H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\theta) data demonstrate that the apparent anisotropy reversal phenomenon is due to the paramagnetically pair-breaking effect _only for the field component parallel to the c axis_. The H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\theta) completely satisfy the equation based on the assumption of triplet Cooper pairing. Furthermore, the H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\phi) profile shows a unique threefold modulation, suggesting the coupling of a symmetry-breaking field. These results point to a dominant spin-triplet superconducting state in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}.

## II Experimental Methods

Rod-shape single crystals of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} were grown by a self-flux method [11]. The magnetoresistance was measured with a standard four-probe technique on a rotator under pulsed magnetic field that can reach 60 T. The four contacts were attached to 25-\mum diameter gold wires by using Dupont 4929N silver paint (examples photographed in Figs. S4 and S7 in Ref. [33]). The samples were mounted on the rotator probe with a sapphire substrate. All the procedures were done in an Ar-filled glove box. After transferring the probe from the glove box, we replaced Ar gas in the sample space with helium gas, which was served as exchanging gas. The electrical current was applied along the rod direction, which is always parallel to the crystallographic c axis because of the crystallization habit. The rotational axis is either perpendicular or parallel to the rod. So the magnetic field direction could be adjusted _in situ_. The angles (\theta and \phi) could be extracted from the ratio of a coil attached to the back of the rotating platform to the pick-up coil for field. Note that the sample was air-sensitive and could not be reused. We thus employed different samples for different measurements. Nevertheless, we checked that the results were reproducible.

## III Results and Discussion

### H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T,\theta) result

At zero field, the sample shows a sharp superconducting transition at T_{\mathrm{c}}=6.2 K, as shown in Fig. S1 in Ref. [33]. The residual resistance ratio (RRR), i.e., a ratio of the resistivity at room temperature and at the temperature just above T_{\mathrm{c}}, is about 60, indicating high-quality of the sample. Note that a small residual resistance is left below T_{\mathrm{c}}. This is probably due to the chemical reaction between sample and the silver-paste electrodes, which forms a non-superconducting KCr_{3}As_{3} phase [34]. Nevertheless, the partial deterioration of the sample does not affect the H_{\mathrm{c2}} determination because the onset transition temperature T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{onset}} value is not altered, compared with the previous reports [11, 18, 19, 32].

Field dependence of the magnetoresistance was employed to determine the H_{\mathrm{c2}} which is defined by the crossing point of the normal and superconducting states, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The resulting H_{\mathrm{c2}} data are plotted in Fig. 1(c). Here we note that defining the H_{\mathrm{c2}} as the peak position of the derivative of magnetoresistance does not change the result (see Figs. S2 and S3 in Ref. [33]). Overall, the obtained H_{\mathrm{c2}}-T phase diagram is similar to the previous profile [19], featured by the crossing of H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) and H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T). The "crossover" temperature is 3.1 K, somewhat lower than the value (\approx4 K) previously reported [19]. Apparently, the reversal in H_{\mathrm{c2}} anisotropy suggests a dimension crossover from uniaxial anisotropy to planar one (note that there are "K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}" atomic planes at z=0 and 1/2 in the crystal structure [11]). However, the H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\theta) data in Fig. 2 show modulations at the "crossover" temperature of 3.1 K, which is inconsistent with the expected angle dependence, H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\theta)\sim(\cos^{2}\theta+\epsilon^{2}\sin^{2}\theta)^{-1/2}, from which a constant H_{\mathrm{c2}} is concluded for the effective-mass ratio \epsilon^{2}=1. Even at 1.9 K, where H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}>H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}, a small peak at \theta=0^{\circ} is present. This indicates that the uniaxial anisotropy is still there, and thus the dimension-crossover scenario can be ruled out.

The phenomenon of crossing of H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) and H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T), although being uncommon, was reported in several other systems including the quasi-1D organic superconductor (TMTSF)_{2}PF_{6}[35], iron-based chalcogenides [36, 37, 38], and the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt_{3}[39]. Nevertheless, details of the H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T) crossing, which reflect the origin of the anisotropy reversal, differ from each other. In the organic superconductor (TMTSF)_{2}PF_{6}, H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T) displays pronounced upward curvature without saturation for two field directions perpendicular to \epsilon^{*} at low temperatures [35]. This feature can be explained in terms of dramatic reduction of orbitally pair-breaking effect because of a field-induced dimension crossover [31]. As for iron-based superconductors, the anisotropy inversion appears accidentally (thus it is not ubiquitous) and, they tend to be isotropic (the anisotropy ratio approaches 1.0) at T\to 0. The H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T) data reveal that Pauli-limiting effect is at work regardless of the field directions [37, 40], consistent with spin-singlet Cooper pairing. In the case of UPt_{3}, by contrast, the reversed anisotropy is appreciable at zero temperature, and more importantly, Pauli-limiting effect is absent for \mathbf{H}\bot c. This observation leads to a proposal of triplet SC with odd parity in UPt_{3}[41].

The case in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} mostly resembles that of UPt_{3}, yet it is qualitatively different from those of iron-based superconductors. As can be seen in Fig. 1(c), H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T) shows negative curvatures, and it saturates at lower temperatures, consistent with a dominant paramagnetically pair-breaking scenario. In contrast, H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) basically shows a linear behavior with a slightly positive curvature, or, a kink at about 5.5 K. Furthermore, below 3 K, H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) values surpass H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T) significantly, achieving 270 kOe at 1.7 K, or 370 kOe at 0.6 K [19], which are 2.5 and 3.4 times of the Pauli limit. These data clearly indicate that, for H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T), paramagnetically pair-breaking effect is minor at most and, therefore, orbitally pair-breaking effect turn out to be dominant. Indeed, the data fit using Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory [42] for a uniaxial, single-gap superconductor shows that the Pauli pair-breaking parameter is zero for H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T)[19]. Therefore the crossing of H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T) and H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} comes from different pair-breaking mechanisms for the different external field directions, an extremely  anisotropic Pauli-limiting effect, in contrast with the dominant Pauli-limiting scenario in iron-based superconductors [37, 40].

The anisotropic Pauli-limiting character manifests itself in the H_{\rm c2}(\theta) data, as shown in Fig. 2.

Nearby T_{\rm c}, H_{\rm c2} decreases monotonously as the field direction is tilted from {\bf H}\|c. This can be understood in terms of a uniaxial effective-mass anisotropy in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. As the temperature is decreased, an additional maximum in H_{\rm c2}(\theta) appears at \theta=\pi/2, consistent with the _absence_ of Pauli-limiting effect for {\bf H}\bot c. Below we show that the whole H_{\rm c2}(\theta) data set can be perfectly explained by the combination of a _fully_ anisotropic Pauli-limiting effect with a uniaxial effective-mass anisotropy.

First of all, according to GL theory, the effective-mass anisotropy leads to the anisotropy of the orbitally limited H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}(\theta),

\[H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}(\theta)=\frac{H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}}{\sqrt{\cos ^{2}\!\theta+\epsilon^{2}\sin^{2}\!\theta}},\] (1)

where H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb} denotes the presumed orbitally limited upper critical field for {\bf H}\|c and, \epsilon^{2}=m_{\perp}/m_{\parallel}=(H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}/H_{\rm c 2,\perp}

  Pauli-limiting field H_{\rm pm}. Since only the magnetic-field component parallel to c axis further suppresses the H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}(\theta) in Eq. (1), H_{\rm pm} is then given by H_{\rm pm}(\theta)=H_{\rm pm}^{\parallel}{\rm cos}\theta, such that H_{\rm pm}(\theta)=H_{\rm pm}^{\parallel} (full Pauli limiting) for \theta=0 and, H_{\rm pm}(\theta)=0 (absence of Pauli limiting) for \theta=\pi/2.

The effective Pauli-limiting field H_{\rm pm} suppresses H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb} in a way of competition between the related energies [16; 17; 42; 43]. Given E\sim H^{2}, therefore, [H_{\rm c2}(\theta)]^{2}=[H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}(\theta)]^{2}-[H_{\rm pm}(\theta )]^{2}. Consequently, one obtains an explicit expression for H_{\rm c2}(\theta),

\[H_{\rm c2}(\theta)=\sqrt{\frac{\left(H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}\right)^{2 }}{{\rm cos}^{2}\theta+\epsilon^{2}{\rm sin}^{2}\theta}-(H_{\rm pm}^{\parallel }{\rm cos}\theta)^{2}}.\] (2)

Remarkably, the whole experimental data set of H_{\rm c2}(\theta,T) satisfies the above equation very well, as shown in Fig. 2, which further confirms the absence of Pauli-limiting effect for {\bf H}\bot c. The data fitting yields three parameters, H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}, \epsilon and H_{\rm pm}^{\parallel} at a given temperature. As expected, the fitted H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(T) is basically linear, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The linear extrapolation yields a zero-temperature orbitally limited H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(0) of 515 kOe for {\bf H}\parallel c, which is reasonably larger than the extrapolated value of H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}(0)=372 kOe for {\bf H}\bot c (experimentally, H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}=370 kOe at 0.6 K [19]). The obtained H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(0) and H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}(0) exceed the Pauli limit H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb} by a factor of 4.6 and 3.4, respectively. Using the GL relations, H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(0)=\Phi_{0}/[2\pi\xi_{\perp}(0)^{2}] and H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}(0)=\Phi_{0}/[2\pi\xi_{\perp}(0)\xi_{\parallel}(0)], where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum, the anisotropic coherence lengths at zero temperature can be estimated to be \xi_{\perp}(0)=2.53 nm and \xi_{\parallel}(0)=3.50 nm. The \xi_{\perp}(0) value exceeds twice of the interchain distance in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[11], indicating a uniaxially anisotropic 3D SC.

Figure 1(d) plots the anisotropic parameters, \gamma_{H}(T), \gamma_{H}(T)^{\rm orb} [=H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(T)/H_{\rm c2}^{\perp}(T)] and \epsilon(T). They tend to emerge at about 5 K. \gamma_{H}(T) shows a divergence behavior at temperatures close to T_{\rm c}, implying the relevance of quasi-1D scenario to the emergence of SC. At 5.8 K, \gamma_{H} is 3.3, corresponding to a effective-mass ratio of m_{\perp}/m_{\parallel}\sim 11, which virtually reflects the obviously uniaxial anisotropy due to the quasi-1D crystal and electronic structures. Upon cooling down, \gamma_{H}(T) decreases rapidly and, it crosses the isotropic line of \gamma_{H}(T)=1.0, which was referred to as an "anisotropy reversal" [19]. However, \gamma_{H}(T)^{\rm orb} and \epsilon(T) do not cross the \gamma_{H}(T)=1.0 line, which means that the anisotropy reversal would _disappears_ if the anisotropic Pauli-limiting effect were not involved. Indeed, \gamma_{H}(T)^{\rm orb} and \epsilon(T) saturate at 1.4 down to lower temperatures, consistent with the 3D SC concluded above.

### H_{\rm c2}(\phi) result

The similarity of H_{\rm c2}(T,\theta) between K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and UPt_{3} motivates us to measure H_{\rm c2} as a function of the azimuthal angle \phi, since the latter superconductor exhibits a sixfold modulation in the in-plane H_{\rm c2}(\phi)[44]. Figure 3 shows derivative of the magnetoresistance for the field directions with different \phi angles, from which the H_{\rm c2}(\phi) can be determined by the peak value in dR/dH (the peak values and their error bars were extracted by a Gaussian fit). This definition is consistent with the former one for the out-of-plane H_{\rm c2}(\theta), which is shown in SM. The \phi angle varied from 1.87^{\circ} to 153.38^{\circ}. To plot a complete polar diagram, the data were rotated by 120^{\circ} and -120^{\circ}, respectively, according to the crystal symmetry with the point group of D_{\rm M}. The overlapped region validates the rotation. Consequently, the obtained H_{\rm c2}(\phi) profile shows a three-fold (quasi-six-fold) modulation with an amplitude of 3.6 kOe. The maximum of H_{\rm c2}(\phi) appears for the field directions along the crystallographic a and b axes. We can exclude the possibility of surface superconductivity and the influence of anisotropic normal-state magnetoresistance (see Ref. [33] for the details). At a higher temperature of 4.23 K, the in-plane anisotropy magnitude decreases obviously (0.5 kOe), nevertheless, similar threefold modulation is still observable with the maximum basically along the a axis, as shown in Figs. S6 and S9 in Ref. [33]. Note that the H_{\rm c2}(\phi) modulation (with a relative magnitude up to \sim1.2%) in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is actually more obvious than those in UPt_{3}[44] and MgB_{2}[45], both of which also crystallize in a hexagonal lattice.

The sixfold modulation of H_{\rm c2}(\phi) in UPt_{3} can be explained in terms of a coupling to the symmetry breaking field [46]. Neutron diffraction study for UPt_{3} indeed shows an antiferromagnetism whose moments are lying within the basal plane

(b) Polar plot of the extracted H_{\rm c2}(\phi). The red (blue) triangles come from the rotation of the derived data with \phi_{r}=120^{\circ} (-120^{\circ}), respectively. Shown at the lower-right corner is the possible Cr_{6}-octohedron spin configuration for the magnetic ground state, according to first-principles calculations.

  [47]. In the case of K2Cr3As3, according to the first-principles calculations, it is nearby an in-out co-planar magnetic ground state [14, 15], shown at the lower-right corner in Fig. 3(b), in which the magnetic moments lie in the basal plane. This result seems to be compatible with the observed H_{\rm c2}(\phi) modulation that can be similarly explained by the coupling to the symmetry breaking field [46]. Given the relatively small magnitude which tends to decrease when approaching T_{\rm c}, alternatively, the H_{\rm c2}(\phi) anisotropy may also reflect the symmetry of crystalline lattice. It was shown that weak in-plane modulations of H_{\rm c2}(\phi) can be resulted from the GL theory incorporating higher-order gradient terms [48, 49], particularly for a periodic array of weakly-coupled superconducting filaments [50] which seems to be relevant to K2Cr3As3.

### Discussion

For a conventional superconductor with a high H_{\rm c2}(0) comparable to H_{\rm c2}^{\rm p}, the H_{\rm c2}(0) value is normally limited by paramagnetic effect regardless of field directions. Considering the paramagnetically limited behavior of H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(T) in K2Cr3As3, as well as the preliminary observation of insensitivity of T_{\rm c} on impurity scattering, Balakirev _et al._[19] proposed a novel spin-singlet superconductivity. The absence of Pauli-limiting effect for {\bf H}_{\perp}c is explained by assuming electron-spin locking along the c direction.

The absence of Pauli-limiting effect for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(T) and a large H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(0) value (3.4 times of H_{\rm c2}^{\rm p}) also dictate a spin-triplet pairing scenario, as in the case of UPt3 (see Table I in Ref. [33] for the comparison) that was recently confirmed to host a spin-triplet odd-parity SC [51, 52]. The (pseudo)spins of the odd-parity Cooper pairs are \uparrow\downarrow)+\downarrow\downarrow\uparrow with S_{z}=0, which is equivalent to the spin state of \left|\leftarrow\right\rangle+\left|\rightarrow\right\rangle. In this circumstance, the Zeeman energy breaks the Cooper pairs for {\bf H}\left|\downarrow\right|, hence the Pauli-limiting behavior for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(T). By contrast, the perpendicular field simply changes the population of Cooper pairs with spin directions \left|\leftarrow\right\rangle and \left|\rightarrow\right\rangle, and therefore, no paramagnetic pair-breaking is expected for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(T). Indeed, by taking spin-triplet Cooper pairs into consideration, and with some simplifications and approximations, we are able to derive an equation for H_{\rm c2}(\theta), whose solution is consistent with Eq. (2) (see Ref. [33] for details). Here we note that, owing to the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure in K2Cr3As3, the pairing symmetry is in principle a mixture of singlet and triplet states [25], except for the case of simple p_{z} wave in which a purely triplet pairing is anticipated because of the mirror-plane reflection symmetry [26].

Finally, we comment on the impurity scattering effect on T_{\rm c}, which is important to judge the possibility of either singlet or triplet pairing state. For an odd-parity unconventional superconductor, nonmagnetic scattering serves as a source of pair breaking even at zero field, hence T_{\rm c} suppression is expected. Note here that, however, such an effect will not be evident in the clean-limit regime, i.e., the electron mean free path l is much larger than the superconducting coherence length \xi. In K2Cr3As3, l is estimated to be \sim75 nm (after the electron-mass renormalization is considered) for the electron transport along the c axis in the sample with RRR = 61 (see Ref. [33]), and \xi_{\parallel}(0) is only 3.5 nm, thus l\gg\xi holds. This explains why the T_{\rm c} keeps almost unchanged for single-crystal samples with different RRRs. Our recent study shows that, when introducing sufficient impurities (l\sim\xi), T_{\rm c} is indeed suppressed in K2Cr3As3 [28].

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, we have performed detailed H_{\rm c2}(\theta,\phi,T) measurements on superconducting K2Cr3As3 crystals. We confirm the "anisotropy-reversal" phenomenon which reflects different pair-breaking mechanisms for different magnetic-field directions. The absence of paramagnetic pair breaking for {\bf H}\bot c is further demonstrated by the H_{\rm c2}(\theta) data set. The extracted values of H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(0) and H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}(0) (515 and 372 kOe, respectively) far exceed the Pauli limit. We also observe a three-fold modulation in H_{\rm c2}(\phi). While the spin structure of the superconducting Cooper pairs cannot be definitely determined by the results above, spin-locking scenario should be essential. We argue that a dominant spin-triplet pairing is more natural to meet the experimental data. Note that the spin-triplet pairing is consistent with the previous implications/suggestions in experimental and theoretical studies [14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27]. We hope our result helps to find the exact superconducting order parameter in K2Cr3As3, which might expand the overall understanding of unconventional superconductivity.

###### Abstract

We report measurements of the upper critical field H_{\rm c2} as functions of temperature T, polar angle \theta (of the field direction with respect to the crystallographic c axis), and azimuthal angle \phi (of the field direction relative to the a axis within the ab plane) for the Cr-based superconductor K2Cr3As3 with a quasi-one-dimensional and noncentrosymmetric crystal structure. We confirm that the anisotropy in H_{\rm c2}(T) becomes inverse with decreasing temperature. At low temperatures, H_{\rm c2}(\theta) data are featured by two maxima at \theta=0 (**H**\mid c) and \pi/2 (**H**\perp c), which can be quantitatively understood only if uniaxial effective-mass anisotropy and absence of Pauli paramagnetic effect for **H\perp c** are taken simultaneously into consideration. The in-plane H_{\rm c2}(\theta) profile shows a unique threefold modulation especially at low temperatures. Overall, the characteristics of the H_{\rm c2}(\theta,\phi,T) data mostly resemble those of the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt3, and we argue in favor of a dominant spin-triplet superconductivity with odd parity in K2Cr3As3.

## 1 Introduction

Unconventional superconductors are those materials that possess exotic superconductivity (SC) whose origin cannot be explained by electron-phonon interactions in Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [1]. A more operable description for unconventional superconductors addresses an additional symmetry broken [2], apart from the U(1)-gauge symmetry and crystalline-lattice symmetry. Examples of unconventional superconductors include, chronologically, CeCu2Si2[3], organic superconductors [4], UPt3[5], high-T_{\rm c} cuprates [6], Sr2RuO4[7], UGe2[8], and iron-based superconductors [9]. Those novel superconductors bring rich interesting physics and challenge our understanding of SC [10].

Recently, SC was discovered in a Cr-based family A_{2}Cr3As3 (A= K [11], Rb [12], and Cs [13]). The new materials possess a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) crystal structure characterized by infinite [(Cr3As3)2^{-}]_{\infty} linear chains, called double-walled subnanotubes, which are separated by alkali-metal cations. The point group is D_{3h}, hence there is no inversion center for the crystal structure. The superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} is 6.1, 4.8, and 2.2 K, respectively, for A= K, Rb, and Cs. Unconventional SC in K2Cr3As3 or Rb2Cr3As3 has been supported by accumulating experimental and theoretical results as follows. (1) The Sommerfeld specific-heat coefficient is nearly four times of the value from the first-principles calculation [14,15], indicating significant electron correlations in K2Cr3As3. (2) K2Cr3As3 shows a large upper critical field H_{\rm c2}, which exceeds the BCS weak-coupling Pauli limit [16,17], H_{\rm c2}^{\rm P}=18.4T_{\rm c}\approx 110 kOe, by 3-4 times [11,18,19]. (3) The ^{7}As nuclear quadrapole resonance (NQR) shows a strong enhancement of Cr-spin fluctuations above T_{\rm c} and, there is no Hebel-Slichter coherence peak in the temperature dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate just below T_{\rm c} for K2Cr3As3[20]. Similar result is given by the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for Rb2Cr3As3, from which _ferromagnetic_ spin fluctuations are additionally evidenced [21], supporting a spin-triplet pairing scenario. The latter seems to be consistent with the observation of a spontaneous internal magnetic field near T_{\rm c}, although being very weak, in the muon spin relaxation or rotation (\muSR) experiment [22]. (4) Penetration-depth measurements indicate existence of line nodes in the superconducting gap [23]. (5) Band-structure calculations show that Cr-3d orbitals dominate the electronic states at the Fermi level (E_{\rm F}) and, the consequent Fermi-surface sheets (FSs) consist of a three-dimensional (3D) FS in addition to two quasi-1D FSs [14,15,24]. Ferromagnetic and/or frustrated spin fluctuations are suggested by the calculations. (6) Theoretical models [25,26,27] are established based on the molecular orbitals, from which spin-triplet SC is stabilized. (7) The expected T_{\rm c} suppression by impurity scattering for non-s-wave superconductors is observed in the K2Cr3As3 crystals prepared using impure Cr [28].

As is known, the H_{\rm c2} behavior of a type-II superconductor may be an indicator for unconventional SC [29,30,31]. The temperature and angular dependence of H_{\rm c2} reflect the mechanisms of Cooper-pair breaking due to an orbital and/or Zeeman effect. H_{\rm c2}(T) data of K2Cr3As3 have been measured for different samples [11,18,19,32]. Measurements using single crystals revealed a large initial slope, -({\rm d}H_{\rm c2}/{\rm d}T)|_{T_{\rm c}}, of 120 [18] or 161 kOe/K [32], for field parallel to the crystallographic c axis (**H**\parallel c). H_{\rm c2}^{\rm P}(T) exhibits a strongly negative curvature, and it saturates at about 230 kOe, indicating a Pauli-limiting scenario with significant spin-orbit coupling [19]. On the other hand, the H_{\rm c2}^{\rm\perp}(T) data basically show an orbitally limited behavior with no signs of paramagnetic pair breaking. Consequently, H_{\rm c2}^{\rm\perp}(T) and H_{\rm c2}^{\rm\parallel}(T) cross at T\approx 4 K [19].

 To further understand the different behaviors of H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T) and H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T), we measured the H_{\mathrm{c2}}_in situ_ as functions of _the polar angle_\theta (the angle relative to the c axis), _the azimuthal angle_\phi (the angle relative to the [0\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro}\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolOhm}\] direction in the basal plane), as well as temperature T for K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} crystals. The extrapolated orbitally limited H_{\mathrm{c2}} for \mathbf{H}\parallel c and \mathbf{H}\bot c at zero temperature exceed the Pauli limit by a factor of 4.6 and 3.4, respectively, far beyond the scope of singlet pairing scenario. The H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\theta) data demonstrate that the apparent anisotropy reversal phenomenon is due to the paramagnetically pair-breaking effect _only for the field component parallel to the c axis_. The H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\theta) completely satisfy the equation based on the assumption of triplet Cooper pairing. Furthermore, the H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\phi) profile shows a unique threefold modulation, suggesting the coupling of a symmetry-breaking field. These results point to a dominant spin-triplet superconducting state in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}.

## II Experimental Methods

Rod-shape single crystals of K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} were grown by a self-flux method [11]. The magnetoresistance was measured with a standard four-probe technique on a rotator under pulsed magnetic field that can reach 60 T. The four contacts were attached to 25-\mum diameter gold wires by using Dupont 4929N silver paint (examples photographed in Figs. S4 and S7 in Ref. [33]). The samples were mounted on the rotator probe with a sapphire substrate. All the procedures were done in an Ar-filled glove box. After transferring the probe from the glove box, we replaced Ar gas in the sample space with helium gas, which was served as exchanging gas. The electrical current was applied along the rod direction, which is always parallel to the crystallographic c axis because of the crystallization habit. The rotational axis is either perpendicular or parallel to the rod. So the magnetic field direction could be adjusted _in situ_. The angles (\theta and \phi) could be extracted from the ratio of a coil attached to the back of the rotating platform to the pick-up coil for field. Note that the sample was air-sensitive and could not be reused. We thus employed different samples for different measurements. Nevertheless, we checked that the results were reproducible.

## III Results and Discussion

### H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T,\theta) result

At zero field, the sample shows a sharp superconducting transition at T_{\mathrm{c}}=6.2 K, as shown in Fig. S1 in Ref. [33]. The residual resistance ratio (RRR), i.e., a ratio of the resistivity at room temperature and at the temperature just above T_{\mathrm{c}}, is about 60, indicating high-quality of the sample. Note that a small residual resistance is left below T_{\mathrm{c}}. This is probably due to the chemical reaction between sample and the silver-paste electrodes, which forms a non-superconducting KCr_{3}As_{3} phase [34]. Nevertheless, the partial deterioration of the sample does not affect the H_{\mathrm{c2}} determination because the onset transition temperature T_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{onset}} value is not altered, compared with the previous reports [11, 18, 19, 32].

Field dependence of the magnetoresistance was employed to determine the H_{\mathrm{c2}} which is defined by the crossing point of the normal and superconducting states, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The resulting H_{\mathrm{c2}} data are plotted in Fig. 1(c). Here we note that defining the H_{\mathrm{c2}} as the peak position of the derivative of magnetoresistance does not change the result (see Figs. S2 and S3 in Ref. [33]). Overall, the obtained H_{\mathrm{c2}}-T phase diagram is similar to the previous profile [19], featured by the crossing of H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) and H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T). The "crossover" temperature is 3.1 K, somewhat lower than the value (\approx4 K) previously reported [19]. Apparently, the reversal in H_{\mathrm{c2}} anisotropy suggests a dimension crossover from uniaxial anisotropy to planar one (note that there are "K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}" atomic planes at z=0 and 1/2 in the crystal structure [11]). However, the H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\theta) data in Fig. 2 show modulations at the "crossover" temperature of 3.1 K, which is inconsistent with the expected angle dependence, H_{\mathrm{c2}}(\theta)\sim(\cos^{2}\theta+\epsilon^{2}\sin^{2}\theta)^{-1/2}, from which a constant H_{\mathrm{c2}} is concluded for the effective-mass ratio \epsilon^{2}=1. Even at 1.9 K, where H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}>H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}, a small peak at \theta=0^{\circ} is present. This indicates that the uniaxial anisotropy is still there, and thus the dimension-crossover scenario can be ruled out.

The phenomenon of crossing of H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) and H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T), although being uncommon, was reported in several other systems including the quasi-1D organic superconductor (TMTSF)_{2}PF_{6}[35], iron-based chalcogenides [36, 37, 38], and the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt_{3}[39]. Nevertheless, details of the H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T) crossing, which reflect the origin of the anisotropy reversal, differ from each other. In the organic superconductor (TMTSF)_{2}PF_{6}, H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T) displays pronounced upward curvature without saturation for two field directions perpendicular to \epsilon^{*} at low temperatures [35]. This feature can be explained in terms of dramatic reduction of orbitally pair-breaking effect because of a field-induced dimension crossover [31]. As for iron-based superconductors, the anisotropy inversion appears accidentally (thus it is not ubiquitous) and, they tend to be isotropic (the anisotropy ratio approaches 1.0) at T\to 0. The H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T) data reveal that Pauli-limiting effect is at work regardless of the field directions [37, 40], consistent with spin-singlet Cooper pairing. In the case of UPt_{3}, by contrast, the reversed anisotropy is appreciable at zero temperature, and more importantly, Pauli-limiting effect is absent for \mathbf{H}\bot c. This observation leads to a proposal of triplet SC with odd parity in UPt_{3}[41].

The case in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} mostly resembles that of UPt_{3}, yet it is qualitatively different from those of iron-based superconductors. As can be seen in Fig. 1(c), H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T) shows negative curvatures, and it saturates at lower temperatures, consistent with a dominant paramagnetically pair-breaking scenario. In contrast, H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) basically shows a linear behavior with a slightly positive curvature, or, a kink at about 5.5 K. Furthermore, below 3 K, H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) values surpass H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T) significantly, achieving 270 kOe at 1.7 K, or 370 kOe at 0.6 K [19], which are 2.5 and 3.4 times of the Pauli limit. These data clearly indicate that, for H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T), paramagnetically pair-breaking effect is minor at most and, therefore, orbitally pair-breaking effect turn out to be dominant. Indeed, the data fit using Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory [42] for a uniaxial, single-gap superconductor shows that the Pauli pair-breaking parameter is zero for H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T)[19]. Therefore the crossing of H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\parallel}(T) and H_{\mathrm{c2}}^{\perp}(T) in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} comes from different pair-breaking mechanisms for the different external field directions, an extremely  anisotropic Pauli-limiting effect, in contrast with the dominant Pauli-limiting scenario in iron-based superconductors [37, 40].

The anisotropic Pauli-limiting character manifests itself in the H_{\rm c2}(\theta) data, as shown in Fig. 2.

Nearby T_{\rm c}, H_{\rm c2} decreases monotonously as the field direction is tilted from {\bf H}\|c. This can be understood in terms of a uniaxial effective-mass anisotropy in Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. As the temperature is decreased, an additional maximum in H_{\rm c2}(\theta) appears at \theta=\pi/2, consistent with the _absence_ of Pauli-limiting effect for {\bf H}\bot c. Below we show that the whole H_{\rm c2}(\theta) data set can be perfectly explained by the combination of a _fully_ anisotropic Pauli-limiting effect with a uniaxial effective-mass anisotropy.

First of all, according to GL theory, the effective-mass anisotropy leads to the anisotropy of the orbitally limited H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}(\theta),

\[H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}(\theta)=\frac{H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}}{\sqrt{\cos ^{2}\!\theta+\epsilon^{2}\sin^{2}\!\theta}},\] (1)

where H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb} denotes the presumed orbitally limited upper critical field for {\bf H}\|c and, \epsilon^{2}=m_{\perp}/m_{\parallel}=(H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}/H_{\rm c 2,\perp}

  Pauli-limiting field H_{\rm pm}. Since only the magnetic-field component parallel to c axis further suppresses the H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}(\theta) in Eq. (1), H_{\rm pm} is then given by H_{\rm pm}(\theta)=H_{\rm pm}^{\parallel}{\rm cos}\theta, such that H_{\rm pm}(\theta)=H_{\rm pm}^{\parallel} (full Pauli limiting) for \theta=0 and, H_{\rm pm}(\theta)=0 (absence of Pauli limiting) for \theta=\pi/2.

The effective Pauli-limiting field H_{\rm pm} suppresses H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb} in a way of competition between the related energies [16; 17; 42; 43]. Given E\sim H^{2}, therefore, [H_{\rm c2}(\theta)]^{2}=[H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb}(\theta)]^{2}-[H_{\rm pm}(\theta )]^{2}. Consequently, one obtains an explicit expression for H_{\rm c2}(\theta),

\[H_{\rm c2}(\theta)=\sqrt{\frac{\left(H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}\right)^{2 }}{{\rm cos}^{2}\theta+\epsilon^{2}{\rm sin}^{2}\theta}-(H_{\rm pm}^{\parallel }{\rm cos}\theta)^{2}}.\] (2)

Remarkably, the whole experimental data set of H_{\rm c2}(\theta,T) satisfies the above equation very well, as shown in Fig. 2, which further confirms the absence of Pauli-limiting effect for {\bf H}\bot c. The data fitting yields three parameters, H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}, \epsilon and H_{\rm pm}^{\parallel} at a given temperature. As expected, the fitted H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(T) is basically linear, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The linear extrapolation yields a zero-temperature orbitally limited H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(0) of 515 kOe for {\bf H}\parallel c, which is reasonably larger than the extrapolated value of H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}(0)=372 kOe for {\bf H}\bot c (experimentally, H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}=370 kOe at 0.6 K [19]). The obtained H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(0) and H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}(0) exceed the Pauli limit H_{\rm c2}^{\rm orb} by a factor of 4.6 and 3.4, respectively. Using the GL relations, H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(0)=\Phi_{0}/[2\pi\xi_{\perp}(0)^{2}] and H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}(0)=\Phi_{0}/[2\pi\xi_{\perp}(0)\xi_{\parallel}(0)], where \Phi_{0} is the flux quantum, the anisotropic coherence lengths at zero temperature can be estimated to be \xi_{\perp}(0)=2.53 nm and \xi_{\parallel}(0)=3.50 nm. The \xi_{\perp}(0) value exceeds twice of the interchain distance in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3}[11], indicating a uniaxially anisotropic 3D SC.

Figure 1(d) plots the anisotropic parameters, \gamma_{H}(T), \gamma_{H}(T)^{\rm orb} [=H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(T)/H_{\rm c2}^{\perp}(T)] and \epsilon(T). They tend to emerge at about 5 K. \gamma_{H}(T) shows a divergence behavior at temperatures close to T_{\rm c}, implying the relevance of quasi-1D scenario to the emergence of SC. At 5.8 K, \gamma_{H} is 3.3, corresponding to a effective-mass ratio of m_{\perp}/m_{\parallel}\sim 11, which virtually reflects the obviously uniaxial anisotropy due to the quasi-1D crystal and electronic structures. Upon cooling down, \gamma_{H}(T) decreases rapidly and, it crosses the isotropic line of \gamma_{H}(T)=1.0, which was referred to as an "anisotropy reversal" [19]. However, \gamma_{H}(T)^{\rm orb} and \epsilon(T) do not cross the \gamma_{H}(T)=1.0 line, which means that the anisotropy reversal would _disappears_ if the anisotropic Pauli-limiting effect were not involved. Indeed, \gamma_{H}(T)^{\rm orb} and \epsilon(T) saturate at 1.4 down to lower temperatures, consistent with the 3D SC concluded above.

### H_{\rm c2}(\phi) result

The similarity of H_{\rm c2}(T,\theta) between K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} and UPt_{3} motivates us to measure H_{\rm c2} as a function of the azimuthal angle \phi, since the latter superconductor exhibits a sixfold modulation in the in-plane H_{\rm c2}(\phi)[44]. Figure 3 shows derivative of the magnetoresistance for the field directions with different \phi angles, from which the H_{\rm c2}(\phi) can be determined by the peak value in dR/dH (the peak values and their error bars were extracted by a Gaussian fit). This definition is consistent with the former one for the out-of-plane H_{\rm c2}(\theta), which is shown in SM. The \phi angle varied from 1.87^{\circ} to 153.38^{\circ}. To plot a complete polar diagram, the data were rotated by 120^{\circ} and -120^{\circ}, respectively, according to the crystal symmetry with the point group of D_{\rm M}. The overlapped region validates the rotation. Consequently, the obtained H_{\rm c2}(\phi) profile shows a three-fold (quasi-six-fold) modulation with an amplitude of 3.6 kOe. The maximum of H_{\rm c2}(\phi) appears for the field directions along the crystallographic a and b axes. We can exclude the possibility of surface superconductivity and the influence of anisotropic normal-state magnetoresistance (see Ref. [33] for the details). At a higher temperature of 4.23 K, the in-plane anisotropy magnitude decreases obviously (0.5 kOe), nevertheless, similar threefold modulation is still observable with the maximum basically along the a axis, as shown in Figs. S6 and S9 in Ref. [33]. Note that the H_{\rm c2}(\phi) modulation (with a relative magnitude up to \sim1.2%) in K_{2}Cr_{3}As_{3} is actually more obvious than those in UPt_{3}[44] and MgB_{2}[45], both of which also crystallize in a hexagonal lattice.

The sixfold modulation of H_{\rm c2}(\phi) in UPt_{3} can be explained in terms of a coupling to the symmetry breaking field [46]. Neutron diffraction study for UPt_{3} indeed shows an antiferromagnetism whose moments are lying within the basal plane

(b) Polar plot of the extracted H_{\rm c2}(\phi). The red (blue) triangles come from the rotation of the derived data with \phi_{r}=120^{\circ} (-120^{\circ}), respectively. Shown at the lower-right corner is the possible Cr_{6}-octohedron spin configuration for the magnetic ground state, according to first-principles calculations.

  [47]. In the case of K2Cr3As3, according to the first-principles calculations, it is nearby an in-out co-planar magnetic ground state [14, 15], shown at the lower-right corner in Fig. 3(b), in which the magnetic moments lie in the basal plane. This result seems to be compatible with the observed H_{\rm c2}(\phi) modulation that can be similarly explained by the coupling to the symmetry breaking field [46]. Given the relatively small magnitude which tends to decrease when approaching T_{\rm c}, alternatively, the H_{\rm c2}(\phi) anisotropy may also reflect the symmetry of crystalline lattice. It was shown that weak in-plane modulations of H_{\rm c2}(\phi) can be resulted from the GL theory incorporating higher-order gradient terms [48, 49], particularly for a periodic array of weakly-coupled superconducting filaments [50] which seems to be relevant to K2Cr3As3.

### Discussion

For a conventional superconductor with a high H_{\rm c2}(0) comparable to H_{\rm c2}^{\rm p}, the H_{\rm c2}(0) value is normally limited by paramagnetic effect regardless of field directions. Considering the paramagnetically limited behavior of H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(T) in K2Cr3As3, as well as the preliminary observation of insensitivity of T_{\rm c} on impurity scattering, Balakirev _et al._[19] proposed a novel spin-singlet superconductivity. The absence of Pauli-limiting effect for {\bf H}_{\perp}c is explained by assuming electron-spin locking along the c direction.

The absence of Pauli-limiting effect for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(T) and a large H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(0) value (3.4 times of H_{\rm c2}^{\rm p}) also dictate a spin-triplet pairing scenario, as in the case of UPt3 (see Table I in Ref. [33] for the comparison) that was recently confirmed to host a spin-triplet odd-parity SC [51, 52]. The (pseudo)spins of the odd-parity Cooper pairs are \uparrow\downarrow)+\downarrow\downarrow\uparrow with S_{z}=0, which is equivalent to the spin state of \left|\leftarrow\right\rangle+\left|\rightarrow\right\rangle. In this circumstance, the Zeeman energy breaks the Cooper pairs for {\bf H}\left|\downarrow\right|, hence the Pauli-limiting behavior for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(T). By contrast, the perpendicular field simply changes the population of Cooper pairs with spin directions \left|\leftarrow\right\rangle and \left|\rightarrow\right\rangle, and therefore, no paramagnetic pair-breaking is expected for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm l}(T). Indeed, by taking spin-triplet Cooper pairs into consideration, and with some simplifications and approximations, we are able to derive an equation for H_{\rm c2}(\theta), whose solution is consistent with Eq. (2) (see Ref. [33] for details). Here we note that, owing to the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure in K2Cr3As3, the pairing symmetry is in principle a mixture of singlet and triplet states [25], except for the case of simple p_{z} wave in which a purely triplet pairing is anticipated because of the mirror-plane reflection symmetry [26].

Finally, we comment on the impurity scattering effect on T_{\rm c}, which is important to judge the possibility of either singlet or triplet pairing state. For an odd-parity unconventional superconductor, nonmagnetic scattering serves as a source of pair breaking even at zero field, hence T_{\rm c} suppression is expected. Note here that, however, such an effect will not be evident in the clean-limit regime, i.e., the electron mean free path l is much larger than the superconducting coherence length \xi. In K2Cr3As3, l is estimated to be \sim75 nm (after the electron-mass renormalization is considered) for the electron transport along the c axis in the sample with RRR = 61 (see Ref. [33]), and \xi_{\parallel}(0) is only 3.5 nm, thus l\gg\xi holds. This explains why the T_{\rm c} keeps almost unchanged for single-crystal samples with different RRRs. Our recent study shows that, when introducing sufficient impurities (l\sim\xi), T_{\rm c} is indeed suppressed in K2Cr3As3 [28].

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, we have performed detailed H_{\rm c2}(\theta,\phi,T) measurements on superconducting K2Cr3As3 crystals. We confirm the "anisotropy-reversal" phenomenon which reflects different pair-breaking mechanisms for different magnetic-field directions. The absence of paramagnetic pair breaking for {\bf H}\bot c is further demonstrated by the H_{\rm c2}(\theta) data set. The extracted values of H_{\rm c2,\parallel}^{\rm orb}(0) and H_{\rm c2,\perp}^{\rm orb}(0) (515 and 372 kOe, respectively) far exceed the Pauli limit. We also observe a three-fold modulation in H_{\rm c2}(\phi). While the spin structure of the superconducting Cooper pairs cannot be definitely determined by the results above, spin-locking scenario should be essential. We argue that a dominant spin-triplet pairing is more natural to meet the experimental data. Note that the spin-triplet pairing is consistent with the previous implications/suggestions in experimental and theoretical studies [14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27]. We hope our result helps to find the exact superconducting order parameter in K2Cr3As3, which might expand the overall understanding of unconventional superconductivity.
