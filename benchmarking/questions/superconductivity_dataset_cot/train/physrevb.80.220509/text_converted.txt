###### Abstract

The superconducting gap structure of LaFePO (T_(c)=7.4 K) is studied by
thermal conductivity (κ) at low temperatures in fields H parallel and
perpendicular to the c axis. A clear two-step field dependence of κ(H)
with a characteristic field H_(s)( ∼ 350 Oe) much lower than the upper
critical field H_(c2) is observed. In spite of the large anisotropy of
H_(c2), κ(H) in both H directions is nearly identical below H_(s). Above
H_(s), κ(H) grows gradually with H with a convex curvature, followed by
a steep increase with strong upward curvature near H_(c2). These results
indicate multigap superconductivity with active two-dimensional (2D) and
passive three-dimensional bands having contrasting gap values. Together
with the recent penetration depth results, we suggest that the 2D bands
consist of nodal and nodeless ones, consistent with extended s-wave
symmetry.

Recent discovery of a new class of Fe-based superconductors[1] has
attracted much attention. Among them, FeAs-based compounds have aroused
great interest because of the high transition temperature T_(c). Undoped
arsenide LaFeAsO is nonsuperconducting and has a spin-density-wave (SDW)
ground state but becomes superconducting (T_(c)=25 K) when electron
doped.[2] By changing the rare-earth ion, T_(c) reaches as high as 55 K
in SmFeAs (O,F).[3] A key question is the origin of the pairing
interaction. Since the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter
is intimately related to the pairing interaction at the microscopic
level, its identification is of primary importance.

Fully gapped superconducting states in FeAs-based superconductors have
been reported by the penetration depth measurements of
PrFeAsO_(1 − y),[4] SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(y),[5] and
Ba_(1 − x),K_(y)Fe₂As_(2y),[6] angle-resolved photoemission,[7] thermal
conductivity,[8] and NMR (Ref. [9]) measurements of
Ba_(1 − x),K_(x)Fe₂As₂. Some of them give evidence of multiband
superconductivity with two distinct gaps. On the other hand, the NMR of
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (Ref. [10]) and PrFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) (Ref. [11])
and the penetration depth measurements of Ba(Fe_(1 − x),Co_(x))₂As₂
(Ref. [12]) suggest the presence of low-lying excitations, which could
be indicative of nodes. Theoretically, it is proposed that a good
nesting between hole and electron pockets prefers the "s_(z)" symmetry
where the gap is finite at all Fermi surfaces but changes its sign on
different bands.[13, 14, 15] Recent neutron resonant scattering[16] and
the impurity effects on the penetration depth[17, 6] are consistent with
this symmetry.

The phosphide LaFePO (Ref. [18]) has quite different magnetic and
superconducting properties from LaFeAsO, e.g., LaFePO is nonmagnetic in
the normal state,[19] while they are isomorphic and share a similar
electronic structure.[20, 21] Recently, a superconducting state of
LaFePO has been suggested to possess line nodes in the gap function by a
linear temperature dependence of the penetration depth at low
temperatures.[22, 23] However, on which Fermi surfaces the nodes locate
in the multiband electronic structure is not yet clarified, and while
several candidates have been theoretically proposed,[24, 25] the
superconducting symmetry in LaFePO remains elusive. Thus the
clarification of the detailed gap structure of LaFePO is expected to
provide important clues to the origins of magnetism and
superconductivity of Fe-based compounds.

Here, to shed further light on the gap symmetry of LaFePO, we present
the thermal conductivity measurements at low temperatures. The thermal
conductivity probes delocalized low-energy quasiparticle excitations and
is an extremely sensitive probe of the anisotropy of the gap amplitude.
We provide strong evidence of the multigap superconductivity in a more
dramatic fashion than FeAs-based superconductors, with two very
different gap values. We show that there are passive three-dimensional
(3D) bands and two kinds of active two-dimensional (2D) bands; one is
fully gapped and the nodes inferred from the penetration depth
measurements[22, 23] are most likely on the other 2D bands. This is
compatible with the extended s-wave (nodal s_(±)) symmetry for the gap
structure of LaFePO.

Single crystals with dimensions of ∼0.8×0.4 of ×0.05 mm³ were grown by a
Sn-flux method.[26] We carefully removed the Sn flux at the surface of
the crystals by rinsing in diluted hydrochloric acid. The resistivity
and susceptibility measurements show the sharp superconducting
transition at T_(c)=7.4 K (determined by the midpoint of the resistive
transition), which is slightly higher than the values reported by other
groups.[22, 27] The thermal conductivity κ was measured by a standard
four-wire steady method for a heat current q within the ab plane.

The temperature dependence of the in-plane resistivity ρ in the zero
field (inset of Fig. 1) depends on T as ρ=ρ₀ + AT², with ρ₀=4.9 μΩ cm
and A=3.3×10⁻³μΩ cm/K² below 50 K down to T_(c). The residual
resistivity ratio (RRR) is 28. Clear de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA)
oscillations were observed in samples from the same batch with nearly
the same RRR value.[26] The upper critical fields at T→0 K estimated by
the resistivity measurements are μ₀H_(c2)^(c)=1.0 T for H∥c axis and
μ₀H_(c2)^(ab)=8.6 T for H∥ab plane. This large anisotropy of the upper
critical field H_(c2) indicates that the bands active for the
superconductivity have a very anisotropic 2D electronic structure.

Figure 1 depicts the temperature dependence of κ/T in zero field and in
the normal state above H_(c2)^(ab). As the temperature is lowered, κ/T
decreases below T_(c). It can be clearly seen that the electron
contribution dominates well the phonon heat contribution because the
electronic contribution in κ at 1 K estimated by the Wiedemann-Franz
law, κ=L₀T/ρ (L₀=2.4×10⁻⁸Ω W/K is the Sommerfeld value), is 0.5 W/K² m
which is close to the observed value 0.65 W/K² m. Further, the phonon
contribution measured in a related compound BaFe₂As₂ (Ref. [28]) is one
order of magnitude smaller in low temperatures.

First we discuss the thermal conductivity in zero field. A residual term
κ₀₀/T at T→ 0 K in κ/T is clearly resolved. In the nodal
superconductors, such a residual term appears as a result of the
impurity scattering which induces quasiparticles even at T=0 K. In the
presence of line nodes in a single band superconductor, κ₀₀/T is roughly
estimated as ∼2(ξ_(ab)/ℓ) -(κ_(n)/T), where ξ_(ab) is the in-plane
coherence length, ℓ is the mean free path and κ_(n) is the thermal
conductivity in the normal state. Using ξ=94 nm from the dHvA
measurements [26] and ξ_(ab)=$\sqrt{\Phi_{0}/(2\pi H_{c2}^{c})}$=18 nm,
κ₀₀/T is estimated to be ∼0.19 W/K² m. This value is comparable to the
observed κ₀₀/T∼ 0.30 W/K² m, but we note that this estimate includes
large ambiguities due to the multiband effect which could alter
effective ξ_(ab) and κ_(n). So this comparison alone cannot be taken as
the evidence for line nodes in the superconducting gap. It should be
also noted that the residual term may arise from an extrinsic origin,
such as nonsuperconducting metallic region [27] with high thermal
conductivity although the sharp superconducting transition and the
observation of the dHvA oscillation indicate a good quality of the
crystal.

More vital information on the gap structure can be provided by the field
dependence of κ at low temperatures. The field-dependent part of κ(H) in
a mixed state mainly stems from the superconducting part of the crystals
even if a nonsuperconducting region was present in the crystal.
Moreover, the phonon scattering at the low temperatures is governed by
static defects and is therefore field independent. Further, it is well
known that fully gapped and nodal superconductors show a contrasting
field dependence [29], as illustrated in the lower inset of Fig. 2(a).
In fully gapped superconductors, quasiparticles excited by vortices are
localized and unable to transport heat until these vortices are
overlapped each other. Consequently, κ(H) shows a slow growth with H in
low fields and a rapid increase near H_(c2) (the dotted line), as
reported in Nb [30]. In sharp contrast, the heat transport in
superconductors with nodes or with a large anisotropy in the gap is
dominated by contributions from delocalized quasiparticles outside
vortex cores [31]. In the presence of line nodes where the density of
states has a linear energy dependence, κ(H) increases in proportion to
$\sqrt{H}$ (Ref. [32]) (the solid line). If nodeless and nodal gaps are
mixed in a multiband system without interband scatterings, an inflection
point emerges in

(squares). Lower inset: schematic field dependence of κ(H)−κ(0) in

the intermediate field regime (the dash-dotted line).[33]

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) depict κ(H) − κ(0) normalized by κ(H_(c2)) − κ(0)
for H ∥  c and H ∥  ab, respectively, measured at T  =  0.46 K
(0.062T_(c)) by sweeping H after zero-field cooling. We note that little
difference was observed between the data measured in zero-field and
field cooling conditions, indicating that the field trapping effect is
very small. For both field directions, the overall H dependence of κ is
quite similar. At very low fields, κ exhibits a pronounced increase with
increasing H. Remarkably, in spite of the large anisotropy of H_(c2),
κ(H) is nearly identical for both H directions at low fields and almost
saturates at around H_(s) ∼ 350 Oe, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b).
Above H_(s), κ(H) becomes anisotropic with respect to the field
direction and is governed by the anisotropy of H_(c2). For both H ∥  c
and H ∥  ab, κ(H) grows gradually with H with a convex curvature
followed by a rapid increase with a concave curvature up to H_(c2);
there is an inflection point at ∼  H_(c2)/4( − H_(c2)/8) for H ∥  c
(H ∥  ab).

The steep increase and subsequent gradual increase in κ(H) above H_(s)
for both H ∥  c and H ∥  ab indicate that a substantial portion of the
quasiparticles is already restored at H_(s), much below H_(c2). Such a
two-step field dependence has been reported in MgB₂,[34] PrOs₄Sb₁₂,[35]
and URu₂Si₂,[36] providing direct evidence for the multiband
superconductivity. Here H_(s) is interpreted as a "virtual upper
critical field" that controls the field dependence of the smaller gap of
the "passive" band. Its superconductivity is most likely induced by the
proximity effect of the "active" bands with primary gap. The ratio of
the large and small gaps is roughly estimated to be
$\Delta_{L}/\Delta_{S}\!\sim\!\sqrt{H_{c2}/H_{s}}\!\sim\!6$. If we take
Δ_(L) ∼ 1.7k_(B)T_(c) ∼ 13 K, we obtain Δ_(S) ∼ 2 K.

We note that the steep increase in κ(H) below H_(s) is not due to the
influence of the first vortex penetration field, which is expected to be
anisotropic and much smaller than H_(c1) ∼ 100 Oe if the demagnetization
is taken into account.[37] We can also rule out a possibility that the
steep increase is caused by the remanent Sn flux because κ(T),
magnetization, and microwave surface impedance measurements[38] show no
anomaly at T_(c) of Sn (=3.72 K). Moreover, the low-field steep increase
disappears at T ∼ 1.5 K well below T_(c) of Sn [the upper inset of Fig.
2(a)], which is rather in good agreement with the gap size estimation.

The observed multiband superconductivity is compatible with the band
structure of LaFePO. The band structure calculations show that Fermi
surface consists of two electronic cylinders centered at the M point and
two hole cylinders centered at the Γ point, together with a single hole
pocket with 3D-like dispersion at the Z point in the Brillouin zone (see
the sketch in Fig. 3).[20; 21; 39] The 3D band is suggested to appear in
LaFePO, not in LaFeAsO, and has a character of the 3d_(3z² − i²) orbital
which is expected to have a weak coupling to other 2D bands.[21] Note
that only the 2D cylindrical electron and hole bands have been reported
by photoemission[40] and dHvA measurements.[26; 39] small gap are
negligible because the former is already saturates far below T_(c) and
the latter has a tiny density of states (less than 5

Finally we discuss the position of the nodes. As candidates of the gap
structure with line nodes, the "nodal s_(z)-wave" and "d-wave"
symmetries have been proposed for LaFePO.[25] We infer that the d-wave
can be excluded because it possesses line nodes in the 3D band (as well
as the 2D hole bands), which is unlikely for the reasons discussed
above. The nodal s_(z)-wave structure has a nodal gap on the 2D electron
band around M point and the 2D and 3D hole bands are fully gapped (see
the sketch in Fig. 3). The gap size of the 2D electron and hole bands
can be comparable to each other.[25] Therefore, we suggest that the
nodal s_(±)-wave structure can be the best candidate for the gap
symmetry of LaFePO.

In summary, from the measurements of the thermal conductivity, LaFePO is
found to be a multigap superconductor with 2D active and 3D passive
bands. The peculiar field dependence of κ provides a stringent
constraint on the superconducting gap structure in this system: there
exist fully gapped 2D and 3D bands and the nodes locate most likely on
the other 2D bands. These results are consistent with the nodal
s_(±)-wave symmetry proposed for the superconducting state of LaFePO.
