###### Abstract

We report on the electrical resistivity, thermoelectric power, and
electronic phase diagram of rhodium-doped NdFeAsO. Rhodium doping
suppresses the structural phase transition and spin-density wave
observed in the undoped material, and superconductivity emerges at x
close to 0.05, despite the distortion of FeAs₄ tetrahedra induced by the
large size difference between Rh and Fe elements. The $T_{\rm c}(x)$
curve is domelike, and the highest $T_{\rm c}$ is reached at x=0.1, with
$T_{\rm c}^{\rm meas}$=18 K. An upturn of the electrical resistivity
above $T_{\rm c}$ has been observed, with a Kondo-type behavior above
$T_{\rm c}$ and a Fermi-liquid behavior close to room temperature.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x)
("1111" compounds) in 2008,[1] an intense research activity has emerged
dealing with the study of the oxypnictides, a new family of
high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductors outside the cuprates family. In a
matter of months after the first report of Kamihara _et al._, the
critical temperature of these compounds has been raised to over 50 K by
replacing lanthanum by smaller rare-earth elements.[2] For a recent
review about the superconductivity in this materials family, see Ref.
[3].

The parent compound LaFeAsO, which consists in alternating La₂O₂ and
Fe₂As₂ layers, is not superconducting but it exhibits a metallic
behavior with a structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic as
well as a spin-density wave (SDW), both emerging around 150 K.[4] Upon
doping, the structural transition and the spin-density wave are both
destroyed and a superconducting state is observed.[4] This
superconducting state can be induced by electron doping, with fluorine
doping[1] or oxygen-vacancies formation[5] on the oxygen site, or with
thorium doping on the rare-earth site.[2] It can also emerge from a hole
doping with strontium on the rare-earth site.[6] More surprisingly, it
has been shown that in addition to the electron or hole doping in the
La₂O₂ layers, a partial substitution of iron by cobalt[7] or nickel[8]
in the Fe₂As₂ layers also leads to the emergence of superconductivity,
which is very different from the cuprates behavior where the
superconducting state is very sensitive to the presence of impurities on
the copper site. Indeed, the electronic phase diagram proposed by Wang
_et al._ for LaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)AsO exhibits a domelike curve for
$T_{\rm c}$ as a function of Co content,[9] which resembles that of
LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x).[1] However, it seems that hole doping cannot be
induced by substitutions in the Fe₂As₂ layers.[10, 11] Recently, Lee _et
al._ have reported the effect of Ru doping in optimally doped
NdFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11).[12] These authors showed that the rate of
$T_{\rm c}$ decrease induced by Ru doping is very small, despite the
structural distortion induced by the doping. Moreover, we have shown
that despite the large size difference between Fe and Rh elements,
superconductivity can be induced by rhodium doping in NdFeAsO.[13] In
this paper, we report on the transport properties and the electronic
phase diagram of NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO.

## II Experimental

Samples with nominal composition NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO (0.025<x<0.20)
were prepared by a solid-state reaction route, using Nd, As, Fe, and Rh
metals and Fe₂O₃ powder. All handlings were made in an Ar-filled glove
box with less than 1 ppm O₂ and H₂O. NdAs alloy was first obtained by
heating Nd and As under pure Ar in a closed silica tube at 900 ^(∘)C.
The single phase nature of the alloy was confirmed by x-ray diffraction
(XRD). NdAs was then carefully mixed in stoichiometric ratio with Fe,
Fe₂O₃, and Rh, and the resulting powder was pressed into 2 × 3 × 12 mm³
bars under 200 MPa. These bars were heated two times with intermediate
grinding and pressing, at 1150 ^(∘)C during 48 h under argon in closed
silica tubes. X-ray diffraction characterization was performed using a
Panalytical X’Pert diffractometer with a Ge(111) incident monochromator
and a X’celerator detector. The XRD patterns were analyzed using the
Rietveld method with the help of the fullprof software.[14] The
thermoelectric power was measured by a differential method with two
T-type thermocouples, by using the slope of the ΔV-ΔT curve with thermal
gradients along the samples up to about 0.3 K/mm, in a laboratory made
system. The electrical resistivity was obtained between 2 and 300 K and
between 0 and 9 T by a dc four wires method using a Quantum Design
physical properties measurement system (PPMS) and silver paste for the
electrical contacts. All transport measurements were performed in a
direction perpendicular to the pressing direction. Magnetic
susceptibility was measured down to 5 K using a Quantum Design magnetic
properties measurement system (MPMS) under 20 Oe.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO compounds
(x=0.025−0.2). All major Bragg peaks can be indexed using a tetragonal
unit cell with structure-type ZrCuSiAs,[15] represented in the inset of
Fig. 2, indicating that the samples are almost single phase. An example
of Rietveld refinement is shown in Fig. 2, which also shows the
positions of the Bragg reflexions of the 1111 phase. The typical R
values for all the refinements are $R_{\rm F}$∼ 3

The structural parameters determined using the Rietveld refinements are
summarized in Fig. 3 as a function of the rhodium fraction. A
significant increase in a is observed with increasing rhodium fraction,
which is consistent with the atomic radius of Rh being larger than that
of Fe.[16] This linear trend confirms that the substitution of iron by
rhodium in the NdFeAsO unit cell occurs. Despite the increase in the
lattice parameter a with increasing Rh fraction, the unit-cell volume is
almost unaffected by the substitution, due to the simultaneous decrease
in c that results in a reduced interlayer distance. Schematically, the
NdFeAsO unit cell can be pictured as alternating [Nd₂O₂]²⁺ and
[Fe₂As₂]²⁻ layers (see Fig. 2). The substitution of iron by rhodium
leads to an increase in the electrons density in the metal-pnictide
layer following [Fe² ⁻ ²Rh_(x)As₂]^((2 + x, 2)−), which increases the
interlayer Coulomb attraction and decreases the interlayer distance and
therefore the lattice parameter c. A similar behavior has already been
reported in Co-doped LaFeAsO, where the substitution of iron by cobalt
leads to a strong decrease in the c parameter whereas a remains almost
unchanged.[7, 9] This increase in the carriers concentration with Rh
doping is confirmed by our thermoelectric power measurements, see later.
Due to the simultaneous decrease in c and increase in a, the distortion
of the FeAs₄ tetrahedra increases. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the
difference between the two characteristic As-FeAs angles of the FeAs₄
tetrahedra increases gradually with the rhodium substitution. On the
contrary, fluorine doping leads to a decrease in the distortion of the
tetrahedral as compared to NdFeAsO.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity
in the series NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO normalized to the room-temperature
values. The undoped parent compound is known to exhibit a strong anomaly
of the electrical resistivity around 150 K followed by a large decrease
in the resistivity at lower temperature (see, for example, Ref. [17]).

is the undoped compound, where it has been attributed to a SDW and a
structural transition from tetragonal at room temperature to
orthorhombic at low temperature. With a further increase in the rhodium
fraction (_x_ > 0.05), no anomaly can be observed any longer, and an
unambiguous superconducting transition emerges at low temperature. The
inset of Fig. 4 shows the volumic magnetic susceptibility of
NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO, which exhibits the highest $T_{\rm c}$ in the
series, obtained in a zero-field-cooled mode with an excitation field of
20 Oe, assuming a sample density equal to the theoretical one. A
superconducting transition can be observed around 15 K. From the
diamagnetic signal at 5 K, the shielding fraction can be estimated to
about 20

The highest critical temperature observed in the NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO
series, $T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}$∼ 18 K, is much lower than the one
observed in NdFeAsO_(0.88)F_(0.12).[18] A similar difference has already
been reported between fluorine-doped and cobalt-doped LnFeAsO.[1, 9] Lee
_et al._ have suggested that the highest $T_{\rm c}$ is obtained when
the Fe₂As₂ lattice forms regular tetrahedra.[19] Our results are
consistent with this picture, with FeAs₄ tetrahedra being more distorted
and $T_{\rm c}$ being lower with Rh doping than with F doping. However,
the maximum critical temperature observed in NdFe_(0.96)Rh_(0.1)AsO is
much lower that the one that would be expected using the $T_{\rm c}$ vs
α₂ dependence suggested in Ref. [19], which should be closer to 30 K.

Two significant differences between the temperature dependence of the
electrical resistivity of the fluorine-doped sample[18] and of the
rhodium-doped ones (Fig. 4) can be underlined.

First, although both fluorine-doped and rhodium-doped samples exhibit a
metallic electrical resistivity close to room temperature, the
temperature dependence of the resistivity is different.
NdFeAsO_(0.88)F_(0.12) behaves like a "strange metal" with the exponent
x of ρ∼$T^{\rm x}$ that changes from x > 1 to x < 1 when the temperature
exceeds about 150 K.[20, 21] On the other hand, rhodium-doped samples
exhibit a Fermi-liquid behavior with ρ∼ρ₀+_AT_², which evidences
enhanced electron-electron interactions. Figure 5 shows the temperature
dependence of the normalized electrical resistivity in the series
NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO, with the temperature scale in T². A linear trend
can be observed for every sample above 200-220 K (0.05<_x_ < 0.2). These
observations, which are in good agreement with the results reported in
the series LaFe_(1 − x)Ni_(x)AsO,[22] are not fully consistent with the
electronic phase diagram suggested by Hess _et al.[23]_ for FeAs
superconductors, who indicated that the Fermi-liquid behavior should be
a characteristic feature of the overdoped regime.

Second, for the fluorine-doped sample, the resistivity in the normal
state is typical of a metal from $T_{\rm c}$ to room temperature. On the
contrary, in the rhodium-doped compounds, whereas the resistivity is
also metallic around room temperature, a minimum can be observed at
$T_{\rm min}$ followed by an upturn of the resistivity that exhibits a
semiconductorlike behavior between $T_{\rm min}$ and $T_{\rm c}$
(0.05<_x_ < 0.2). The temperature of the minimum of the resistivity
$T_{\rm min}$ shifts to lower temperatures when the rhodium fraction is
increased. Moreover, the maximum of resistivity above $T_{\rm c}$
becomes less pronounced for higher Rh fractions. A similar behavior has
already been reported in Ni-doped[8] and Co-doped LnFeAsO.[7, 9] A much
less pronounced upturn of the resistivity has also been reported in some
F-doped LaFeAsO samples with small fluorine content[1] whereas it does
not seem to be present in optimally doped samples or other rare earth
than lanthanum (Refs. [18] and [22, 23, 24]). At the first glance, it
seems that this metallic to semiconductorlike transition could be simply
explained by the local structural disorder induced in the conducting
Fe₂As₂ layer by rhodium doping. With increasing rhodium fraction, the
increased carriers’ concentration would lead to a more metallic behavior
that would eventually hide the upturn. However, this simple picture is
not consistent with the results recently published by Lee _et al.[12]_
These authors reported the effects of ruthenium doping on the electrical
transport behavior of fluorine-doped NdFeAsO_(0.89)F_(0.11). Whatever
the Ru fraction, no maximum of the resistivity has been observed and all
NdFe_(1 − x)Ru_(x)AsO_(0.89)F_(0.11) samples are metallic above
$T_{\rm c}$, which seems to rule out the possible role of the structural
disorder. Moreover, this upturn cannot be linked to thermal excitation
of carriers through a band gap, as band-structure calculations and
photoemission spectroscopy experiments have unambiguously proved the
metallic nature of this family of compounds (see, for example, Ref.
[24]).

Recently, Cao _et al._ have suggested that the resistivity upturn above
$T_{\rm c}$ could originate from Kondo effect.[22, 25] In their picture,
Ni doping in the Fe₂As₂ layer of LaFeAsO not only induces itinerant
carriers but also stabilized localized moment, in agreement with
band-structure calculations.[26] Indeed, the coexistence of itinerant
charge carriers and local moments and a resistivity upturn following a
log (T) behavior is often characteristic of Kondo effect.[27] A similar
log (T) dependence of the normal-state resistivity as also be observed
by Tropeano _et al._ in Fe_(1 + x)Te_(1 − x)Se_(x),[28] coupled to a B²
dependence of the magnetoresistivity. Moreover, the temperature
dependence of the reported magnetoresistivity is well described using a
Kondo formalism. In this latter case, the magnetic impurities originate
from the excess of Fe, which provides localized magnetic moments.[29,
30]

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of the normalized electrical
resistivity in the NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO series,

with the temperature scale in log(T). Although no linear trend can be
observed with x = 0.05 in any temperature range, all samples with x >
0.075 exhibit a linear behavior in a narrow temperature range (black
dashed lines). The absence of linear behavior with x = 0.05 could be
connected to a reminiscence of the spin-density wave, as this compound
lies close to the boundary of the superconducting area of the phase
diagram. The width of this log(T) area decreases with increasing Rh
fraction, from about 65 K with x = 0.075 to about 25 K with x = 0.2.
This decrease is connected to the electron doping induced by the
substitution of Fe by Rh. Indeed, band-structure calculations have shown
that the density of states at the Fermi level $N(E_{\rm F})$ is reduced
upon doping in the LnFeAsO system.[26] As the Kondo temperature
decreases when $N(E_{\rm F})$ decreases, increasing Rh fraction leads to
a decrease in $T_{\rm min}$. The upturn of the electrical resistivity
above $T_{\rm c}$ is more pronounced in Rh-doped samples than in the
F-doped ones (where it is not always present) because the substitution
of iron by rhodium increases not only the carrier concentration but
could also induce the presence of local moments in the Fe₂As₂ layer,
similarly to Ni doping in LaFeAsO or Fe excess in FeTe_(1 − x)Se_(x),
which in turn increases the electrons scattering rate. This observation
is also consistent with the highest observed $T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}$
being lower than the one expected considering the distortion of the
FeAs₄ tetrahedra, as the local moments induced by Rh doping could also
act as pair breaker and lower the critical temperature. Nevertheless,
the resistivity upturn above $T_{\rm c}$ could also originate from
weak-localization effects linked to the two-dimensional character of
this material, and no definitive conclusion can be drawn at the moment.

An electronic phase diagram of the series NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO based on
the electrical resistivity data is plotted in Fig. 7. The SDW area is
very narrow. The frontier is not well defined and from our data, it is
not clear if there is coexistence of the SDW and of superconductivity in
NdFe_(0.95)Rh_(0.05)AsO. For Rh fractions higher than 0.05, the SDW is
clearly suppressed, and a superconducting state emerges at low
temperature, with a domelike $T_{\rm c}$(Rh) curve, characteristic of
the FeAs superconductors. Although the details are different, this
domelike evolution is similar to the one reported for Co-doped
LnFeAsO.[7, 9] However, contrary to the Co-doped systems,
superconductivity is not destroyed up to x > 0.2. For x > 0.075, the
normal-state resistivity exhibits a Fermi-liquid behavior close to room
temperature, that changes to a "Kondo-type" temperature dependence above
$T_{\rm c}$, with $T_{\rm min}$ that decreases with increasing rhodium
fraction.

We have compared the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity under several magnetic fields up to 9 T for
NdFe_(0.9)Rh_(0.1)AsO, which exhibits the highest-$T_{\rm c}$ value in
the NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO series, in order to estimate the upper
critical field $H_{\rm c2}$. All curves are plotted in Fig. 8.
$T_{\rm c}^{0}$ corresponds to the zero resistivity temperature, defined
as the temperature where the resistivity goes below the sensibility
limit of the PPMS. As can be seen in Fig. 8, $T_{\rm c}^{40}$ decreases
very weakly with the magnetic field whereas $T_{\rm c}^{6}$ decreases
more rapidly leading to a widening of the superconducting transition,
characteristic of type II superconductivity (the field dependence of
$T_{\rm c}^{0}$ and $T_{\rm c}^{90}$ are plotted in the inset of Fig.
8). It is noteworthy that $T_{\rm c}^{0}$ is still higher than 4 K even
under a magnetic field as high as 9 T, which evidences the very robust
character of the superconducting state in this family of materials.
Without magnetic field, the width of the superconducting transition is
small. If we define $\Delta T_{\rm c}$ as
$T_{\rm c}^{90}$-$T_{\rm c}^{10}$, $\Delta T_{\rm c}$

is a low as 1.8 K, which is much smaller than the value reported for
cobalt doped LaFeAsO (Ref. [7]) or that the one of fluorine-doped
NdFeAsO.[31]

The slope (dH_(c2)/dT)_(|πT_(c)) for T_(c)⁰⁰ is about −9 T K⁻¹. Using
the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula
H_(c2)(0) =  − 0.693T_(c)(dH_(c2)/dT)_(|πT_(c)) leads to H_(c2) (0) on
the order of 100 T, which is much higher than the values reported for
Co-doped LnFeAsO,[7, 32] and of the same order as the value of
NdFeAsO_(0.83)F_(0.12).[31]

In the superconducting 1111 compounds, a peak of the thermoelectric
power above T_(c) has been widely reported (see, for example, Ref. [33]
and [34]). Wang _et al._ have suggested that this enhancement of the
thermoelectric power in superconducting compounds could be somehow
correlated with the onset of superconductivity.[9] Figure 9 shows
temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power in the series
NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO. All samples are n type, which is consistent with
an increase in the electrons concentration induced by the substitution
of Fe by Rh. Band-structure calculations have shown that 1111 compounds
are multiband materials, and that several electron and hole pockets
contribute to the electrical transport.[35] In a multiband system, the
thermoelectric power is a mixture of the individual thermoelectric power
of each contributing band following

$$S_{\text{\emph{tot}}}\!=\!\frac{\Sigma\sigma_{\text{\emph{c}}}S_{i}}{\Sigma \sigma_{i}}$$

with σ_(i) and S_(i) being, respectively, the conductivity of the ith
band and its contribution to the thermoelectric power (negative for an
electron band and positive for a hole band). The thermoelectric power of
undoped NdFeAsO has been reported by McGuire _et al.[17]_ Below about
150 K, the thermoelectric power is dominated by hole pockets and is
positive. Then a sharp transition occurs at about 150 K, with denotes a
strong evolution of the conduction mechanism with the structural
transition and the emergence of the spin-density wave. Above 150 K, the
thermoelectric power is negative up to room temperature. When iron is
substituted by rhodium, the hole pockets are gradually suppressed, and
the thermoelectric power becomes n type in the whole temperature range.
Although the sign of the thermoelectric power does not change, a
reminiscence of the transition between electron-dominated and
hole-dominated thermoelectric power can still be observed for x=0.025.
When the rhodium fraction is increased further, no feature (transition,
bump, or kink) can be observed and the temperature dependence of the
thermoelectric power gradually approaches that of a metal. This
evolution can also be explained by considering a gradual suppression of
the hole pockets and therefore a decrease in the "positive"
contributions to the total thermoelectric power.

If we compare the thermoelectric power of F-doped samples[33] and that
of Rh-doped samples, it is noteworthy that no significant peak can be
observed above T_(c) in superconducting NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO samples
(see, for instance, x=0.1 and x=0.125, which correspond to the highest
observed T_(c)). This behavior is also slightly different from the one
observed for Co-doped LnFeAsO.[7, 9] Therefore, it seems that the
electronic band structure is influenced by Rh doping as compared to F or
Co doping.

In order to compare the behavior of T_(c) and S of Rh-doped samples to
the ones of Co-doped samples as reported by Wang _et al._,[9] the
evolution with the rhodium fraction of T_(c)⁰⁰, the room-temperature
thermoelectric power and the room-temperature resistivity have been
plotted in Fig. 10. No obvious link can be seen between the critical
temperature and the thermoelectric power, and no anomalous enhancement
of the thermoelectric power in the superconducting window can be seen.
Therefore, this enhancement does not seem to be an universal feature of
iron-based arsenic superconductors. However, the evolutions of the
room-temperature values of the resistivity and of the thermoelectric
power can both be well explained taking into account an increase in the
electrons concentration in the system due to rhodium doping. This raises
into question the origin of the abnormal contribution to the
thermoelectric power in F-doped iron pnictides.

## IV Conclusion

To sum up, our systematic study of the electrical transport properties
in the series NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO have lead to estab

lish the electronic phase diagram of Rh-doped NdFeAsO. The evolution
with rhodium doping of the thermoelectric power as well as the
room-temperature value of the electrical resistivity indicates that
rhodium doping on the iron site first leads to a suppression of the hole
pockets at the Fermi level and then to an increase in the electrons
concentration. The spin-density wave and the structural transition are
suppressed by Rh doping and a superconducting state emerges for a
rhodium fraction close to 0.05. Rh-doped NdFeAsO compounds exhibit a
domelike dependence of $T_{\rm c}$, similar to F-doped compounds,
although the highest value of $T_{\rm c}$ is much lower with Rh doping.
This difference can be well explained taking into account both the
distortion of the FeAs₄ tetrahedra and the pair-breaking effect of
localized moments in the Fe₂As₂ layer induced by Rh doping. These
localized moments also possibly induce a scattering of the electrons
above $T_{\rm c}$ leading to a Kondo-type behavior of the electrical
resistivity, which is not observed in F-doped NdFeAsO, although no
definitive conclusion about the resistivity upturn can be provided at
the moment. Close to room temperature, NdFe_(1 − x)Rh_(x)AsO compounds
exhibit a Fermi-liquid behavior, which denotes strong electron-electron
interactions.
