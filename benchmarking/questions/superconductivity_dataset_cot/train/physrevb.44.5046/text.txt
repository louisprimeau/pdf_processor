###### Abstract

We report results of elastic- and inelastic-neutron-scattering studies of three single crystals of the layered perovskite La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4+\delta}\), with \(\delta\!=\!0.00\), 0.067, and 0.077, as well as neutron powder diffraction on a material with an oxygen excess \(\delta\!=\!0.065\). The magnetic correlations are highly sensitive to the oxygen content, and three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order sets in at \(T_{N}\!\geq\!300\) K, and \(T_{N}\!=\!68\), and 48 K for the single crystals, respectively, and at \(T_{N}\!=\!74\) K for the powder sample. The crystal with \(\delta\!=\!0.067\) was studied in detail to characterize the tetragonal to orthorhombic (\(T_{s}\!=\!232\)-\(240\) K) and antiferromagnetic (\(T_{N}\!=\!68\) K) transitions. The order parameter \(\eta(T)\) for the orthorhombic distortion shows a power-law dependence on temperature with the exponent \(\beta\!=\!0.21\) and hysteresis, suggesting that this transition is less than second order. Two-dimensional critical scattering is observed around the antiferromagnetic phase transition. The magnetic excitation spectra in the three-dimensional ordered state are characterized by small anisotropy gaps between \(\sim\!0\) and 3 meV, and large effective in-plane spin-wave velocities, which decrease with increasing \(\delta\). For \(\delta\!=\!0.077\), \(c\!=\!130\) meV \(\AA\); and for \(\delta\!=\!0.00\), \(c\!\geq\!300\) meV \(\AA\).

## 1 Introduction

The layered perovskite La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4}\) is isostructural with the parent high-\(T_{c}\) superconductor, La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), and has been extensively studied because of its unusual transport and magnetic properties. Early investigations showed clear inconsistencies due to lack of control of oxygen stoichiometry, on which structure and properties are sensitively dependent. Since Ni\({}^{2+}\) (\(3d^{8}\)) has spin \(S\!=\!1\) in contrast with Cu\({}^{2+}\) (\(3d^{9}\)) with spin \(S\!=\!\frac{1}{2}\) for La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), a study of magnetic correlations in La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4+\delta}\) as a function of oxygen nonstoichiometry may provide useful insight into possible magnetic aspects of the mechanism for high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity in the analogous cuprates.

Early reports\({}^{1-5}\) consistently concluded that the La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4}\) structure was of the undistorted body-centered tetragonal K\({}_{2}\)NiF\({}_{4}\) type with \(I4/mmm\) (No. 139) (Ref. 6) symmetry, but a comparison of lattice constants revealed discrepancies which we now attribute to variations in oxygen stoichiometry. Subsequent electron-diffraction studies revealed superstructure reflections consistent with a distortion associated with octahedral rotation.\({}^{7}\) From a combination of electron diffraction and x-ray powder diffraction, a \(\sqrt{2}\)a \(\times\)\(\sqrt{2}\)b \(\times\)c supercell with orthorhombic \(Bmab\) (No. 64) symmetry was identified for nearly stoichiometric material at room temperature.\({}^{8,9}\) Odier _et al.\({}^{10}\)_ investigated the temperature dependence of cell constants of several powder specimens quenched from 1000\({}^{\circ}\)C in atmospheres ranging from pure argon to air. They found tetragonal \(I4/mmm\) symmetry for more oxidized compositions and orthorhombic symmetry for samples quenched under argon. Variations in stoichiometry in the La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4+\delta}\) system have been shown to arise from incorporation of interstitial oxygen defects in samples where the [La]/[Ni] ratio was found to be 2.00\(\pm\)0.01, using standard wet chemical methods.\({}^{11}\)

Odier _et al.\({}^{12}\)_ reported the symmetry of the stoichiometric composition as orthorhombic \(Pncb\) (No. 50) for stoichiometric La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4}\) based on powder x-ray and neutron data; however, the neutron Rietveld refinement of La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4,00}\) by Jorgenson _et al.\({}^{13}\)_ as well as recent results from four-circle x-ray diffraction on a transparent single-domain crystal of stoichiometric La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4}\) (Ref. 14) are consistent with \(Bmab\) symmetry at room temperature. X-ray single-crystal refinement\({}^{14}\) of the orthorhombic \(Bmab\) phase gave an octahedral polar canting angle of 5.4\({}^{\circ}\) with \(r_{\rm Ni\!\cdot\!0}\!=\!1.948\) A in the basal plane and 2.244 A axially (Fig. 1). Lattice parameters were found to be \(a\!=\!5.473\) A, \(b\!=\!5.532\) A, and \(c\!=\!12.541\) A. Jorgenson _et al.\({}^{13}\)_ also found that the or thorhombic _Bmnab_ phase exists for La2NiO4+d in the range 0 < 8 < 0.02, whereas an oxygen-rich phase exists for 0.13 < 8 < 0.18 with _Fmmm_ symmetry rather than _I4/mmm_. For intermediate stoichiometries, the two phases were found to coexist, suggesting that phase separation has occured similar to that observed in the La2CuO4+d system [15]. The oxygen defect was located at the (1, 4', 1, 4') site by neutron Rietveld refinement of the _Fmmm_ phase. [13]

Tavares [16] reported differential scanning calorimetric results showing a broad anomaly in the temperature range 570-680 K, which is attributed to a second-order structural transition. On heating, electron diffraction [8] shows a gradual loss of superlattice reflections in stoichiometric La2NiO4 in the range 550-700 K, consistent with a continuous orthorhombic to tetragonal (_I4/mmm_) transition. Rodriguez-Carvajal _et al._[17] report a second phase transition near 80 K in stoichiometric La2NiO4 with no obvious change of space group, but with basal plane lattice parameters of the low-temperature phase which are equivalent. Lander _et al._[18] have recently found that this is a first-order transition occurring at 70.0 +- 0.5 K for d = 0.001-0.002 and have assigned the symmetry of the low-temperature phase as _P4/ncm_.

The phonon dispersion curves of La2NiO4 have been measured by Pintschovius _et al._[19] using inelastic neutron scattering. They found pronounced anomalies in the phonon branches involving in-plane nickel-oxygen stretching vibrations. Boni _et al._[20] did not feel that they could observe similar anomalies in recent neutron experiments on La2CuO4.

Early transport measurements on nonstoichiometric, polycrystalline La2NiO4 showed semiconducting behavior at low temperature and a gradual change to metallic behavior above 500 K. [21, 22] Single-crystal transport measurements [7, 9] on La2NiO4+d with 0.02 < 8 < 0.05 show that this transition is restricted to the basal planes, with no anomaly evident with current directed along the unique, higher resistivity axis. The anisotropy approaches 2 orders of magnitude at low temperature. Odier _et al._[23] report more insulating behavior in a stoichiometric sample. The temperature dependence has been described as Arrhenius-like [7, 9] with activation energies in the range 50-80 meV, or in terms of Mott variable-range hopping. [23]

The magnetic susceptibility, _kh_(_T_), is also strongly dependent on d. Highly stoichiometric La2NiO4 shows nearly temperature-independent behavior in the range 80 K-475 K. [8, 24] Higher-temperature Faraday measurements by Schartman and Honig [25] indicate that \(T_{N}\) = 650 K near the stoichiometric limit. Susceptibility measurements on powders prepared by high-temperature syntheses in air typically show a small cusp or break in _kh_(_T_) near 200 K. [26, 27] A pronounced cusp in _kh_(_T_) is observed in single crystals near 200 K with d = 0.02 for **H**\(\parallel\)**c**, yet unobserved with **H**\(\parallel\)**c**; a smaller anomaly is observed at lower temperatures for larger d. [8, 24] These anomalies have been interpreted in terms of the onset of three-dimensional (3D) antiferromagnetic order with spins slightly canted out of the basal plane, producing a net moment along **c** in the presence of an applied field, [8, 9, 24] much as has been subsequently proposed for La2CuO4+d. [28, 29]

Spin-wave dispersions in the antiferromagnetically ordered phase of La2CuO4+d are very difficult (but not impossible) to probe because of the extremely high-spin-wave velocities found in these materials, \(c\) = 0.85 eV A, [30] In La2NiO4+d, however, much lower spin-wave velocities (0.1-0.2 eV A) have been observed [31] and are strongly dependent on d. In a recent letter, [31] two of us reported elastic- and inelastic-neutron-scattering experiments on two single crystals of La2NiO4+d.

In the present paper we describe a detailed neutron-scattering study of the magnetic correlations in three single crystals and one polycrystalline sample of La2NiO4+d with d = 0.00, 0.067, 0.077, and ~0.065, respectively. The experimental procedure is described in Sec. II. In Sec. III, we discuss the overall structural properties based on neutron powder and single-crystal diffraction of the respective phases, and we look in detail at the orthorhombic-tetragonal transition of one of the single crystals. Section IV concentrates on the magnetic phase transition and its oxygen-defect dependence, and Sec. V is concerned with the spin-wave dynamics as a function of oxygen content. Finally, in Sec. VI, we summarize the results and compare with results known for La2CuO4.

## II Experimental Methods

### Sample preparation and characterization

The La2NiO4+d single crystals investigated were grown by radio-frequency skull melting, as described in Ref. 32. For the present study, three single crystals denoted LN1, LN2, and LN3 were used, where LN signifies lanthanum nickel (oxide). Crystal LN1, with an approximate volume of 1.0 cm3, was annealed at 1470 K in a CO/CO2 buffer to achieve an oxygen fugacity, \(\log_{10}\)/O2 = -8.70, as monitored by a Y-ZrO2 solid electrolyte cell calibrated against the NiO/Ni buffer. The La2NiO4/Ni reduction boundary at 1470 K occurs at approximately \(\log_{10}\)/O2 = -9.0. Since the range of substoichiometric compositions is expected to be very small, requiring Ni+ for charge compensation, the most stoichiometric (d=0) composition for La2NiO4 is expected very near the reduction boundary. Crystals LN2 and LN3 are as-grown crystals with volumes of approximately 0.5 cm3 selected from different regions of the 1.4 kg boule in which they were grown.

The amount of interstitial oxygen was determined for crystals LN2 and LN3 by multiple iodometric titrations carried out in a glove box under nitrogen with deaerated solutions, yielding d=0.067 and 0.077+-0.002, respectively. The value of d for the powder specimen was not directly determined; however, based on comparison of lattice parameters \(T_{N}\) and \(T_{s}\) between powder and single-crystal specimens determined as described below, we infer that d  0.065. Room-temperature x-ray powder diffraction patterns were acquired with a Philips APD 3520 diffractometer equipped with a Johansson graphite monochromator on the detector arm, using Cu _Ka_ radiation. Fragments from crystals LN2 and LN3 were ground with Si internal standards to determine room-temperature lattice constants.

### Neutron scattering

Neutron powder diffraction was carried out on a 10-g sample, which was obtained by grinding as-grown crystals of irregular shape which were not well suited for other use. To minimize variations in d, these crystals were selected from a localized region near the center of the boule. The sample was sealed in helium and mounted in a closed-cycle refrigerator on the H4S spectrometer at Brookhaven's High Flux Beam Reactor. A neutron wavelength of 2.37 A was used along with a set of pyrolytic graphite filters capable of discriminating to better than 1 part in 104 against the l/2 component of the beam.

The single-crystal experiments were conducted on several triple-axis spectrometers at Brookhaven's High Flux Beam Reactor. For the unpolarized experiments, pyrolytic graphite crystals were used as monochromator and analyzer with fixed final energies \(3.5\leq E_{f}\leq 50\) meV, and different combinations of 10' to 80' collimators depending on the conflicting requirements of intensity and resolution. The higher-order neutrons were always attenuated by pyrolytic graphite or cooled Be filters. The polarized neutron experiments discussed in Secs. IV and VI were performed on a modified triple-axis spectrometer using vertically magnetized Heusler Cu2MnAl(111) transmission crystals as monochromator and analyzer. For the measurements below room temperature, the samples were mounted in (_h01_) and (_hk_0) zones (using _Bmab_ notation) on the cold finger of a closed-cycle displex refrigerator.

## III Structure

There are several possible subgroups of the idealized K2NiF4 structure--_I_4/_mmm_ (No. 139) which may arise as a consequence of displacive phase transitions generating \(\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}\times 1\) supercells.[6] These supercells are expected to belong to the subgroups _Bmab_ (No. 64), \(P\)42/_ncm_ (No. 138), or _Pccn_ (No. 56). _Fmmm_ symmetry may also be observed if there is significant disorder in the NiO6 octahedral distortions. In the case of _Bmab_, the stoichiometric La2NiO4 space group at room temperature, octahedral rotation occurs about the a axis, whereas in \(P\)42/_ncm_ rotation about (110) is observed. In the case of _Pccn_, the rotation would occur about an axis intermediate between (100) and (110). For reference, the room-temperature symmetry of stoichiometric La2CuO4 is _Bmab_ while oxygen excess La2CuO4+d has been described as possessing _Bmab_ (Ref. 33) or _Fmmm_ (Ref. 15) symmetry.

### Powder diffraction

Room-temperature x-ray powder diffraction patterns from powdered fragments from crystals LN2 and LN3 are consistent with single-phase \(I\)4/_mmm_ symmetry. Lattice parameters for LN2 are \(a\) = 3.8689(2) A and \(c\) = 12.6248(10) A based on high-angle reflections. For LN3, \(a\) = 3.8685(2) A and \(c\) = 12.6353(6) A.

The neutron powder diffraction pattern for La2NiO4+d(d  0.065) at room temperature is also consistent with a single-phase tetragonal \(I\)4/_mmm_ structure with \(a\) = 3.871(4) A and \(c\) = 12.630(5) A. Although no evidence of other phases was observed, the \(R\) factor of a preliminary powder refinement is limited to about 12%, probably due to disorder associated with either a correlated distribution of interstitial oxygen or octahedral tilting. As the sample was cooled, significant broadening of the (110) tetragonal peak was observed in the range 220-250 K, indicative of a transition to an orthorhombic phase. At 9 K the powder diffraction pattern corresponds to orthorhombic _Bmab_ with \(a\) = 5.452(2) A, \(b\) = 5.490(2) A, and \(c\) = 12.617(2) A. The splitting of the (400), (040) reflections at 9 K is shown in Fig. 2, corresponding to a splitting parameter (_b_ - \(a\) / \(a\) )0 = 0.007.

### Single-crystal diffraction

Crystal LN2 with d = 0.067 was studied in detail by neutron diffraction in the temperature region around the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition. This was done on the cold source spectrometer (H9) with an incident neutron energy of 3.5 meV and very tight collimation in or der to resolve the splitting of the (200), (020) reflections of the \(Bmab\) cell as close to the transition as possible. These reflections are observed as a sum of (200) and (020) due to twinning of the crystal. The temperature dependence of the reflections was examined both on heating and cooling to check for hysteresis. A sum of two Gaussians was fitted to each scan, from which **a** and **b** were obtained. The temperature dependencies of **a** and **b** are plotted for heating and cooling in Fig. 3(a). The splitting parameter is plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 3(b). It is clear that the transition is hysteretic with \(T_{S}^{\prime}\)= 232.2 K and \(T_{S}^{\prime}\)= 240.5 K. The solid curve in Fig. 3(b) represents a power-law fit to the data for decreasing temperature, from which the exponent obtained is \(\eta\)= 0.21. The relatively small exponent and hysteresis suggest that the transition is less than second order. Crystal LN3 with \(\delta\)= 0.077 exhibited broadening of reflections at low temperatures, as expected due to orthorhombic distortion; however, the splitting parameter was too small to clearly resolve the structural transition with the available resolution.

## IV Magnetic ordering

All of the La2NiO4+8 samples investigated exhibit 3D antiferromagnetic (AFM) order below some temperature \(T_{N}\)\(<\)\(T_{S}\), where \(T_{S}\) is the onset temperature for the tetragonal-orthorhombic transition. \(T_{N}\) depends strongly on the oxygen nonstoichiometry, \(\delta\), as is also observed in La2CuO4.[34]

### Powder diffraction

Below 75 K, the powder sample exhibits reflections in addition to the \(Bmab\)-allowed reflections (\(h,k,l\)). Because their intensities decay with increased scattering angle, they originate from magnetic order. Figure 4 shows a 2\(\theta\) scan near the (011) and (101) peak positions (indicated by arrows) at 9 and 103 K demonstrating loss of 3D AFM order at the higher temperature. The resolution

  was sufficient to show that the superlattice peak is at the (011) and not the (101) position, which means that the antiferromagnetic order propagates along [100], not [010]. The systematic absence of reflections such as (100) implies that the magnetic moments are parallel to [100]. Thus, the magnetic structure consists of AFM-ordered basal planes which are stacked so that nearest-neighbor Ni\({}^{2+}\) ions are oppositely polarized as illustrated in Fig. 6(a). This is distinguished from the magnetic structures found in K\({}_{2}\)NiF\({}_{4}\) (Ref. [35]) and La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (Ref. [36]) [Fig. 6(b)] where moments are ordered along [001] and [100], respectively. Table 1 summarizes the results for the ordered moments [in the structure of Fig. 6(a)] obtained from analyzing various powder reflections. The ordered moment at 9 K was determined to be 0.86\(\mu_{B}\) using the form-factor data of NiO.[37]

Figure 5 shows the normalized intensity temperature dependence of the magnetic peak (011), characteristic of a continuous transition. The fitted curve is of the form \(I\sim(1-T/T_{N})^{\beta}\), where \(T_{N}\) = 74 +- 2 K and \(\beta\) = 0.27 +- 0.05. The meaning of the parameter \(\beta\) is unclear, however, because of the obvious disorder in this nonstoichiometric sample.

### Single-crystal diffraction

Below \(T_{N}\), superlattice reflections were observed at (0\(k\)1) positions where both \(k\) and \(l\) are odd and at (_h_0_1) positions with \(h\) odd and \(l\) # 0 even. Polarized neutron diffraction confirmed these to be of magnetic origin and verified the direction of ordered moments as [100]. Not surprisingly, these reflections are consistent with those found in the powder and associated with the structure of Fig. 6(a). The peak intensity of the (011) reflection is presented as a function of temperature in Fig. 5(b) for crystals LN2 and LN3. These curves exhibit considerable rounding, most probably due to disorder in these \(\delta\) \(\neq\) 0 samples relative to what is seen in typical antiferromagnets. If we define them as the onset temperatures for visible AFM Bragg scattering, the Neel temperatures for these crystals are 68 and 48 K, respectively.

### Critical scattering from single crystal

La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4+8}\) also exhibits strong two-dimensional magnetic correlations between spins in the basal plane for \(T>T_{N}\),[31] similar to those observed in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\),[38] which are characterized by the presence of rods of inelastic scattering along the [10_1_] and [01_1_] directions. The correlations are dynamic in character, with no statically

  ordered moment; therefore, the rods are not easily seen for the elastic-scattering condition _#o_ = 0, but only when the cross section is integrated over energy.31,39 As the 3D ordering temperature, \(T_{N}\), is approached, two-dimensional quasielastic critical scattering begins to appear near _#o_ = 0. Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the nominal _#o_ = 0 peak intensity at a representative point along the rod, **Q** = (1,0,1.2) for crystal LN2. The quasielastic scattering exhibits a very pronounced peak near the Neel point, \(T_{N}\) = 68 K.

To further investigate the quasielastic scattering in crystal LN2, energy scans were obtained at four different temperatures near \(T_{N}\). Figure 8 shows scans obtained with the scattering vector held fixed at **Q** = (1,0,1.2) and the quasielastic incoherent background subtracted using equivalent scans obtained off the rod at **Q** = (1.15,0,1.2). Well above \(T_{N}\) at \(T\) = 84.2 K only a broad quasielastic peak is found which appears to be almost independent of temperature, at least between 84.2 and 74.5 K. The dashed line through the 84.2K data is a copy of the dashed line to guide the eye for the 74.5 K scan. **As we** approach \(T_{N}\), we see that a narrow elastic peak develops on top of the broad peak. The elastic peak is reminiscent of "central peaks" found near various structural phase transitions. Well below \(T_{N}\), at \(T\) = 30 K no elastic or quasielastic intensity is observed on the rod, as expected.

## V Magnetic Dynamics

To study the magnetic fluctuations in the ordered state of La2NiO4+, we have performed a variety of inelastic constant-**Q** and constant-_#o_ scans for the three single crystals. In Fig. 9, constant-_#o_ scans are shown for (a) LN1 (8=0), (b) LN2 (8=0.067), and (c) LN3

Figure 8: **Energy scans with fixed scattering vector \(Q\) = (1,0,1.2) for crystal LN2 at (a) \(T\) = 84.2 K, (b) \(T\) = 74.5 K, (c) \(T\) = 66.0, and (d) \(T\) = 30 K. The quasielastic incoherent background has been subtracted using equivalent scans at \(Q\) = (1.15,0,1.2).

Figure 7: Peak intensity at \(Q\) = (1,0,1.2) and nominal zero-energy transfer as a function of temperature for crystal LN2.

  (d = 0.077). The coordinate \(h\) represents the in-plane momentum transfer in reciprocal-lattice units; as we describe below, the inelastic data are independent of the momentum transfer perpendicular to the basal planes. The data in (a) were taken at room temperature where LN1 is still antiferromagnetically ordered, whereas the data in (b) and (c) are recorded at \(T\) = 10 K, also below the Neel temperatures of the samples in question. The constant energy transfer and spectrometer collimations are noted at or above each set of data. Most of the scans are performed with the final energy fixed at \(E_{f}\) = 13.7 meV except for the two upper scans in Fig. 7(b), which are taken at \(E_{f}\) = 50 meV [denoted by an asterisk (*) at the energy transfer]. The data are raw in the sense that no corrections for background have been made.

Conventional antiferromagnetic spin waves are characterized by a linear dispersion relation, \(\hat{\pi}_{00} = cq\), near the antiferromagnetic zone center. For sufficiently large \(c\), _#o/c_ will correspond to a reduced wave vector below the resolution limit of the spectrometer. To escape this limit, the best strategy is to increase \(\hat{\pi}\omega\). Before the spin waves become resolved in the sense implied by a double peak in a constant-_#o_ scan, as has indeed been done recently [30] for La2CuO4 at \(\hat{\pi}_{00} = 0.1\) eV, the constant \(\hat{\pi}_{00}\) scans consist of single peaks somewhat broader than the experimental resolution. Figures 9(a) and 9(b) illustrate this effect. Note that, in (b), the spectra become asymmetric for the largest \(\hat{\pi}_{00}\) because of the focusing effect derived from alignment of the resolution ellipse [in (\(\hat{\pi}_{00}\))-_q_ space] with the dispersion cone on only one side of the antiferromagnetic zone center (see also Fig. 10). To quantify the data and check the consistency of the spin-wave interpretation, a simple analytical expression for the spin-wave scattering was fitted to each scan,

\[S(q,\omega ) = A\left[ {\frac{\Gamma}{(\hat{\pi}\omega - cq)^{2} + \Gamma^{2}} + \frac{\Gamma}{(\hat{\pi}\omega + cq)^{2} + \Gamma^{2}}} \right] + {\bf B}{\bf G}\;,\]

where \(A\) is a scale factor, \(G\) is the inverse lifetime, \(c\) is the spin-wave velocity, \(q\) is the distance in **Q** space from the 2D zone center, and BG is the background. The cross section above was convolved with the spectrometer resolution function, and the parameters adjusted by a least-squares fitting routine to achieve maximum consistency with the data. Values obtained for \(G\) were all very small, indicating that the spin-wave scattering is resolution limited. The most interesting parameter, the spin-wave velocity, \(c\), was constant for each sample as long as \(\hat{\pi}_{00} > 3\) meV, a result which is obvious from the experimental dispersion curves plotted in Fig. 10 [the fitted magnon wave vectors are used to obtain _c_(_q_)] along with that measured for La2CuO4. The curves for the constant energy scans in Fig. 9 with \(\hat{\pi}_{00} > 3\) represent the free fits of the cross section in Eq. (1). Due to the limitations of the instrument resolution, the data from the stoichiometric sample LN1 provide only a lower bound for the spin-wave velocity for \(d\) = 0. The averaged results from the least-squares fits are \(\hat{\pi}\varepsilon \geq 300\) meV A for \(d\) = 0, \(\hat{\pi}c = 130 \pm 10\) meV A for \(d\) = 0.067, and \(\hat{\pi}\varepsilon = 98 \pm 7\) meV A

Figure 9: Constant-_#o_ scans for (a) LN1 (8 = 0), (b) LN2 (8 = 0.067) and (c) LN3 (8 = 0.077). The coordinate \(h\) represents in-plane momentum transfer in reciprocal-lattice units.

  for \(\delta\!=\!0.077\). For comparison, \(\hbar c\!=\!850\!\pm\!30\) meV A for nominally stoichiometric La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\).[30]

Figure 11 shows constant-\(\mathbf{Q}\) scans for the three La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4+\delta}\) crystals. At \(\mathbf{Q}\!=\!(1,0,0)\) and (3,0,0), the spectra have the same shape, but the intensity is lower for the larger of the two magnetically equivalent momentum transfers, see Fig. 11(a). It is therefore safe to conclude that the strong scattering at the ridge is of magnetic origin. As was noted in Ref. [31], the spectra are virtually independent of the component of the momentum transfer along [001], i.e., the fluctuations in the 3D ordered state are mainly of 2D character. The most pronounced features in the constant-\(\mathbf{Q}\) scans are (i) an energy gap, (ii) a peak at the gap energy \(\Delta\), (iii) a plateau between \(\Delta\) and an upper cutoff \(u\). Note that \(u\) is beyond the experimental energy range in (a). After the discovery of gaps in La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4+\delta}\),[31] similar gaps were found for La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\).[40] These gaps are all due to anisotropy and can be understood using conventional spin-wave theory. As \(\delta\) is increased for La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4+\delta}\), \(\Delta\) decreases from 3 meV to a value (\(<\!1.5\) meV) too small to be resolved in the present experiment. In addition to \(\Delta\), the cutoff \(u\) also decreases with increasing \(\delta\), from \(>\!10\) meV for \(\delta\!=\!0\) to 6 meV for \(\delta\!=\!0.077\). This is simply a consequence of the smaller spin-wave velocity at larger \(\delta\): as the spin waves become more resolved in \(q\) for fixed energy transfers, their contribution to the \(q\!=\!0\) scattering diminishes.

We have also performed some inelastic polarized beam experiments to determine whether there is any unusual continuum scattering of the type found in mixed valence and heavy-fermion (HF) systems.[41] Figure 12 shows the results for \(\delta\!=\!0.067\) (LN2). It is apparent that the inelastic spectrum of the inset in (a) is a coarsely resolved version of Fig. 11(b), with no measurable (though note the substantial error bars) magnetic scattering at \(\hbar\omega\!>\!15\) meV. Also, as expected for conventional antiferromagnets, the spin-flip scattering at the 2D antiferromagnetic [(10\(l\))] zone center has a maximum above \(T_{N}\) [see Fig. 12(b)]. Concommitantly, there is a steady decrease with \(T\) in the scattering at the ferromagnetic [(20\(l\))] zone center.

## VI Summary and Discussion

Table 2 summarizes our experimental results for comparison with those for La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) (all numbers except \(\Delta\) are from Ref. [30], \(\Delta\) is from Ref. [40]). Whereas Figure 13 shows the magnetic phase diagram of La\({}_{2}\)NiO\({}_{4+\delta}\) for samples made using the procedures described in Ref. [32].

Figure 11: **Constant-\(Q\) scans for crystals** (a) LN1 (\(\delta\!=\!0\)), (b) LN2 (\(\delta\!=\!0.067\)) and (c) LN3 (\(\delta\!=\!0.077\)) at \(T\!<\!T_{N}\).

Figure 10: Experimental spin-wave dispersion curves for LN1, LN2, and LN3. The spin-wave velocity, \(c\!=\!\omega/q\), decreases rapidly as 8 increases. The dispersion curve for La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) obtained from data of Ref. [30] is also included for comparison. The shaded region represents the spectrometer resolution ellipse. Note that the small anisotropy gaps between 0 and 3 meV, as seen in Fig. 11, are _not_ included in this figure.

  Room-temperature neutron powder diffraction data from stoichiometric La2NiO4 are consistent with orthorhombic _Bmab_ symmetry. Furthermore, the lattice parameters are in reasonable agreement with values reported in the literature,13 allowing for slight variations in the absolute oxygen stoichiometry. All nonstoichiometric samples are single-phase tetragonal (_14/mmm_) at room temperature, within the limits of resolution of the x-ray and neutron data. As d increases, the c parameter increases significantly, whereas basal lattice parameters decrease only very slightly in the tetragonal form. The stoichiometric sample has a significantly larger average basal lattice parameter, after adjusting for the \(\sqrt[3]{2} \times \sqrt[3]{2} \times 1\) supercell to obtain \(a_{T} = \sqrt[3]{ab}\) /2 = 3.891 A, than the nonstoichiometric compositions with \(a = 3.869\) A. The tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition temperature \(T_{S}\) decreases sharply with increasing d, from \(\sim 680\) K at d = 016 to \(< 200\) K for d = 0.077. Similarly, the splitting parameter (orthorhombic strain) decreases with increasing d.

The oxygen-defect concentrations in all of the nonstoichiometric specimens examined in the present study fall within the two-phase coexistence regime

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}  & & Powder & & & & \\  & & specimen & LN1 & LN2 & LN3 & La2CuO4+8 \\ Parameter & Unit & \(\delta \approx 0.065\) & \(\delta = 0.00\) & \(\delta = 0.067\) & \(\delta = 0.077\) & \(\delta \approx 0\) \\ \(a\) & Å (295 K) & 3.871(4) & 5.473(1)a & 3.8689(2) & 3.8685(2)  (0.02 < 6 < 0.13) described by Jorgensen _et al._13 for La2NiO4+_d_. The two-phase sample they described had an average oxygen excess concentration of d = 0.07, very similar to the values of the nonstoichiometric samples characterized in this investgation. Although structural refinements on our samples lead to agreement factors which are somewhat large (typically d-12 % for both neutron powder Rietveld and single-crystal x-ray refinements), apparently as a consequence of oxygen-defect correlations, the lattice parameters show no evidence of deviation from tetragonal symmetry or mixed phase composition. This striking inconsistency in phase behavior near d = 0.07 may arise from differing conditions of sample preparation. The nonstoichiometric samples used in this study were obtained "as-grown" from the central region of a 1.4-kg boule of skull-melted material; whereas, Jorgensen _et al._13 prepared their two-phase d = 0.07 sample by direct solid-state reaction of the binary oxides in oxygen at high temperature, followed by annealing in nitrogen at 450 degC. Although diffusivity data have not yet been reported for La2NiO4+_d_, it is likely that diffusion rates are low at 450 degC; therefore, it seems possible that either (i) the phase coexistence is due to the onset of phase separation with an upper consolute temperature (_T_ue) just above 450 degC, such that the time scale for cooling of the skull-melted boule from _T_ue to room temperature is insufficient to allow phase segregation to progress to a detectable level, or (ii) the kinetics of equilibrium of the sample of Jorgensen _et al._13 prevented equilibration of the stable phase at 450 degC under the residual oxygen fugacity of the nitrogen atmosphere. In either case, it is clear that the equilibrium oxygen concentration phase diagram and kinetics of the La2NiO4+_d_ system are poorly understood at present.

The stoichiometric crystal (LN1) has a Neel temperature well above room temperature, as expected on the basis of previous susceptibility studies. \(T_{N}\) falls rapidly with increasing oxygen-defect concentration, such that \(T_{N}\) < \(T_{S}\) for all nonstoichiometric samples studied. Based on susceptibility data, it appears that \(T_{N}\) (~650 K) (Ref. 25) < \(T_{S}\) (~680 K) (Ref. 16) in the stoichiometric limit also. For all compositions, the spin structure is collinear with the direction of propagation along [100], parallel to the octahedral rotation axis, as reported earlier.31 Since the undistorted tetragonal (_I_4/_mmm_) lattice offers no unique stacking arrangement for the antiferromagnetic sheets, correlations are suppressed by frustration until the structural transition breaks the degeneracy. Below \(T_{N}\), Ni moments in neighboring Ni-O planes are antiferromagnetically ordered in the more closely spaced (100) planes than in the (010) planes of the orthorhombic cell.

We have determined the magnetic moment of the powder sample (d = 0.065) to be 0.86(5)\(m_{B}\), which is significantly lower than the value of 1.62(5)\(m_{B}\) reported by Lander _et al._18 for stoichiometric La2NiO4+_d_. Thus, the 3D ordered moment becomes much smaller as d increased. Similar reductions occur in La2CuO4+_d_ (Refs. 34 and 43) and La2-_x_Sr_CuO4+_d_ (Ref. 44) with increasing d and \(x\), respectively. Recent local-spin-density calculations reported by Guo and Temmerman 45 predict that the moment in La2NiO4+_d_ should be sensitively dependent on the extent of octahedral rotation and the ratio of basal and apical Ni--O bond lengths, reflecting variations in hybridization of nickel \(d\) states and oxygen \(p\) states. However, in the case of the cuprates, the reduction in the 3D ordered moment is not accompanied by an equally large reduction in the frozen _local_ moment.46 This result makes a band-theoretic interpretation less tenable than explanations involving magnetic frustration derived from occasional ferromagnetic superexchange bonds due to holes localized on the planar oxygens.47 The relevant hypothesis for La2CuO4+_d_, La2NiO4+_d_, and Pr2NiO4+_d_ is that the O- (instead of O2-) ions in the basal planes are required by charge neutrality, as established assuming that the valences of the lanthanide and transition metal ions are fixed at their d = 0 values.

It is apparent that increasing the oxygen-defect concentration results in a pronounced reduction in both the Neel temperature and the spin-wave velocity. The onset of the tetragonal-orthorhombic transition and the magnitude of the orthorhombic splitting parameter are also sharply reduced. Similar results have been obtained for La2-_x_(Sr,Ba)_x_CuO4+_d_ (Refs. 30, 34, 38, 43, and 44) and Pr2NiO4+_d_.48 Thus in broad outline, the magnetic and structural properties of the layered nickelates differ little from those of the copper oxides. Nonetheless, the existence49 or absence of superconductivity in layered nickel oxides has not yet been conclusively demonstrated. If the layered nickel oxides are nonsuperconducting, then we conclude that the mechanism for high-_T__c_ superconductivity is either not magnetic, that it involves yet-to-be-established subtleties in the magnetic fluctuations of the cuprates, or that it requires a greater degree of delocalization than that present in the nickelates.
