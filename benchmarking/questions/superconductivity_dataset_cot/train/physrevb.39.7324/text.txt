###### Abstract

The temperature (\(T\)) dependence of the Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) is studied in Co-doped and Ni-doped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\), and Ni-doped La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\). In these systems we show that as the high-\(T_{c}\) behavior is suppressed, the unusual \(T\) dependence of \(R_{H}\) is also suppressed in a characteristic way. The evidence strongly suggest that the strong \(T\) dependence of \(R_{H}\) is an anomaly specific to the unconventional normal state in most, perhaps all, of the high-\(T_{c}\) oxides.

An important question regarding the high-\(T_{c}\) superconducting oxides[1] La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (2:1:4), YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) (1:2:3), Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O (Bi 2:2:1:2 or 2:2:2:3), and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O is whether conventional normal Fermi-liquid theory can account for the electronic properties in the normal state.[2] Anderson and co-workers[2, 3] and Fukuyama and Hasegawa[4] have emphasized that anomalous deviations from familiar Fermi-liquid behavior are to be expected because the charge carriers are strongly correlated, and one has to start from a ground state different from a Fermi liquid. In contrast, several attempts[5, 6] have been made to explain the transport data using conventional Bloch-Boltzmann models based on band structure. The linear temperature (\(T\)) dependence of the resistivity \(\rho\) has been widely discussed in this context.[3] Here we present experimental evidence that the Hall effect is also strikingly anomalous in the high-\(T_{c}\) oxides containing CuO\({}_{2}\) sheets. By studying the Hall coefficient \(R_{H}\) in a large range of samples under different doping conditions we infer that there is a distinct correlation between the characteristic[7, 8, 9]\(R_{H}\) vs \(T\) profile and high-\(T_{c}\) behavior. (In 1:2:3 the \(T\) dependence is strong: \(R_{H}\)\(\sim\)\(1/T\); in other high-\(T_{c}\) oxides the \(T\) dependence is weaker.) When the superconductivity is suppressed by dopants we find that the slope of \(n_{H}\) vs \(T\) (\(n_{H}\) = 1/\(eR_{H}\)) is suppressed as well. The correlation follows a similar pattern in both Ni- and Co-doped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) as well as in La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) doped with Ni. The accumulated evidence suggest that a \(T\) dependent \(n_{H}\) is a generic property of an unusual ground state that occurs in most (possibly all) of the high-\(T_{c}\) oxides comprised of CuO\({}_{2}\) planes, and _not_ an accident of particular band arrangements, or overlapping bands. Furthermore, the \(T\) dependence of \(n_{H}\) is suppressed whenever \(T_{c}\) is reduced by chemical doping.

The Ni- and Co-doped 1:2:3 samples are from the same pellets as the samples previously studied using structural, chemical, and magnetic measurements.[10, 11] Powder x-ray diffraction verified all samples to be single phase. For two doping levels of the Co-doped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) samples (\(x\) = 0.2, 0.8), the Co sites and the oxygen content were determined by neutron powder diffraction.[11] From the neutron results Co is known to substitute for Cu(1) (chain sites). Thermogravimetry data indicate that Ni substitutes for Cu(2) (plane sites).[10] The carrier density \(n\) is dramatically decreased with Co doping whereas it is not significantly affected by Ni doping.[12]

Figure 1 shows the \(T\) dependence of \(n_{H}\) (per unit cell) for the Co-doped samples (\(x\) = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.) As in undoped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\), \(n_{H}\) in the \(x\) = 0.02 sample shows a distinctive linear-\(T\) dependence which extends to 300 K. The trend in Fig. 1 suggests that as \(x\) increases, the average slope \(dn_{H}/dT\) decreases until it becomes negligible at large \(x\). Over the same range of \(x\), \(T_{c}\) decreases sharply from 93 to 22 K (for \(x\) = 0.3).[10] If the observed

The data for \(x\) = 0.3 (open circles) is replotted enlarged by a factor of 10 to show the weak \(T\) dependence. The slopes rapidly decrease as \(x\) increases. Lines are drawn to guide the eye. See Refs. [10] and [11] for \(T_{c}\) vs \(x\).

 \(n_{H}\) is \(T\) independent it is a reasonable assumption that \(n_{H}\) provides a reliable estimate of \(n\). Thus, for the \(x\) = 0.3 sample we infer that \(n\) is close to 0.07 holes/cell, which implies that Co doping dramatically reduces the itinerant hole population. (Further discussion of this point appears in Ref. [12].)

In the limit \(x\rightarrow\) 0, however, the strong \(T\) dependence of \(R_{H}\) makes any attempt to extract \(n\) from \(n_{H}\) problematical. We argue below that the strong \(T\) dependence arises from an anomalous Hall current associated with the carriers responsible for the high-\(T_{c}\) instability. The anomalous Hall scattering obscures the ordinary Hall current, which can only be detected when the high-\(T_{c}\) mechanism is suppressed.

In Ni-doped 1:2:3, \(T_{c}\) also decreases with increasing \(x\), although to a lesser degree at large \(x\) (\(T_{c}\) \(\sim\) 58 K at 0.4.) In Fig. 2 we show the variation of \(n_{H}\) vs \(T\) for the Ni-doped samples. As in Fig. 1 we find that the linear \(T\) behavior of \(n_{H}\) (dashed line in Fig. 2) is rapidly converted to a less \(T\)-dependent curve as \(x\) increases from 0.02 to 0.4. To highlight the suppression of the \(T\) dependence, we plot in Fig. 3 (top curve) the variation of the slope \(dn_{H}/dT\) at 100 K with \(x\). As \(x\) increases to 0.4, the slope decreases by a factor of 4. However, in contrast with the Co case, the overall change in the value of \(n_{H}\) at 100 K is rather slight. For the \(x\) = 0.4 sample, the curve appears to saturate at low \(T\) to a value slightly less than 1 hole/cell (compared with 0.07/cell for the \(x\) = 0.3 sample in Fig. 1). This point is emphasized by plotting \(n_{H}\) vs \(x\) at several fixed \(T\) (see Fig. 3). Although the curves show an interesting peak near \(x\) = 0.05, they all converge to the value \(n_{H}\) \(\sim\) 1 hole/cell at high \(x\). Also shown in Fig. 3 (dashed line) is the extrapolated value of \(n_{H}\) as \(T\) \(\rightarrow\) 0. We next argue that the data in Fig. 3 enables us to deduce \(n\) in "pure" YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\). When \(x\) exceeds \(\sim\)0.3, the anomalous \(T\) dependence of \(n_{H}\) is removed, so that we can identify \(n_{H}\) with \(n\). Further, since Ni doping does not change the hole density, we infer that \(n\) in undoped 1:2:3 equals the value \(n_{H}\) observed in the \(x\) = 0.4 sample, i.e., 1 hole/cell. (In effect, Ni doping enables us to suppress the anomalous \(T\) dependence without changing \(n\).) Thus, the two cases (Co and Ni) suggest similar trends: When the conditions favorable to high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity are removed the anomalous linear \(n_{H}\) vs \(T\) behavior is also suppressed, leaving only a \(T\)-independent Hall resistivity. Similar considerations[13] apply to the Hall effect in oxygen-doped[9] YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-y}\).

Previous studies of the Hall effect[14, 15, 16] in the 40-K system La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) found that \(R_{H}\) is \(T\) independent at low concentrations of Sr (\(x\) \(<\) 0.1). On the basis of the data in Figs. 1 and 2, we were encouraged to search for a similar pattern of behavior in the 40-K system. Published work[17] shows that, at a fixed Sr concentration \(x\) = 0.16, very slight amounts (\(y\)) of Ni suppress \(T_{c}\) from 38 K (\(y\) = 0) to under 4 K (\(x\) = 0.05). Our data on \(n_{H}\) for four samples within this doping range are shown in Fig. 4. In the absence of Ni (\(y\) = 0), \(n_{H}\) increases by 67% as \(T\) increases from 50 to 200 K. However, when Ni is added, the slope \(dn_{H}/dT\) is systematically suppressed, in accord with our expectations. As in Fig. 2, \(n_{H}\) is independent of \(y\) at low \(T\); this again suggests that Ni does not change

Lower curves: Variation of the Hall number with \(x\) at constant temperature. The data points are interpolations of measurements reported in Fig. 2. The dashed line indicates the extrapolation of the data to \(T\) = 0. In the text, the strong suppression of the slope with \(x\) is interpreted as quenching of the anomalous contribution to the Hall current. At high \(x\), only the normal Hall current component remains.

Solid lines are drawn through the data for higher concentration samples. The slopes rapidly suppressed as \(x\) increases. However, the Hall number at \(x\) = 0.4 remains fairly large (\(\sim\)1 hole/cell) unlike the Co case. See Ref. [12] for \(T_{c}\) vs \(x\).

  despite the strong effects on \(T_{c}\) and \(dn_{H}/dT\). [The small amount of Ni (\(<\) 5%) needed to suppress the slope in Fig. 4 also argues against a band-filling mechanism. Instead, we propose that the Ni impurities are disrupting a coherent scattering effect which is responsible for both the anomalous Hall current and the high-\(T_{c}\) instability.]

In all the known high-\(T_{c}\) oxides based on CuO\({}_{2}\) planes, \(R_{H}\) is positive and decreases with increasing \(T\). In "two-plane" Bi-2:2:1:2 with \(T_{c}\) = 85 K, Takagi _et al._[18] have shown that the decrease in \(R_{H}\) is weaker than 1/\(T\). For the "three-plane" systems based on Bi and Tl, \(R_{H}\) also decreases with increasing \(T\), but sample difficulties preclude an accurate determination of the \(T\) dependence.[19] At present the importance of several factors affecting \(T_{c}\) (such as the interlayer coupling strength, doping conditions, in-plane lattice disorder, and \(n\) itself) remain to be sorted out. Hence, we are unable to compare meaningfully the magnitude of the slope \(dn_{H}/dT\) in different compounds, even those with similar \(T_{c}\)'s. Nonetheless, for each compound separately, \(dn_{H}/dT\) is strongly correlated with \(T_{c}\). (See note added below on Bi-2:2:1:2.)

By itself, the prevalence of a \(T\) dependence in \(n_{H}\) in the high-\(T_{c}\) oxides can only suggest that this transport property should be regarded as a property intrinsic to high-\(T_{c}\) systems. What we have shown here is that the converse is true as well. When high-\(T_{c}\) behavior is intentionally suppressed in a particular compound, the \(T\) dependence of \(n_{H}\) is also removed. These two conditions, applying to systems with rather different band structures, pose severe difficulties for Bloch-Boltzmann theories which attempt to explain the \(T\) dependence of \(n_{H}\) using fortuitous cancellation in multiple bands.[6] (It is unlikely that such accidental cancellations occur both in 1:2:3, as well as in 2:1:4 which has CuO\({}_{2}\) planes only. Further, we point out that the compensation models,[6] with roughly equal \(\sigma_{xy}\) for electrons and holes, predict that as the chemical potential is raised by doping, the electron pocket should expand at the expense of the hole pocket. Thus, \(R_{H}\) should decrease towards negative values, in contradiction with the data in Fig. 1. This argument persuades us that in 1:2:3, only one band contributes to the electronic transport.) In the limit of strong suppression of \(T_{c}\) what is the nature of the ground state? Since the \(\rho\) vs \(T\) profile remains linear in \(T\) (down to 20 K in Fig. 4, inset), the evidence suggests that the system remains "unconventional." The low-temperature transport properties of this unconventional system is largely unknown.

In the opposite direction of decreasing impurities, the \(T\) dependence of \(n_{H}\) becomes more pronounced as \(T_{c}\) increases in all the cases studied. We speculate that the strong \(T\) dependence arises from an anomalous Hall current which dominates the conventional Lorentz term. The anomalous term may arise from an as-yet unknown asymmetric scattering mechanism associated with the unusual spin-zero current-carrying excitations discussed below, and is thus specific to the particular ground state of these unusual oxides. The anomalous Hall component is unlikely to receive an explanation using conventional Fermi-liquid theory, which ignores the effects of strong correlation. [Because \(R_{H}\) neither varies as \(\chi\) (susceptibility) nor as \(\rho^{2}\), we also do not think that conventional magnetic skew scattering can account for the anomalous behavior.]

We next discuss a scenario for the Ni doping which is suggested by the Hall data. In undoped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) there is one itinerant hole per cell, which goes into the planes,[12] (i.e., Cu ions on chain sites are all in the +2 state, consistent with neutron scattering results[11]). The hole, which resides in states mainly \(2p\) in character,[20] forms a \(d^{\prime}2\) orbital around a Cu(2) ion. If the Ni impurity is divalent (\(d^{8}\)) the number of ligand holes must remain unchanged because the chemical potential is pinned by the reservoir of electrons in the \(2p\) ligand states. [Cu(2) ions at other sites pick up a formal valence of +3.]

Zhang and Rice and Eskes and Sawatsky[21] have shown that with hybridization the ligand hole forms a _singlet_ state with the \(s\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\) spin on the Cu site which is more deeply bound than the nonbonding state. The effective Hamiltonian reduces to the single-band Hubbard model, in agreement with Anderson's original picture.[2] We next consider the hybridization at a Ni\({}^{2+}\) impurity site. Because the \(3d\) level of Ni is situated much higher than Cu(\(3d\)), the \(3d\)-\(2p\) hybridization is greatly reduced, and the singlet bound state with a ligand hole is not energetically favorable, i.e., the Ni site becomes _inaccessible_ to the singlet hybrid state. If we assume that this singlet state is essential to both the high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity _and_ the anomalous Hall current, we can correlate the Hall data with the destruction of the singlet band by the proliferation of inaccessible sites. [The superconductivity may be quite sensitive to the loss of available sites because of the unusually short coherence length (\(\xi\) \(\sim\) 10 A).]

Figure 4: The temperature dependence of \(n_{H}V\) (\(V\) = 190 Å\({}^{3}\)) in four samples of La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{1-y}\)Ni\({}_{y}\)O\({}_{4}\) (\(x\) = 0.16). As in Fig. 2, the slope \(dn_{H}/dT\) is systematically suppressed as \(T_{c}\) decreases. The \(\rho\) vs \(T\) profile (inset) shows that the slope \(dp/dT\) is unchanged by Ni doping (content indicated by symbols). The \(T_{c}\)’s are 37, 24, and 15 K.

  _Note added_. After completion of this work we learned of the data of Matsuda _et al._[22] on \(n_{H}\) in Pr-doped 1:2:3, which also show the slope suppression of \(n_{H}\) vs \(T\) with increasing dopant content, as discussed here. We have also extended[12] the doping study to Bi\({}_{4}\)Sr\({}_{7}\)Ca\({}_{3-x}\)Tm\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{4}\)O\({}_{16+y}\), and find that as \(x\)(Tm) increases, \(n_{H}\) decreases linearly, extrapolating to zero at \(x\) = 1.4. The correlation between the slope \(dn_{H}/dT\) and \(T_{c}\) discussed here is also verified in this system.
