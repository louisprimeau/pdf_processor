###### Abstract

Strontium intercalation between van der Waals bonded layers of the
topological insulator Bi₂Se₃ is found to induce superconductivity with a
maximum T_(c) of 2.9 K. Transport measurement on a single crystal of the
optimally doped sample Sr_(1.0)Bi₂Se₃ shows weak anisotropy (Γ ∼ 1.5)
and an upper critical field H_(c2)(0) equal to 2.1 T for a magnetic
field applied perpendicular to the c axis of the sample. The
Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths are found to be ξ_(ab) = 15.3 nm and
ξ_(c) = 10.2 nm. The lower critical field H_(c1, ab)(0) and zero
temperature penetration depth λ_(ab)(0) are estimated to be 0.39 ± 0.02
mT and 1221 ± 36 nm, respectively. Hall and Seebeck measurements confirm
the dominance of electronic conduction, and the carrier concentration is
surprisingly low (n = 1.85 × 10³⁹ cm⁻³) at 10 K, indicating the
possibility of unconventional superconductivity.

## I Introduction

Superconductors derived from topological insulating phases of quantum
matter are among the most profound developments of the recent past [1,
2, 3]. Extensively studied three-dimensional topological insulators
(TIs), such as Bi₂Se₃ and SnTe, are characterized by gapless spin
polarized surface states that emerge from the peculiar topology of an
insulating bulk band structure [4]. These surface states show a
Dirac-like linear dispersion with the spin polarization locked
perpendicular to the electron momentum [5]. Correspondingly, theoretical
predictions on a superconducting analog, a fully gapped odd parity
pairing state with gapless Majorana surface states, have attracted
significant attention [4]. In this Rapid Communication we describe the
synthesis and extensive electromagnetic characterization of one such
possible example: superconductivity in Sr-intercalated Bi₂Se₃.

Pristine Bi₂Se₃ is a wide band semiconductor with a layered crystal
structure. It is made from double layers of BiSe₆ octahedra
($R^{3}\overline{3}m$, space group 166) consisting of stacked
Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers. These are weakly van der Waals bonded
to the neighboring set of layers [6]. As seen in other chalcogenides
[7], this layered structure leads to intercalative chemical
maneuverings, and topological superconductivity (T_(c) ∼ 3.5 K) has been
reported in Cu-intercalated Bi₂Se₃ (Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃, 0.12 < x < 0.15)
[1,2]. Further, at high pressure, Bi₂Te₃, Bi₂Se₃, and Sb₂Te₃ are
reported to be superconducting [8, 9, 10]. A recent study on In-doped
SnTe has also shown superconductivity with a T_(c) of ∼4.5 K [11, 12].
Very recently, intercalation of Sr in Bi₂Se₃ was reported with
T_(c) ∼ 2.5 K, with a large shielding fraction of 88

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Sr_(x)Bi₂Se₃ for x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20 were
prepared by melting stoichiometric amounts of high purity elements of Bi
(99.999

## III Result and Discussion

Figure (a) shows the x-ray diffraction (XRD) data along the basal plane
reflections from Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃. The sharp peaks along (00′) confirm
single crystalline growth of the sample. All the samples were subjected
to EDAX, and the pattern for Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃ is shown in inset (i) of
Fig. 1(a). A quantitative analysis of the EDAX acquired through several
points on the sample surface gave the percentage of the element close to
stoichiometric values. For example, for Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃, the average
atomic percentages of Sr, Bi, and Se are found to be 1

XRD data of Sr_(x)Bi₂Se₃ samples (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) were
Rietveld refined by fullprof software using reported Wyckoff positions
[14]. The main panel of Fig. 1(b) shows the refined XRD patterns of
Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃. The Bi₂Se₃ system crystallizes in a rhombohedral
structure with the space group R³ m. It is understood that the Sr atom
in the van der Waals gap goes to octahedrally coordinated 3b (0.0, 1/2)
sites [2,7]. Two impurity phases, BiSe and SrBi₂Se₄, are also present in
the samples, and their concentration grows with an increase in Sr
percentage. These impurity phases have been taken into account for
better refinement. The percentage compositions of each phase in the
optimally doped sample with x = 0.1 are Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃ = 90.97

The superlattice pattern in the electron diffraction measurements is a
strong indicator of intercalation [16]. Inset (iii) in Fig. 1(b) shows
the diffraction pattern for Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃, which demonstrates a
diffused, azimuthal spread of the superlattice satellite spots
associated with each Bi₂Se₃ Bragg spot. The diffuse nature of the spots
suggests a lower intercalant concentration, and the azimuthal spread is
due to the large atomic radii of Sr [16]. Insets (iv) and (v) show the
HRTEM images for Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃ along the (009) and (006) planes,
respectively. The HRTEM shows no sign of stacking faults, intergrowths,
or amorphous regions. The d values measured from the fringes for
Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃ corresponding to the (009) and (006) planes are 3.18 and
4.78 A, respectively. In inset (v) the width of the dark lines
corresponds to the distance between the quintuple layers. Moreover,
there is a small and broad gap between the fringes that appears
alternatively. The broader gap corresponds to the spacing between two
quintuple layers (QLs), as shown in schematic for the (006) plane [Fig.
1(b)(v)]. The measured spacing of 2.23 A from the HRTEM image
corroborates well with the XRD result.

The dc magnetization measured for Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃ with H ∥ ab under zero
field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) protocols using a 5 G magnetic
field is shown in inset (a) of Fig. 2. The onset of the diamagnetic
signal is marked at 2.67 K. The superconducting shielding fraction is
about 93

Figure 2: (Color online) The M-H loop with the H ∥ ab plane at 1.65 K is
shown for Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃. In inset (a) the dc susceptibilities measured
with the H ∥ ab plane under ZFC (red) and FC (blue) conditions are
plotted for the 5 G field. Inset (b) shows the dc magnetization graphs
under ZFC for x = 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 Sr-intercalated Bi₂Se₃ samples.
Inset (c) shows the lower critical field H_(c1) data points (black) and
the parabolic fitting (red) line. Inset (d) shows the M-H scan in the
low field range at T = 1.69, 1.9, 1.97, 2.0, 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 K.

Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃. The Bragg position for impurity phases SrBi₂Se₄ and BiSe
are marked. Inset (iii) shows the diffraction pattern of Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃.

linearity in the diamagnetic state. Using this criterion, a set of
H_(c)^(′)(T) with H ∥ ab was estimated and fitted to the parabolic T
dependence H_(c1)^(′)(T) = H_(c1)^(′)(0)(1 − (T/T_(c))²], and the
experimental lower critical field H_(c1, ab)^(′)(0) is estimated to be
0.35 ± 0.01 mT. This is shown in inset (c) of Fig. 2. Although the
demagnetization effect is small for H ∥ ab, the corrected value of the
lower critical field H_(c1) after demagnetization correction was
calculated from H_(c1)^(′)(0) by using Brandt’s formula
$H_{c1}(0)=H^{\prime}_{c1}(0)/\tanh\sqrt{0.36b/a}$ for approximate slab
geometry [17]. For the aspect ratio b/a = 3/0.5, H_(c1 ∥ ab)(0) comes
out to be 0.39 ± 0.02 mT, which is used for further quantitative
analysis.

In Fig. 3 we summarize the magnetotransport measurements. The inset in
Fig. 3(a) shows the resistivity from low temperature to room temperature
of Sr_(x)Bi₂Se₃. For Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃, we find a T_(c − onset) = 2.94 K
and T_(c − zero) = 2.8 K. This is higher by ∼0.35 K as compared to a
previous report [13]. A further increase in Sr concentration does not
significantly affect the resistive T_(c), but the impurity concentration
goes up. The resistivity of Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃ is linear in the entire
temperature range with a residual resistivity ρ₀ = 0.368 × 10⁻³ G m. A
sharp superconducting transition with a transition width
ΔT_(c) = T_(c − onset) − T_(c − zero) = 0.16 K [inset of Fig. 3(b)] and
residual resistivity ratio (ρ_(300 K)/ρ_(3 K) = 1.95) are observed. As
shown in the main panel of Fig. 3, with the application of an external
magnetic field, a larger shift in the superconducting transition is
observed for the H ∥ c axis than for the H ∥ ab plane. This behavior is
reflective of anisotropic transport in layered superconductors, as
evidenced in Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃ as well [2].

From the onset and offset data of the superconducting transition in the
presence of magnetic fields (Fig. 3), in the inset of Fig. 4 we plot the
upper critical field (H_(c2)) and the irreversibility field (H_(int)) as
a function of temperature. The standard criterion used for these
estimations is described elsewhere [18]. Further, in a weak coupling
case, the Pauli limited upper critical field is given by
H_(P)(0) = 1.84T_(c) = 5.15 T. Under the generalized Ginzburg-Landau
model, H_(c2)(T) = H_(c2)(0)([1 − t²)/(1 + t²)], where t = T/T_(c). In
the main panel of Fig. 4, fitting of our data to this equation gives
H_(c2) ∥ ab(0) = 2.1 ± 0.025 T (red line) and
H_(c2) ∥ c(0) = 1.4 ± 0.035 T (blue line). In conventional single band
Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory, [19] the orbital limited upper
critical field of the type- II superconductor in the clean limit is
described by H_(c2) = −0.72T_(c)(dH_(c2)/dT)_(T_(c)) and is estimated to
be 1.6 T for H ∥ ab. Since H_(c0)^(orb)(0) < H_(c2)(0) < H_(P)(0), the
superconductivity in Sr_(0.1)Bi₂Se₃ is Pauli limited. With a Maki
parameter $\alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}(0)/H_{P}(0)$ of less than
1, the Flude-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is
reflective of the spatially modulated order parameter, is not indicated
[20]. The electronic anisotropy parameter
Γ ≡ H_(c2, ab)/H_(c2, c) = λ_(c)/λ_(ab) is about 1.5, and using the
anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau formulas [21]H_(c2, ab) = Φ₀/(2πξ_(ab)ξ_(c))
and H_(c2, c) = Φ₀/(2πξ_(ab)²), with Φ₀ = 2.07 × 10⁻⁷ G m², the
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence lengths are estimated as
ξ_(ab) = 15.3 ± 0.1 nm and ξ_(c) = 10.2 ± 0.1 nm. The GL parameters
along the two field directions are defined as
$\kappa_{ab}=\sqrt{\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c}/\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}}$ and
κ_(c) = λ_(ab)/ξ_(ab)[22, 23, 24]. Using
H_(c1, ab) = (Φ₀/4Tλ_(ab)λ_(c))(ln κ_(ab) + 0.5)[25] and GL formulas,
H_(c2, ab)/H_(c1, ab) = X_(c2)/(ln κ_(ab) + 0.5) gives
κ_(ab) = 119.2 ± 2.6. Further, from the H_(c1, ab) formula and
λ_(c) = Γλ_(ab) we get λ_(ab)(0) = 1221 ± 36 nm.

surprising to see superconductivity at 2.9 K with such a low carrier
concentration, and most likely a non-BCS mechanism is at play, as is the
case in Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃[26]. The normal state magnetoresistance (not shown)
was found to be nonlinear for fields up to 12 T.

The low temperature Hall measurement in combination with
temperature-dependent thermoelectric power (TEP) data can be used to
estimate the effective mass of carriers m^(*) and the Sommerfeld
constant γ[18]. Using a simplistic free electron model and with an
electron carrier concentration n = 1.58 × 10²⁵ m⁻³ at 50 K, the Fermi
energy (temperature) comes out to be 23 meV (266.8 K). In low carrier
concentration metals, the Seebeck coefficient is given by the Mott
expression S = π²k_(B)T/(2eT_(F)), where T_(F) is the Fermi temperature
[27, 28]. Using T_(F) = 266.8 K in this expression yields a Seebeck
coefficient of −80μV K⁻¹ at 50 K, which is larger than the measured
value of −19μV K⁻¹. This implies an effective mass of electron
m^(*) = 0.24m_(e) and a corresponding value of the Sommerfeld constant γ
equal to 4.0 J/m³ K². The value of m^(*) is 1.85 times higher than its
value in the parent Bi₂Se₃, as calculated from angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)
measurements [29, 30]. We note that the mean free path for charge
carriers is given by the relation l = hk_(F)/2πρ₀ne²[2, 26]. Taking
ρ₀ = 0.368 × 10⁻⁵Ω m and n = 1.85 × 10²⁵ m⁻³ at 10 K, and assuming a
spherical Fermi surface with a wave vector
k_(F) = (3π²n)^(1/3) = 8.2 × 10⁸ m⁻¹, the mean free path l is estimated
to be 49.4 nm, which is greater than ξ_(ab) and ξ_(c). This confirms
that our sample is in the clean limit.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we report superconductivity in the Sr-intercalated
topological insulator Bi₂Se₃ with a Sr concentration in the range
0.1 < x < 0.2. This is achieved at a surprisingly low carrier
concentration of 1.85 × 10¹⁹ cm⁻³. An about 93
