###### Abstract

Strontium intercalation between van der Waals bonded layers of the topological insulator Bi_{2}Se_{3} is found to induce superconductivity with a maximum T_{c} of 2.9 K. Transport measurement on a single crystal of the optimally doped sample Sr_{1.0}Bi_{2}Se_{3} shows weak anisotropy (\Gamma\sim 1.5) and an upper critical field H_{c2}(0) equal to 2.1 T for a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the c axis of the sample. The Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths are found to be \xi_{ab}=15.3 nm and \xi_{c}=10.2 nm. The lower critical field H_{c1,ab}(0) and zero temperature penetration depth \lambda_{ab}(0) are estimated to be 0.39\pm 0.02 mT and 1221\pm 36 nm, respectively. Hall and Seebeck measurements confirm the dominance of electronic conduction, and the carrier concentration is surprisingly low (n=1.85\times 10^{39} cm^{-3}) at 10 K, indicating the possibility of unconventional superconductivity.

## I Introduction

Superconductors derived from topological insulating phases of quantum matter are among the most profound developments of the recent past [1, 2, 3]. Extensively studied three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), such as Bi_{2}Se_{3} and SnTe, are characterized by gapless spin polarized surface states that emerge from the peculiar topology of an insulating bulk band structure [4]. These surface states show a Dirac-like linear dispersion with the spin polarization locked perpendicular to the electron momentum [5]. Correspondingly, theoretical predictions on a superconducting analog, a fully gapped odd parity pairing state with gapless Majorana surface states, have attracted significant attention [4]. In this Rapid Communication we describe the synthesis and extensive electromagnetic characterization of one such possible example: superconductivity in Sr-intercalated Bi_{2}Se_{3}.

Pristine Bi_{2}Se_{3} is a wide band semiconductor with a layered crystal structure. It is made from double layers of BiSe_{6} octahedra (R^{3}\overline{3}m, space group 166) consisting of stacked Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers. These are weakly van der Waals bonded to the neighboring set of layers [6]. As seen in other chalcogenides [7], this layered structure leads to intercalative chemical maneuverings, and topological superconductivity (T_{c}\sim 3.5 K) has been reported in Cu-intercalated Bi_{2}Se_{3} (Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, 0.12<x<0.15) [1,2]. Further, at high pressure, Bi_{2}Te_{3}, Bi_{2}Se_{3}, and Sb_{2}Te_{3} are reported to be superconducting [8, 9, 10]. A recent study on In-doped SnTe has also shown superconductivity with a T_{c} of \sim4.5 K [11, 12]. Very recently, intercalation of Sr in Bi_{2}Se_{3} was reported with T_{c}\sim 2.5 K, with a large shielding fraction of 88% [13]. In this Rapid Communication we report a successful synthesis of single crystals of Sr-intercalated Sr_{3}Bi_{2}Se_{3} with an optimal T_{c} of 2.9 K for x=0.1.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} for x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20 were prepared by melting stoichiometric amounts of high purity elements of Bi (99.999%), Se (99.999%), and Sr (99%) at 850 degC in sealed evacuated quartz tubes for 8 days, followed by slow cooling to 650 degC at a rate of 10 degC/h. The sample was then quenched in ice water. The obtained crystals were silvery and shiny with a mircrilike surface and were easily cleaved along the basal plane of the crystal. The samples remained silvery and shiny even after exposure to air for a long time, unlike Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, where the sample surface turned golden brown after 1 day exposure to air [2]. The dimensions of the cleaved Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} crystals were approximately 3\times 2\times 0.5 mm^{3}. The samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction at room temperature using a Rigaku powder x-ray diffractometer (Miniflex-600 with CuKa radiation). Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained from a Bruker AXS microanalyzer and from a Zeiss EVO40 SEM analyzer, respectively. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurement was done using a JEOL (JEM-2100F) transmission electron microscope. Resistivity, Hall, and magnetization measurements were carried out using a 14 T _Cryogenics_ physical property measurement system (PPMS). The Seebeck coefficient was measured from room temperature down to 50 K using a home-built setup. As discussed below, in transport and magnetization measurements, it was confirmed that x=0.1 is the optimal sample with a large superconducting shielding fraction, and in this Rapid Communication we emphasize on this composition.

## III Result and Discussion

Figure (a) shows the x-ray diffraction (XRD) data along the basal plane reflections from Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. The sharp peaks along (00\prime) confirm single crystalline growth of the sample. All the samples were subjected to EDAX, and the pattern for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is shown in inset (i) of Fig. 1(a). A quantitative analysis of the EDAX acquired through several points on the sample surface gave the percentage of the element close to stoichiometric values. For example, for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, the average atomic percentages of Sr, Bi, and Se are found to be 1%, 38%, and 61%, respectively. All the samples show a characteristic layered morphology, as seen in inset (ii) of Fig. 1(a). The schematic unit cell of Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is also included.

XRD data of Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} samples (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) were Rietveld refined by fullprof software using reported Wyckoff positions [14]. The main panel of Fig. 1(b) shows the refined XRD patterns of Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. The Bi_{2}Se_{3} system crystallizes in a rhombohedral structure with the space group R^{3}\!m. It is understood that the Sr atom in the van der Waals gap goes to octahedrally coordinated 3b (0.0,1/2) sites [2,7]. Two impurity phases, BiSe and SrBi_{2}Se_{4}, are also present in the samples, and their concentration grows with an increase in Sr percentage. These impurity phases have been taken into account for better refinement. The percentage compositions of each phase in the optimally doped sample with x=0.1 are Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} = 90.97%, BiSe = 7.05%, and SrBi_{2}Se_{4} = 1.98%. The refined lattice constants of Bi_{2}Se_{3}, a=4.14 A and c=28.64 A, are in agreement with reported data [13,15]. Evidently, the c axis increases after Sr intercalation with a=4.14 A and c=28.65 A for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}[13]. The overall volume of the unit cell was found to increase from 425.22 to 425.38, 425.40, 426.20, and 426.55 A^{3} for x=0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2, respectively. This confirms successful intercalation of Sr into Bi_{2}Se_{3} for 0.05<x<0.2.

The superlattice pattern in the electron diffraction measurements is a strong indicator of intercalation [16]. Inset (iii) in Fig. 1(b) shows the diffraction pattern for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, which demonstrates a diffused, azimuthal spread of the superlattice satellite spots associated with each Bi_{2}Se_{3} Bragg spot. The diffuse nature of the spots suggests a lower intercalant concentration, and the azimuthal spread is due to the large atomic radii of Sr [16]. Insets (iv) and (v) show the HRTEM images for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} along the (009) and (006) planes, respectively. The HRTEM shows no sign of stacking faults, intergrowths, or amorphous regions. The d values measured from the fringes for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} corresponding to the (009) and (006) planes are 3.18 and 4.78 A, respectively. In inset (v) the width of the dark lines corresponds to the distance between the quintuple layers. Moreover, there is a small and broad gap between the fringes that appears alternatively. The broader gap corresponds to the spacing between two quintuple layers (QLs), as shown in schematic for the (006) plane [Fig. 1(b)(v)]. The measured spacing of 2.23 A from the HRTEM image corroborates well with the XRD result.

The dc magnetization measured for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} with H\parallel ab under zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) protocols using a 5 G magnetic field is shown in inset (a) of Fig. 2. The onset of the diamagnetic signal is marked at 2.67 K. The superconducting shielding fraction is about 93%, as measured from ZFC data. The magnetization data taken in the FC measurement do not show significant flux trapping, implying the absence of effective pinning centers in the single crystals. Inset (b) of Fig. 2 shows the same measurement for the x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} samples. All the samples within the composition range 0.1<x<0.2 showed superconductivity with a maximum of 2.75 K for x=0.2, but the superconducting shielding fraction decreased with an increase in the Sr concentration. The M-H loop with H\parallel ab at 1.65 K shown in the main panel of Fig. 2 reflects type-II superconductivity with an identifiable irreversibility and upper critical fields. Inset (d) in Fig. 2 shows the M-H scan in a smaller field range at different temperatures towards measuring the lower critical field, which is marked by a deviation from

In inset (a) the dc susceptibilities measured with the H\parallel ab plane under ZFC (red) and FC (blue) conditions are plotted for the 5 G field. Inset (b) shows the dc magnetization graphs under ZFC for x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 Sr-intercalated Bi_{2}Se_{3} samples. Inset (c) shows the lower critical field H_{c1} data points (black) and the parabolic fitting (red) line. Inset (d) shows the M-H scan in the low field range at T=1.69, 1.9, 1.97, 2.0, 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 K.

The schematic unit cell is also included. The main panel of (b) shows refined XRD patterns for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. The Bragg position for impurity phases SrBi_{2}Se_{4} and BiSe are marked. Inset (iii) shows the diffraction pattern of Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. In inset (iv) the HRTEM images show (009) planes. The HRTEM image of inset (v) shows (006) planes.

  linearity in the diamagnetic state. Using this criterion, a set of H^{\prime}_{c}(T) with H\parallel ab was estimated and fitted to the parabolic T dependence H^{\prime}_{c1}(T)=H^{\prime}_{c1}(0)(1-(T/T_{c})^{2}], and the experimental lower critical field H^{\prime}_{c1,ab}(0) is estimated to be 0.35\pm 0.01 mT. This is shown in inset (c) of Fig. 2. Although the demagnetization effect is small for H\parallel ab, the corrected value of the lower critical field H_{c1} after demagnetization correction was calculated from H^{\prime}_{c1}(0) by using Brandt's formula H_{c1}(0)=H^{\prime}_{c1}(0)/\tanh\sqrt{0.36b/a} for approximate slab geometry [17]. For the aspect ratio b/a=3/0.5, H_{c1\parallel ab}(0) comes out to be 0.39\pm 0.02 mT, which is used for further quantitative analysis.

In Fig. 3 we summarize the magnetotransport measurements. The inset in Fig. 3(a) shows the resistivity from low temperature to room temperature of Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. For Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, we find a T_{c-\text{onset}}=2.94 K and T_{c-\text{zero}}=2.8 K. This is higher by \sim0.35 K as compared to a previous report [13]. A further increase in Sr concentration does not significantly affect the resistive T_{c}, but the impurity concentration goes up. The resistivity of Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is linear in the entire temperature range with a residual resistivity \rho_{0}=0.368\times 10^{-3} G m. A sharp superconducting transition with a transition width \Delta T_{c}=T_{c-\text{onset}}-T_{c-\text{zero}}=0.16 K [inset of Fig. 3(b)] and residual resistivity ratio (\rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{3\text{ K}}=1.95) are observed. As shown in the main panel of Fig. 3, with the application of an external magnetic field, a larger shift in the superconducting transition is observed for the H\parallel c axis than for the H\parallel ab plane. This behavior is reflective of anisotropic transport in layered superconductors, as evidenced in Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} as well [2].

From the onset and offset data of the superconducting transition in the presence of magnetic fields (Fig. 3), in the inset of Fig. 4 we plot the upper critical field (H_{c2}) and the irreversibility field (H_{int}) as a function of temperature. The standard criterion used for these estimations is described elsewhere [18]. Further, in a weak coupling case, the Pauli limited upper critical field is given by H_{P}(0)=1.84T_{c}=5.15 T. Under the generalized Ginzburg-Landau model, H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)([1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2})], where t=T/T_{c}. In the main panel of Fig. 4, fitting of our data to this equation gives H_{c2}\parallel ab(0)=2.1\pm 0.025 T (red line) and H_{c2}\parallel c(0)=1.4\pm 0.035 T (blue line). In conventional single band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory, [19] the orbital limited upper critical field of the type- II superconductor in the clean limit is described by H_{c2}=-0.72T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}} and is estimated to be 1.6 T for H\parallel ab. Since H_{c0}^{\text{orb}}(0)<H_{c2}(0)<H_{P}(0), the superconductivity in Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is Pauli limited. With a Maki parameter \alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}(0)/H_{P}(0) of less than 1, the Flude-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is reflective of the spatially modulated order parameter, is not indicated [20]. The electronic anisotropy parameter \Gamma\equiv H_{c2,ab}/H_{c2,c}=\lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab} is about 1.5, and using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau formulas [21]H_{c2,ab}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}) and H_{c2,c}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2}), with \Phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-7} G m^{2}, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence lengths are estimated as \xi_{ab}=15.3\pm 0.1 nm and \xi_{c}=10.2\pm 0.1 nm. The GL parameters along the two field directions are defined as \kappa_{ab}=\sqrt{\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c}/\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}} and \kappa_{c}=\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab}[22, 23, 24]. Using H_{c1,ab}=(\Phi_{0}/4T\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c})(\ln\kappa_{ab}+0.5)[25] and GL formulas, H_{c2,ab}/H_{c1,ab}=X_{c2}/(\ln\kappa_{ab}+0.5) gives \kappa_{ab}=119.2\pm 2.6. Further, from the H_{c1,ab} formula and \lambda_{c}=\Gamma\lambda_{ab} we get \lambda_{ab}(0)=1221\pm 36 nm.

  surprising to see superconductivity at 2.9 K with such a low carrier concentration, and most likely a non-BCS mechanism is at play, as is the case in Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3}[26]. The normal state magnetoresistance (not shown) was found to be nonlinear for fields up to 12 T.

The low temperature Hall measurement in combination with temperature-dependent thermoelectric power (TEP) data can be used to estimate the effective mass of carriers m^{*} and the Sommerfeld constant \gamma[18]. Using a simplistic free electron model and with an electron carrier concentration n=1.58\times 10^{25} m^{-3} at 50 K, the Fermi energy (temperature) comes out to be 23 meV (266.8 K). In low carrier concentration metals, the Seebeck coefficient is given by the Mott expression S=\pi^{2}k_{B}T/(2eT_{F}), where T_{F} is the Fermi temperature [27, 28]. Using T_{F}=266.8 K in this expression yields a Seebeck coefficient of -80\muV K^{-1} at 50 K, which is larger than the measured value of -19\muV K^{-1}. This implies an effective mass of electron m^{*}=0.24m_{e} and a corresponding value of the Sommerfeld constant \gamma equal to 4.0 J/m^{3} K^{2}. The value of m^{*} is 1.85 times higher than its value in the parent Bi_{2}Se_{3}, as calculated from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) measurements [29, 30]. We note that the mean free path for charge carriers is given by the relation l=hk_{F}/2\pi\rho_{0}ne^{2}[2, 26]. Taking \rho_{0}=0.368\times 10^{-5}\Omega m and n=1.85\times 10^{25} m^{-3} at 10 K, and assuming a spherical Fermi surface with a wave vector k_{F}=(3\pi^{2}n)^{1/3}=8.2\times 10^{8} m^{-1}, the mean free path l is estimated to be 49.4 nm, which is greater than \xi_{ab} and \xi_{c}. This confirms that our sample is in the clean limit.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we report superconductivity in the Sr-intercalated topological insulator Bi_{2}Se_{3} with a Sr concentration in the range 0.1<x<0.2. This is achieved at a surprisingly low carrier concentration of 1.85\times 10^{19} cm^{-3}. An about 93% superconducting shielding fraction is obtained for x=0.1 with onset resistive T_{c}=2.94 K. The anisotropy in the upper critical field of Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} yields \Gamma=1.5 with an upper critical field H_{c2}(0) equal to 2.1 T for a magnetic field applied parallel to the ab plane of the sample. Corresponding Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths are \xi_{ab}=15.3 nm and \xi_{c}=10.2 nm. The lower critical field H_{c1,ab}(0) and zero temperature penetration depth \lambda_{ab}(0) are 0.39 \pm 0.02 mT and 1221 \pm 36 nm, respectively. Signatures of an unconventional pairing state are indicated.

###### Abstract

Strontium intercalation between van der Waals bonded layers of the topological insulator Bi_{2}Se_{3} is found to induce superconductivity with a maximum T_{c} of 2.9 K. Transport measurement on a single crystal of the optimally doped sample Sr_{1.0}Bi_{2}Se_{3} shows weak anisotropy (\Gamma\sim 1.5) and an upper critical field H_{c2}(0) equal to 2.1 T for a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the c axis of the sample. The Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths are found to be \xi_{ab}=15.3 nm and \xi_{c}=10.2 nm. The lower critical field H_{c1,ab}(0) and zero temperature penetration depth \lambda_{ab}(0) are estimated to be 0.39\pm 0.02 mT and 1221\pm 36 nm, respectively. Hall and Seebeck measurements confirm the dominance of electronic conduction, and the carrier concentration is surprisingly low (n=1.85\times 10^{39} cm^{-3}) at 10 K, indicating the possibility of unconventional superconductivity.

Superconductors derived from topological insulating phases of quantum matter are among the most profound developments of the recent past [1, 2, 3]. Extensively studied three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), such as Bi_{2}Se_{3} and SnTe, are characterized by gapless spin polarized surface states that emerge from the peculiar topology of an insulating bulk band structure [4]. These surface states show a Dirac-like linear dispersion with the spin polarization locked perpendicular to the electron momentum [5]. Correspondingly, theoretical predictions on a superconducting analog, a fully gapped odd parity pairing state with gapless Majorana surface states, have attracted significant attention [4]. In this Rapid Communication we describe the synthesis and extensive electromagnetic characterization of one such possible example: superconductivity in Sr-intercalated Bi_{2}Se_{3}.

Pristine Bi_{2}Se_{3} is a wide band semiconductor with a layered crystal structure. It is made from double layers of BiSe_{6} octahedra (R^{3}\overline{3}m, space group 166) consisting of stacked Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers. These are weakly van der Waals bonded to the neighboring set of layers [6]. As seen in other chalcogenides [7], this layered structure leads to intercalative chemical maneuverings, and topological superconductivity (T_{c}\sim 3.5 K) has been reported in Cu-intercalated Bi_{2}Se_{3} (Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, 0.12<x<0.15) [1,2]. Further, at high pressure, Bi_{2}Te_{3}, Bi_{2}Se_{3}, and Sb_{2}Te_{3} are reported to be superconducting [8, 9, 10]. A recent study on In-doped SnTe has also shown superconductivity with a T_{c} of \sim4.5 K [11, 12]. Very recently, intercalation of Sr in Bi_{2}Se_{3} was reported with T_{c}\sim 2.5 K, with a large shielding fraction of 88% [13]. In this Rapid Communication we report a successful synthesis of single crystals of Sr-intercalated Sr_{3}Bi_{2}Se_{3} with an optimal T_{c} of 2.9 K for x=0.1.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} for x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20 were prepared by melting stoichiometric amounts of high purity elements of Bi (99.999%), Se (99.999%), and Sr (99%) at 850 degC in sealed evacuated quartz tubes for 8 days, followed by slow cooling to 650 degC at a rate of 10 degC/h. The sample was then quenched in ice water. The obtained crystals were silvery and shiny with a mircrilike surface and were easily cleaved along the basal plane of the crystal. The samples remained silvery and shiny even after exposure to air for a long time, unlike Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, where the sample surface turned golden brown after 1 day exposure to air [2]. The dimensions of the cleaved Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} crystals were approximately 3\times 2\times 0.5 mm^{3}. The samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction at room temperature using a Rigaku powder x-ray diffractometer (Miniflex-600 with CuKa radiation). Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained from a Bruker AXS microanalyzer and from a Zeiss EVO40 SEM analyzer, respectively. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurement was done using a JEOL (JEM-2100F) transmission electron microscope. Resistivity, Hall, and magnetization measurements were carried out using a 14 T _Cryogenics_ physical property measurement system (PPMS). The Seebeck coefficient was measured from room temperature down to 50 K using a home-built setup. As discussed below, in transport and magnetization measurements, it was confirmed that x=0.1 is the optimal sample with a large superconducting shielding fraction, and in this Rapid Communication we emphasize on this composition.

## III Result and Discussion

Figure (a) shows the x-ray diffraction (XRD) data along the basal plane reflections from Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. The sharp peaks along (00\prime) confirm single crystalline growth of the sample. All the samples were subjected to EDAX, and the pattern for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is shown in inset (i) of Fig. 1(a). A quantitative analysis of the EDAX acquired through several points on the sample surface gave the percentage of the element close to stoichiometric values. For example, for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, the average atomic percentages of Sr, Bi, and Se are found to be 1%, 38%, and 61%, respectively. All the samples show a characteristic layered morphology, as seen in inset (ii) of Fig. 1(a). The schematic unit cell of Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is also included.

XRD data of Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} samples (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) were Rietveld refined by fullprof software using reported Wyckoff positions [14]. The main panel of Fig. 1(b) shows the refined XRD patterns of Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. The Bi_{2}Se_{3} system crystallizes in a rhombohedral structure with the space group R^{3}\!m. It is understood that the Sr atom in the van der Waals gap goes to octahedrally coordinated 3b (0.0,1/2) sites [2,7]. Two impurity phases, BiSe and SrBi_{2}Se_{4}, are also present in the samples, and their concentration grows with an increase in Sr percentage. These impurity phases have been taken into account for better refinement. The percentage compositions of each phase in the optimally doped sample with x=0.1 are Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} = 90.97%, BiSe = 7.05%, and SrBi_{2}Se_{4} = 1.98%. The refined lattice constants of Bi_{2}Se_{3}, a=4.14 A and c=28.64 A, are in agreement with reported data [13,15]. Evidently, the c axis increases after Sr intercalation with a=4.14 A and c=28.65 A for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}[13]. The overall volume of the unit cell was found to increase from 425.22 to 425.38, 425.40, 426.20, and 426.55 A^{3} for x=0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2, respectively. This confirms successful intercalation of Sr into Bi_{2}Se_{3} for 0.05<x<0.2.

The superlattice pattern in the electron diffraction measurements is a strong indicator of intercalation [16]. Inset (iii) in Fig. 1(b) shows the diffraction pattern for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, which demonstrates a diffused, azimuthal spread of the superlattice satellite spots associated with each Bi_{2}Se_{3} Bragg spot. The diffuse nature of the spots suggests a lower intercalant concentration, and the azimuthal spread is due to the large atomic radii of Sr [16]. Insets (iv) and (v) show the HRTEM images for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} along the (009) and (006) planes, respectively. The HRTEM shows no sign of stacking faults, intergrowths, or amorphous regions. The d values measured from the fringes for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} corresponding to the (009) and (006) planes are 3.18 and 4.78 A, respectively. In inset (v) the width of the dark lines corresponds to the distance between the quintuple layers. Moreover, there is a small and broad gap between the fringes that appears alternatively. The broader gap corresponds to the spacing between two quintuple layers (QLs), as shown in schematic for the (006) plane [Fig. 1(b)(v)]. The measured spacing of 2.23 A from the HRTEM image corroborates well with the XRD result.

The dc magnetization measured for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} with H\parallel ab under zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) protocols using a 5 G magnetic field is shown in inset (a) of Fig. 2. The onset of the diamagnetic signal is marked at 2.67 K. The superconducting shielding fraction is about 93%, as measured from ZFC data. The magnetization data taken in the FC measurement do not show significant flux trapping, implying the absence of effective pinning centers in the single crystals. Inset (b) of Fig. 2 shows the same measurement for the x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} samples. All the samples within the composition range 0.1<x<0.2 showed superconductivity with a maximum of 2.75 K for x=0.2, but the superconducting shielding fraction decreased with an increase in the Sr concentration. The M-H loop with H\parallel ab at 1.65 K shown in the main panel of Fig. 2 reflects type-II superconductivity with an identifiable irreversibility and upper critical fields. Inset (d) in Fig. 2 shows the M-H scan in a smaller field range at different temperatures towards measuring the lower critical field, which is marked by a deviation from

In inset (a) the dc susceptibilities measured with the H\parallel ab plane under ZFC (red) and FC (blue) conditions are plotted for the 5 G field. Inset (b) shows the dc magnetization graphs under ZFC for x=0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 Sr-intercalated Bi_{2}Se_{3} samples. Inset (c) shows the lower critical field H_{c1} data points (black) and the parabolic fitting (red) line. Inset (d) shows the M-H scan in the low field range at T=1.69, 1.9, 1.97, 2.0, 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 K.

The schematic unit cell is also included. The main panel of (b) shows refined XRD patterns for Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. The Bragg position for impurity phases SrBi_{2}Se_{4} and BiSe are marked.

  linearity in the diamagnetic state. Using this criterion, a set of H^{\prime}_{c}(T) with H\parallel ab was estimated and fitted to the parabolic T dependence H^{\prime}_{c1}(T)=H^{\prime}_{c1}(0)(1-(T/T_{c})^{2}], and the experimental lower critical field H^{\prime}_{c1,ab}(0) is estimated to be 0.35\pm 0.01 mT. This is shown in inset (c) of Fig. 2. Although the demagnetization effect is small for H\parallel ab, the corrected value of the lower critical field H_{c1} after demagnetization correction was calculated from H^{\prime}_{c1}(0) by using Brandt's formula H_{c1}(0)=H^{\prime}_{c1}(0)/\tanh\sqrt{0.36b/a} for approximate slab geometry [17]. For the aspect ratio b/a=3/0.5, H_{c1\parallel ab}(0) comes out to be 0.39\pm 0.02 mT, which is used for further quantitative analysis.

In Fig. 3 we summarize the magnetotransport measurements. The inset in Fig. 3(a) shows the resistivity from low temperature to room temperature of Sr_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3}. For Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3}, we find a T_{c-\text{onset}}=2.94 K and T_{c-\text{zero}}=2.8 K. This is higher by \sim0.35 K as compared to a previous report [13]. A further increase in Sr concentration does not significantly affect the resistive T_{c}, but the impurity concentration goes up. The resistivity of Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is linear in the entire temperature range with a residual resistivity \rho_{0}=0.368\times 10^{-3} G m. A sharp superconducting transition with a transition width \Delta T_{c}=T_{c-\text{onset}}-T_{c-\text{zero}}=0.16 K [inset of Fig. 3(b)] and residual resistivity ratio (\rho_{300\text{ K}}/\rho_{3\text{ K}}=1.95) are observed. As shown in the main panel of Fig. 3, with the application of an external magnetic field, a larger shift in the superconducting transition is observed for the H\parallel c axis than for the H\parallel ab plane. This behavior is reflective of anisotropic transport in layered superconductors, as evidenced in Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} as well [2].

From the onset and offset data of the superconducting transition in the presence of magnetic fields (Fig. 3), in the inset of Fig. 4 we plot the upper critical field (H_{c2}) and the irreversibility field (H_{int}) as a function of temperature. The standard criterion used for these estimations is described elsewhere [18]. Further, in a weak coupling case, the Pauli limited upper critical field is given by H_{P}(0)=1.84T_{c}=5.15 T. Under the generalized Ginzburg-Landau model, H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)([1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2})], where t=T/T_{c}. In the main panel of Fig. 4, fitting of our data to this equation gives H_{c2}\parallel ab(0)=2.1\pm 0.025 T (red line) and H_{c2}\parallel c(0)=1.4\pm 0.035 T (blue line). In conventional single band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory, [19] the orbital limited upper critical field of the type- II superconductor in the clean limit is described by H_{c2}=-0.72T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}} and is estimated to be 1.6 T for H\parallel ab. Since H_{c0}^{\text{orb}}(0)<H_{c2}(0)<H_{P}(0), the superconductivity in Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is Pauli limited. With a Maki parameter \alpha=\sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{\text{orb}}(0)/H_{P}(0) of less than 1, the Flude-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is reflective of the spatially modulated order parameter, is not indicated [20]. The electronic anisotropy parameter \Gamma\equiv H_{c2,ab}/H_{c2,c}=\lambda_{c}/\lambda_{ab} is about 1.5, and using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau formulas [21]H_{c2,ab}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}) and H_{c2,c}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2}), with \Phi_{0}=2.07\times 10^{-7} G m^{2}, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence lengths are estimated as \xi_{ab}=15.3\pm 0.1 nm and \xi_{c}=10.2\pm 0.1 nm. The GL parameters along the two field directions are defined as \kappa_{ab}=\sqrt{\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c}/\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}} and \kappa_{c}=\lambda_{ab}/\xi_{ab}[22, 23, 24]. Using H_{c1,ab}=(\Phi_{0}/4T\lambda_{ab}\lambda_{c})(\ln\kappa_{ab}+0.5)[25] and GL formulas, H_{c2,ab}/H_{c1,ab}=X_{c2}/(\ln\kappa_{ab}+0.5) gives \kappa_{ab}=119.2\pm 2.6. Further, from the H_{c1,ab} formula and \lambda_{c}=\Gamma\lambda_{ab} we get \lambda_{ab}(0)=1221\pm 36 nm.

  surprising to see superconductivity at 2.9 K with such a low carrier concentration, and most likely a non-BCS mechanism is at play, as is the case in Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3}[26]. The normal state magnetoresistance (not shown) was found to be nonlinear for fields up to 12 T.

The low temperature Hall measurement in combination with temperature-dependent thermoelectric power (TEP) data can be used to estimate the effective mass of carriers m^{*} and the Sommerfeld constant \gamma[18]. Using a simplistic free electron model and with an electron carrier concentration n=1.58\times 10^{25} m^{-3} at 50 K, the Fermi energy (temperature) comes out to be 23 meV (266.8 K). In low carrier concentration metals, the Seebeck coefficient is given by the Mott expression S=\pi^{2}k_{B}T/(2eT_{F}), where T_{F} is the Fermi temperature [27, 28]. Using T_{F}=266.8 K in this expression yields a Seebeck coefficient of -80\muV K^{-1} at 50 K, which is larger than the measured value of -19\muV K^{-1}. This implies an effective mass of electron m^{*}=0.24m_{e} and a corresponding value of the Sommerfeld constant \gamma equal to 4.0 J/m^{3} K^{2}. The value of m^{*} is 1.85 times higher than its value in the parent Bi_{2}Se_{3}, as calculated from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) measurements [29, 30]. We note that the mean free path for charge carriers is given by the relation l=hk_{F}/2\pi\rho_{0}ne^{2}[2, 26]. Taking \rho_{0}=0.368\times 10^{-5}\Omega m and n=1.85\times 10^{25} m^{-3} at 10 K, and assuming a spherical Fermi surface with a wave vector k_{F}=(3\pi^{2}n)^{1/3}=8.2\times 10^{8} m^{-1}, the mean free path l is estimated to be 49.4 nm, which is greater than \xi_{ab} and \xi_{c}. This confirms that our sample is in the clean limit.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we report superconductivity in the Sr-intercalated topological insulator Bi_{2}Se_{3} with a Sr concentration in the range 0.1<x<0.2. This is achieved at a surprisingly low carrier concentration of 1.85\times 10^{19} cm^{-3}. An about 93% superconducting shielding fraction is obtained for x=0.1 with onset resistive T_{c}=2.94 K. The anisotropy in the upper critical field of Sr_{0.1}Bi_{2}Se_{3} yields \Gamma=1.5 with an upper critical field H_{c2}(0) equal to 2.1 T for a magnetic field applied parallel to the ab plane of the sample. Corresponding Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths are \xi_{ab}=15.3 nm and \xi_{c}=10.2 nm. The lower critical field H_{c1,ab}(0) and zero temperature penetration depth \lambda_{ab}(0) are 0.39 \pm 0.02 mT and 1221 \pm 36 nm, respectively. Signatures of an unconventional pairing state are indicated.
