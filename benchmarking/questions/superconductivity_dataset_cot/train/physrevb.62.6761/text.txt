###### Abstract

Muon-spin relaxation (\(\mu\)SR) measurements were carried out in the partially Zn-substituted Y-123 system, YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-2}\),Zn\({}_{2y}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\), to investigate the so-called 1/8 effect. The muon-spin depolarization rate has been found to be anomalously enhanced at low temperatures in the Zn-substituted samples around the hole concentration per Cu in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane \(p\) ~ 1/8, as observed in the case of the Zn-substituted Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)(Cu\({}_{1-y}\)Zn\({}_{y}\))\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) with \(p\) ~ 1/8. This indicates slowing down of the Cu-spin fluctuations at \(p\) ~ 1/8. It appears that a small amount of Zn ions are effective for the enhancement of the magnetic correlation between Cu spins at \(p\) ~ 1/8. It has been concluded that the 1/8 effect exists in the Y-123 system and is common to all high-\(T_{\rm c}\) cuprates.

## I Introduction

The so-called 1/8 problem, namely, the anomalous suppression of superconductivity at \(p\) (the hole concentration per Cu in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane) ~ 1/8 in the La-214 system of high-\(T_{\rm c}\) cuprates is a long-standing one.[1, 2] However, the stripe model proposed by Tranquada _et al.[3]_ is a plausible one, which can explain the 1/8 effect. It has been proposed that the static order of spins and/or holes observed in the La-214 system with \(p\) ~ 1/8 from the elastic neutron-scattering experiments[3, 4, 5] is due to pinning of the dynamical stripe correlations of spins and holes, which are guessed to exist from the observation of incommensurate peaks near \(k\) = (_p_, _p_) in the inelastic neutron-scattering experiments.[6, 7, 8, 9] That is, the suppression of superconductivity has been interpreted as being due to the static stabilization of the dynamical stripe correlations. In the La-214 system, the tetragonal low-temperature structure (space group \(P\)42 /_n_ \(c\) _m_) is regarded as the pinning centers. A small amount of Zn ions substituted for Cu are also regarded as the pinning centers.[10, 11, 12]

Supposing the dynamical stripe correlations are characteristic of the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane, the 1/8 effect seems not to be peculiar to the La-214 system but common to all high-\(T_{\rm c}\) cuprates with the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane when adequate pinning centers are introduced into a sample. In fact, the incommensurate peaks around \(k\) = (_p_, _p_), which are associated with those of the La-214 system, have been observed in the inelastic neutron-scattering measurements of the Bi-2212 and Y-123 systems also.[13, 14, 15, 16] Moreover, in Zn-substituted (_y_ = 0.025) Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)(Cu\({}_{1-y}\)Zn\({}_{y}\))\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\), we have found the 1/8 effect, namely, the anomalous suppression of superconductivity at \(p\) ~ 1/8 (Ref. [17]) and also found anomalous slowing down of the Cu-spin fluctuations at \(p\) ~ 1/8 from the muon-spin-relaxation (_m_*SR) measurements.[18, 19, 20, 21] According to the stripe model, these experimental results have been interpreted as being due to the pinning effect of substituted Zn ions on the dynamical stripe correlations, though the dynamical correlations have not been pinned so completely as to be statically stabilized.

As for the Y-123 system of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\), it is well known that the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{\rm c}\) exhibits the so-called 60-K plateau in the \(T_{\rm c}\) vs oxygen content 7-\(\delta\) plot.[22, 23, 24, 25] The 60-K plateau of \(T_{\rm c}\) was explained as being due to ordering of oxygen vacancies in the CuO\({}_{1-\delta}\) chain.[26, 25] That is to say, it was understood that oxygen vacancies in the CuO\({}_{1-\delta}\) chain were in order for samples around 7-\(\delta\)=6.6 and that the ordering made the samples more conductive and enhanced \(T_{\rm c}\), leading to the appearance of the plateau of \(T_{\rm c}\) around 7-\(\delta\)= 6.6. However, Tallon _et al.[27]_ have pointed out from the thermoelectric power, NMR, and specific heat measurements that the 60-K plateau is related to the 1/8 effect. Moreover, we have found from the transport measurements of Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{3}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (_x_ = 0 and 0.2) that the 60-K plateau is not correlated with 7-\(\delta\) but is correlated with \(p\) and proposed that the 60-K plateau is interpreted as being due to the suppression of superconductivity at \(p\) ~ 1/8, namely, the 1/8 effect rather than the ordering of oxygen vacancies in the CuO\({}_{1-\delta}\) chain.[28] A similar result has also been reported by Tallon _et al.[29]_

In this paper, we have carried out the zero-field (ZF)  \(\mu\)SR measurements in the partially Zn-substituted (_y_ = 0.025) and non-Zn-substituted (_y_ = 0) samples of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-_{2}}\)Zn\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) with various values of 7 - \(\delta\), in order to investigate the Cu-spin state around \(p\) = 1/8 and confirm the existence of the 1/8 effect in the Y-123 system. Here, Zn is introduced into a sample to pin the possible dynamical stripe correlations of spins and holes. As Zn is known to be mainly substituted for Cu in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane, \(y\) in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-_{2}}\)Zn\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) is regarded as the Zn concentration in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane.[30]

## II II. Experiment

Sintered samples of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-_{2}}\)Zn\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) with \(y\) = 0 and 0.025 were prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction method. Raw materials of Y\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), BaCO\({}_{3}\), CuO, and ZnO powders were mixed and prefired at 900 degC for 12 h in air. The prefired materials were mixed, pelletized, and sintered in air at 930 degC for 24 h, following by furnace cooling. This sintering process was repeated. Post-annealing was performed in O\({}_{2}\) at 500 degC for 24 h. In this stage, fully oxidized samples with small values of \(\delta\) were prepared. The oxygen content was changed by subsequent annealing and quenching. That is, the fully oxidized samples were again heated in air at 900 degC for 12 h and cooled down to a temperature _Tq_ , at a rate of 200 degC/h and kept at _Tq_ for 12 h, following by quenching into liquid nitrogen. All products were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction to be of the single phase. The oxygen content was determined by iodometric titration. The \(p\) value was estimated from the value of the thermorelectric power at 290 K, \(S\)290 K, using the universal relation between \(p\) in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane and \(S\)290 K, which is empirically known to hold good in most of the high-_T_c cuprates including the Y-123 phase.[27, 28, 31] The electrical resistivity was measured by the dc four-point probe method to determine _T_c.

ZF-\(\mu\)SR measurements were carried out at Muon Science Laboratory, Institute of Materials Structure Science, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK-MSL) in Japan. A spin-polarized pulsed surface-muon beam with a momentum of 27 MeV/_c_ was used. A \({}^{4}\)He gas-flow-type cryostat was used for the measurements at temperatures above 2 K. The asymmetry parameter is defined as _A_(_t_) = [_F_(_t_) - _aB_(_t_)]/[_F_(_t_) + _aB_(_t_)], where _F_(_t_) and _B_(_t_) are muon events counted by forward and backward counters at a time \(t\), respectively. \(a\) is a calibration factor reflecting the relative counting efficiencies of the forward and backward counters.

## III III. Results and Discussion

Figure 1 displays typical ZF-\(\mu\)SR time spectra of the non-Zn-substituted (_y_ = 0) and Zn-substituted (_y_ = 0.025) samples of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-_{2}}\)Zn\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) with 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.75 (_p_ > 1/8), 6.65 - 6.67 (_p_ \(\sim\) 1/8), and 6.41 - 6.56 (_p_ < 1/8) at various temperatures. The time spectra at high temperatures are of the Gaussian type for every sample. This means that muon spins are depolarized mainly by randomly distributed nuclear dipole fields. For 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.75 (_p_ > 1/8), it is found that the time spectrum does not change even at low temperatures in both of the non-Zn-substituted and Zn-substituted samples. For 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.65 - 6.67 (_p_ \(\sim\) 1/8), on the other hand, it is found that the time spectrum of the Zn-substituted sample changes from the Gaussian type to the exponential type with decreasing temperature at low temperatures below ~5 K, while the time spectrum of the non-Zn-substituted sample does not change even at low temperatures. This is similar to the case of the Zn-substituted samples of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)(Cu\({}_{1-x}\)Zn\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) with \(p\) \(\sim\) 1/8,[18, 19, 20, 21] and suggests that the Cu-spin fluctuations slow down at low temperatures also in the Zn-substituted sample of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-_{2}}\)Zn\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) with \(p\) \(\sim\) 1/8. For 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.41 - 6.47 (_p_ \(<\) 1/8), it is found that the time spectrum changes to the exponential type at low temperatures in both of the non-Zn-substituted and Zn-substituted samples. This is interpreted as being due to static or nearly static Cu spins in the so-called spin-glass-like phase, which appears at low temperatures in the strongly underdoped region, as formerly reported in the Y-123 system.[32, 33] Similar results have also been obtained at \(p\) \(<\) 1/8 in the Bi-2212 system.[20, 21] What is remarkable in Fig. 1 is that the time spectrum of the Zn-substituted sample with 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.56 at 2 K is not so exponential as that of the Zn-substituted sample with 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.65 (_p_ \(\sim\) 1/8) at 2 K.

  This suggests that the Cu-spin fluctuations exhibit slowing-down behavior singularly at \(p\) ~ 1/8 in the Zn-substituted samples.

The Gaussian-type behavior of the time spectrum is fitted using a single-component function \(A_{1}e^{-\lambda_{1}t}G_{z}(\Delta,t)\), where \(A_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{1}\) are the initial asymmetry at \(t\) = 0 and the depolarization rate of muon spins, respectively. \(G_{z}(\Delta,t)\) is the static Kubo-Toyabe function with a field-distribution width of \(\Delta/\gamma_{\mu}\) at the muon sites, where \(\gamma_{\mu}\) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon spin (2 \(\pi\) x 13.554 MHz/kG). As for the exponential-type behavior of the time spectrum, the time spectrum of the Zn-substituted sample with 7 - 6 = 6.65 at 2 K cannot be analyzed using a simple exponential function. Therefore, a two-exponential-component function, \(A_{1}e^{-\lambda_{1}t}\) + \(A_{2}e^{-\lambda_{2}t}\), is used for the analysis. Here, \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{2}\) are initial asymmetries at \(t\) = 0 and \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) are depolarization rates of the fast- and slow-depolarization components, respectively. This analysis means that two kinds of muon sites are taken into account.

It is known that muons injected into a sample of a high-_T_c cuprate sit adjacent to oxygen ions.[34] From the previous _m_SR studies, there are expected to be roughly two kinds of muon sites in the Y-123 system; one is adjacent to the in-plane and apical oxygen ions surrounding Cu in the CuO2 plane, and the other is adjacent to the oxygen ions in the CuO1-_d_ chain.[35, 36] Muons sitting adjacent to the in-plane and apical oxygen ions feel strong internal fields from the Cu spins in the CuO2 plane, and muons sitting adjacent to the oxygen ions in the CuO1-_d_ chain that are far away from the Cu spins in the CuO2 plane feel weaker internal fields, because the internal fields at the muon sites are dominated by the rapidly decaying dipolar fields of the Cu spins in the CuO2 plane. Because of this difference in the internal field, the depolarization of the muon spins near the in-plane and apical oxygen ions surrounding Cu in the CuO2 plane is expected to be faster than that of the muon spins near the oxygen ions in the CuO1-_d_ chain. Accordingly, the ratio of \(A_{1}\):\(A_{2}\) is taken as \(6/(7-\delta)\):\((1-\delta)/(7-\delta)\) on the assumption that a muon sits adjacent to each oxygen ion equally. Solid lines in Fig. 1 show the best fit results. It appears that the two-component analysis is reasonable.[36] This kind of two-component analysis also proved successful in the previous _m_SR study on the Zn-substituted Bi-2212 system.[18, 19, 20, 21]

Figure 2 shows the dependences on the oxygen content 7 - \(\delta\) of _T_c and the muon-spin depolarization rate \(\lambda_{1}\) at 2 and 3 K. _T_c is defined as the midpoint of the superconducting transition curve in the resistivity vs \(T\) plot. It is clearly found that the depolarization rate shows a local maximum around 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.65, namely, \(p\) ~ 1/8, in the Zn-substituted samples with \(y\) = 0.025. This local maximum indicates drastic slowing down of the Cu-spin fluctuations in the Zn-substituted samples with \(p\) ~ 1/8. This is the same anomaly as observed at \(p\) ~ 1/8 in the Zn-substituted samples of Bi2Sr2Ca1-_T_x(Cu1-_T_Zn_)2O8+ \(\delta\) with \(y\) = 0.025.[19, 20, 21] The local maximum of \(\lambda_{1}\) at \(p\) ~ 1/8 is roughly in correspondence to the local suppression of superconductivity, as seen in Fig. 2. In the non-Zn-substituted samples, no enhancement of \(\lambda_{1}\) is observed at \(p\) ~ 1/8. Therefore, it is found that both Zn-substitution and \(p\) ~ 1/8 are essential for the slowing down of the Cu-spin fluctuations. These results are analogous to the 1/8 effect in the La-214 system and very similar to the 1/8 effect in the Bi-2212 system. Therefore, it is concluded that the same 1/8 effect exists in the Y-123 system as well.

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the muon-spin depolarization rate \(\lambda_{1}\) of all of the measured samples. The depolarization rate of the non-Zn-substituted samples with 7 - \(\delta\) \(\approx\) 6.56 shows a very weak temperature dependence above 2 K. The Zn-substituted samples with 7 - \(\delta\) \(\approx\) 6.73 also shows a similar weak temperature dependence. These results indicate that the static and dynamical properties of Cu spins do not change in the case of 7 - \(\delta\) \(\approx\) 6.73, even in the Zn-substituted samples. The depolarization rates of the non-Zn-substituted sample with 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.41 and the Zn-substituted sample with 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.47 in the strongly underdoped region increase with decreasing temperature at low temperatures below 3-5 K, which is due to static or nearly static Cu-spins in the spin-glass-like phase, as mentioned before. It is found that the depolarization rate of the Zn-substituted sample with 7 - \(\delta\) = 6.65 (_p_ ~ 1/8) increases with decreasing temperature at low temperatures below 3-5 K. In the Zn-substituted Bi2Sr2Ca1-_T_x(Cu1-_T_Zn_)2O8+ \(\delta\) with \(y\) = 0.025 and \(p\) ~ 1/8, the similar increase of the depolarization rate with decreasing temperature was observed below about 10 K.[19]

Previously, we have suggested the existence of the 1/8 effect in the non-Zn-substituted Y-123 system.[28] So, the muon-spin depolarization was expected to be enhanced also in the non-Zn-substituted sample with \(p\) ~ 1/8, but no anomaly has been observed for the sample by the present _m_SR measurements. The time window of _m_SR is typically 10\({}^{-6}\) - 10\({}^{-11}\) sec. That is to say, when the characteristic time of the Cu-spin fluctuations is much longer than ~ 10\({}^{-6}\) sec, muons feel almost static fields of the Cu spins in their lifetime. When the time is much shorter than ~ 10\({}^{-11}\) sec, on the

Lines are guides to the eye.

  other hand, muons feel almost zero averaged field due to the Cu spins, leading to no depolarization due to the Cu spins. Considering that the superconductivity is suppressed in the non-Zn-substituted samples with \(p\) ~ 1/8, the Cu-spin fluctuations are expected to slow down to some extent. Therefore, we suppose that the slowing down has not been detected by the _m_SR measurements because their characteristic time remains shorter than \(\sim 10^{- 11}\) sec.

Accordingly, it appears that a small amount of Zn ions are effective for the enhancement of the magnetic correlation between Cu spins at \(p\) ~ 1/8 as in the case of the Bi-2212 system.[17-21] On the other hand, we suppose that a large amount of Zn ions destroy the magnetic correlation between Cu spins and hence the Cu-spin fluctuations remain fast. In the former _m_SR measurements on the heavily Zn-substituted samples of the Y-123 system, in fact, no slowing down behavior at \(p\) ~ 1/8 was reported.[33] These results are consistent with the stripe model. That is, a small amount of Zn ions are regarded as operating to pin the dynamical stripe correlations, leading to the slowing down of the Cu-spin fluctuations.

In the Zn-substituted Y-123 system with \(p\) ~ 1/8, three-dimensional long-range ordering of the Cu spins, as observed in the La-214 system,[37] has not been observed at temperatures above 2 K. The same was found for the Zn-substituted Bi-2212 system with \(p\) ~ 1/8.[18-21] This may mean that a coherent long-range-ordered state of the Cu spins is hard to be stabilized in the Zn-substituted Y-123 and Bi-2212 systems, because the pinning force of one Zn ion is much more short-range and weaker than that of the tetragonal low-temperature structure in the La-214 system or because Zn ions pinning the stripes within a plane are not correlated from plane to plane so that there is no correlation of the stripes plane to plane. In order to study the state of the Cu spins in detail, further _m_SR measurements in longitudinal magnetic fields at lower temperatures will be necessary.

## IV Summary

_m_SR measurements were carried out in the partially Zn-substituted (_y_ = 0.025) and non-Zn-substituted (_y_ = 0) samples of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3- 2}\),Zn\({}_{2}\),O\({}_{7- \delta}\). Anomalous enhancement of the muon-spin depolarization rate has been found at low temperatures in the Zn-substituted samples with \(p\) ~ 1/8, as previously observed in Zn-substituted samples of Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Ca\({}_{1- x}\)Y\({}_{x}\)(Cu\({}_{1- y}\)Zn\({}_{y}\))\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\) with \(y\) = 0.025 and \(p\) ~ 1/8. This indicates that the Cu-spin fluctuations slow down into the _m_SR time window at low temperatures. It appears that a small amount of Zn ions are effective for the enhancement of the magnetic correlation between Cu spins at \(p\) ~ 1/8. On the analogy with the 1/8 effect in the La-214 and Bi-2212 systems, there is a possibility that a kind of dynamical order of holes and/or spins, such as the so-called stripe order, exists also in the Y-123 system and that it tends to be pinned by Zn at \(p\) ~ 1/8, leading to the anomalous enhancement of the muon-spin depolarization rate and the suppression of superconductivity at \(p\) ~ 1/8. It is concluded that the 1/8 effect probably exists in the Y-123 system and is common to all high-_T_c cuprates.

To be more conclusive, further experiments, such as direct observation of the possible order of spins and/or holes by means of electron diffraction and neutron diffraction, are necessary in the Zn-substituted YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3- 2}\),Zn\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7- \delta}\) with \(p\) ~ 1/8.

* [36] Strictly speaking, the depolarization rate of the muons near the apical oxygen ions is different from that of the muons near the in-plane oxygen ions. Moerover, there may be a difference of the depolarization rate even in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane on account of the stripe structure. However, it seems meaningless to make the three- or four-component analysis, because the present experimental data are not so accurate as to be fitted using many parameters.
