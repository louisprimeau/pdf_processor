24 September that Ta_{2}S_{2}C sample consists of a 3R phase as a majority phase and a 1T phase as a minority phase.[6] The sample characterization was carried out by scanning tunneling microscopy[9] and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.[10] The measurements of dc and ac magnetic susceptibility were carried out using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS XL-5). A polycrystalline powdered sample (mass 253.2 mg) was used in the present work. Before setting up a sample at 298 K, a remnant magnetic field was reduced to less than 3 mOe using an ultralow field capability option. For convenience, hereafter this remnant field is noted as the state H=0. The detail of the measurements of dc and ac magnetic susceptibility is described in Sec. III.

## III Result

### \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime}

Figure 1 shows the T dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility [(a) the dispersion \chi^{\prime} and (b) the absorption \chi^{\prime}], where the ac frequency f (=1 Hz) and the magnitude of the ac field (h=0.5 Oe) are used. The T dependence of \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime} is strongly dependent on H. The sign of \chi^{\prime} is negative at least for 1.9 < T< 5 K, while the sign of \chi^{\prime\prime} is positive. For H=0 [see the inset of Fig. 1(a)], \chi^{\prime} increases with increasing T. It shows a kink at a critical temperature T_{cl} (=3.61 K) where the derivative \mathrm{d}\chi^{\prime}/\mathrm{d}T undergoes a discontinuous jump. The system undergoes a superconducting transition at T_{cl}. The absorption \chi^{\prime\prime} at H=0 shows a drastic decrease around T_{cl} [see Fig. 2(c) for detail]. It shows a tail above T_{cl} and is reduced to zero around 5 K. The temperature at which the tangential line \chi^{\prime\prime} vs T with the steepest slope intersects the \chi^{\prime}=0 axis coincides with T_{cl}.

In Figs. 2(a)-2(c) we show the T dependence of \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime} at f=0.1 Hz and h=0.5 Oe for 0 \leq H\leq 5 kOe. The dispersion \chi^{\prime} shows a kink-like behavior at T_{cl}(H), increases with

  further increasing T and reduces to zero at T_{x}(_H_). In the plot of (-_kh_') vs T in Fig. 2(b), two steplike changes are clearly observed at T_{i}(_H_) and T_{x}(_H_). Although _kh_'' drastically decreases at T_{i}(_H_) with increasing T [see Fig. 2(c)], no drastic change in _kh_' is observed at T_{x}(_H_) in contrast to the case of -_kh_' vs T. The critical temperatures T_{i}(_H_) and T_{x}(_H_) decrease with increasing H, forming the _H_-_T_ phase diagram (see Sec. III E).

### _M-H_ loop

Figure 3(a) shows the hysteresis loop of the magnetization M at _T_=1.9 K. After the sample was quenched from 298 to 1.9 K at _H_=0, the measurement was carried out with varying H from 0 to 1 kOe at T, from _H_=1 to -1 kOe, and from _H_=-1 to 1 kOe. The _M-H_ curve at 1.9 K shows a large hysteresis and a remnant magnetization. Structural imperfections or defect in the sample may play a role of flux pinning, resulting in a inhomogeneous type-II superconductor. Figure 3(b) shows typical data of zero-field cooled (ZFC) magnetization _M_ZFC vs H at various T. Before each measurement, the sample was kept at 20 K and _H_=0 for 20 min and then it was quenched from 20 K to T (<4 K). The magnetization _M_ZFC at T was measured with increasing H (0 \leq_H_ \leq 120 Oe). The magnetization _M_ZFC exhibits a single local minimum at a characteristic field for T <T_{i}, shifting to the low-_H_ side with increasing T. The lower critical field H_{c1}^{(l)}(T) is defined not as the first minimum point of the _M_ZFC vs H, but as the first deviation point from the linear portion due to the penetration of magnetic flux into the sample: typically, H_{c1}^{(l)}(T=1.9 K) =20 Oe and H_{c1}^{(l)}(T=2.7 K) =12 Oe. The least-squares fit of the data of H_{c1}^{(l)} vs T to a conventional relation [20]H_{c1}^{(l)}(T) = H_{c1}^{(l)}(0)[1-(T/T_{c1})^{2}] yields H_{c1}^{(l)}(0) =28 \pm 2 Oe.

### _kh_ZFC and _kh_FC

The measurements of _kh_ZFC (=_M_ZFC/_H_) and _kh_FC (=_M_FC/_H_) were carried out as follows, where _M_FC is the field-cooled (FC) magnetization. After annealing at 50 K for 1200 s in the absence of H, the sample was quenched from 50 to 1.9 K. The magnetic field H was applied at 1.9 K and then _kh_ZFC was measured with increasing T. The sample was again heated up and annealed at 50 K for 1200 s in the presence of H. Then _kh_FC was measured with decreasing T. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the T dependence of _kh_ZFC, _kh_FC, and _kh_x_ at _H_=1 Oe, where _kh_x_=_kh_FC-_kh_ZFC. The scale of the susceptibility is enlarged in Fig. 4(b). The susceptibility _kh_ZFC (_kh_FC) exhibits a kink at T_{i} (=3.61 K), where \text{d}\chi_{\text{ZFC}}/\text{d}T (d\chi_{\text{ZFC}}/\text{d}T) undergoes a drastic decrease. The deviation of _kh_ZFC from _kh_FC is clearly seen below T_{i} (=3.61 K), indicating that the extra magnetic flux is trapped during the FC process. Between T_{i} and T_{x} (=8.9 K), _kh_x_ is still positive but almost equal to zero. The sign of _kh_ZFC (_kh_FC) changes from negative to positive at T_{u}. Similar behavior is also observed at H = 20 Oe as shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). Figure 5 shows the T dependence of _kh_x at various H. The value of _kh_x_ at fixed T decreases with increasing H. The difference _kh_x_ undergoes a drastic decrease at T_{i}(_H_).

The minimum value of _kh_ZFC at H = 1 Oe is -1.7 \times 10^{-3} emu/g at 1.9 K, while the minimum value of _kh_' at H = 0 is -1.8 x 10^{-3} emu/g at 1.9 K. Using the value of _kh_' at 1.9 K (=-1.8 x 10^{-3} emu/g) and the calculated density for 3R-Ta_{2}S_{2}C (_p_cal=9.23 g/cm^{3}),[1] the fraction of flux expulsion relative to complete diamagnetism (_kh_0 = -1/4 \pi= -0.0796 emu/cm^{3}) is estimated as 21%, suggesting that the system consists of small grains. This is in contrast to 38% of the diamagnetic volume fraction reported for Nb_{2}S_{2}C by Sakamaki _et al.[11]_

Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the T dependence of _kh_ZFC at various H, where the measurement was carried out between 1.9 and 11 K with increasing T. There is a drastic increase in the diamagnetic contribution in _kh_ZFC associated with the superconducting transition at T_{i}(_H_). Nevertheless, a diamagnetic contribution in _kh_ZFC still remains above T_{i}(_H_). The susceptibility _kh_ZFC increases with further increasing T, and reduces to a zero at an upper critical temperature T_{x}(_H_). For H = 500 Oe, for example, _kh_ZFC exhibits a kink at T_{i}(_H_). The sign of _kh_ZFC changes from negative to positive around 9 K with increasing T. At H = 5 kOe, _kh_ZFC is positive at least between 1.9 and 6 K, showing a broad peak at 2.65 K. At H = 10 kOe, _kh_ZFC decreases with increasing T, showing a

  Curie-type behavior. Figure 7(a) shows the T dependence of \delta\chi at various H. The magnitude of \delta\chi between T_{cl}(H) and T_{cu}(H) is very small compared to that below T_{cl}(H), but still shows the irreversible effect of magnetization. The difference \delta\chi at fixed H decreases with increasing T and reduces to zero at T_{cu}(H). Note that \delta\chi at fixed T (for example 5 K) increases with increasing H, showing a maximum around H=500 Oe, and decreases with further increasing H. This feature is in contrast to the H dependence of \delta\chi below T_{cl}(H), which decreases with increasing H. Figure 7(b) shows the T dependence of the derivative {\rm d}\chi_{\rm ZFC}/{\rm d}T for 5 Oe\congH\leq 10 kOe. Clearly {\rm d}\chi_{\rm ZFC}/{\rm d}T at low H undergoes two steplike changes around T_{cl}(H) and T_{cu}(H). The critical temperatures T_{cl}(H) and T_{cu}(H) decrease with increasing H, forming the H-T phase diagram (see Sec. III E).

### \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} in a quasiequilibrium state

Here we present our peculiar results on the T dependence of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}. The method of the measurement for \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} is slightly different from that for the conventional \chi_{\rm ZFC}. First, the sample was annealed at 50 K for 1200 s in the absence of H and then it was quenched to 1.9 K. After the sample was kept at 1.9 K for 100 s in the presence of fixed H, it was quickly heated up to T_{0} between T_{cl} and T_{cur}. Then \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} was measured with increasing T from T_{0} to 11 K. Figures 8(a)-8(d) show the T dependence of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}, \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}, and \chi_{\rm FC} at various H (5, 10, 30, and 50 Oe), where T_{0}=5 K. The T dependence of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} at the same H is independent of T_{0} when T_{0} is between 4 and 8 K. The data of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} vs T at H=1 and 20 Oe are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(d), respectively. The susceptibility \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} increases with increasing T and reduces to zero at T_{cu}(H). The magnitudes of \chi_{\rm ZFC}, \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}, and \chi_{\rm FC} at the same T are strongly dependent on H: \chi_{\rm ZFC}>\chi_{\rm FC}>\chi_{\rm ZFC} for H=1\,-30 Oe, \chi_{\rm FC}>\chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}>\chi_{\rm ZFC} for H=50 Oe, and \chi_{\rm FC}>\chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}=\chi_{\rm ZFC} for H=100 and 150 Oe (the data are not shown in Fig. 8). Note that \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} at H=1 Oe [see Fig. 4(b)], whose sign is positive, decreases with increasing T and reduces to zero at T_{cu}. Between T_{cl} and T_{cu}, the space of states is divided into at least three states, the ZFC, ZFC^{*}, and FC state. The system lies in the FC states under the cooling from 11 K, the ZFC state under the slow heating from 1.9 K, and

T dependence of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} (5\leqT\leq 10 K) is also shown for comparison. The definition of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} is given in Sec. III D.

  the ZFC^{+} state under the rapid heating from 1.9 K. The value of H (=30 Oe) is slightly higher than the lower critical field H_{c1}^{(l)}(T=1.9 K) =20 Oe. The susceptibility of each state provides a measure for the corresponding induced magnetic flux density B which is trapped in the superconducting grains: B = H + 4 \pi M. The inequality \chi_{\rm ZFC}^{+}>\chi_{\rm FC} indicates that the induced magnetic flux density (or the number of fluxoids over the system ) in the ZFC^{+} state is higher than that in the FC state for H<30 Oe. Such a relatively high flux density in the ZFC^{+} state may be due to a flux compression as a result of the rapid redistribution of the grain-pinned vortices which occurs during a change of T from 1.9 K to T_{0}. This effect exists only at low H. In this sense, the present effect is similar to the paramagnetic Meissner effect observed in \chi_{FC} of the pristine Nb:[21, 22]\chi_{\rm FC} at low H becomes positive below the superconducting transition temperature. According to Koshelev and Larkin,[23] the surface supercurrent inhomogeneously traps the magnetic flux in the sample interior, as a vortex. In Sec. IV A we discuss a possible distribution of vortices around the grains in the ZFC and FC states below T_{cl} and between T_{cl} and T_{car}.

### _H-T_ diagram

Figure 9 shows the _H-T_ phase diagram, where T_{cl}(H) is determined from the data of \chi^{\prime} vs T and \chi^{\prime\prime} vs T, and T_{car}(H) is determined from the data of \chi_{\rm ZFC} vs T. These lines correspond to the lines H_{c2}^{(l)}(T) and H_{c2}^{(h)}(T). The least squares-fit of the data of H vs T for the line H_{c2}^{(l)}(T) to a conventional relation H_{c2}^{(l)}(T)=H_{c2}^{(l)}(0)([1 - (T/T_{cl})^{2}] yields H_{c2}^{(l)}(0)= 7.7 \pm 0.2 KOe and T_{cl}=3.61 \pm 0.01 K, where the data of \chi^{\prime} vs \

 obtained from the linear relation in H_{c2}^{(l)} vs T in the vicinity of T=T_{cl} and H_{c2}^{(l)}=0.

The coherence length \xi and the magnetic penetration depth \lambda are related to H_{c1}^{(l)}(0) and H_{c2}^{(l)}(0) through relations H_{c1}^{(l)}(0)=\Phi_{0}f(2\pi\xi^{2}) and H_{c1}^{(l)}(0)=(\Phi_{0}/4\,\pi\lambda^{2})ln(\  T_{c} of the pristine TaC_{1-x} increases with decreasing x and is equal to 9.0 K at x=0.019. Fink _et al._[13] have reported that the values of H_{c1} and H_{c2} at T=1.2 K for TaC are 220 Oe and 4.6 kOe. These values are on the same order as the values of T_{cw} and H_{c2}^{(w)}(0) in Ta_{2}S_{2}C. The origin of the superconductivity at T_{c\rm{f}} and T_{cw} will be discussed in Sec. IV.1.

### \chi_{\rm{ZFC}} and \chi_{\rm{FC}} at high H and high T

In Fig. 10 we show the T dependence of \chi_{\rm{FC}} at various H. The susceptibility \chi_{\rm{FC}} (also \chi_{\rm{ZFC}}) at H=20 Oe shows a sharp peak around 9.5 K and decreases with further increasing T. The sign of \chi_{\rm{FC}} changes from positive to negative around 16 K. The discontinuous jump of \chi observed in the vicinity of \chi=0 is an artifact due to the SQUID measurement. In contrast, \chi_{\rm{FC}} (=\chi_{\rm{ZFC}}) at H=10 kOe decreases with increasing T from 1.9 K and merges to the curves of \chi_{\rm{FC}} at H=20 Oe above 9.5 K.

Figure 11 shows the T dependence of \chi_{\rm{FC}} at H=10 kOe for 1.9\,\leqslant\,T\,\leqslant\,298 K. The susceptibility \chi consists of a diamagnetic susceptibility and a Curie-type susceptibility. The susceptibility \chi_{\rm{FC}} slightly decreases with increasing T above 20 K and becomes a negative constant (diamagnetic susceptibility) above 150 K: \chi_{d}=(-1.44\pm0.01) \times 10^{-7}\,emu/g at 298 K. Similar T dependence of \chi is observed in 1T-TaS_{2} below 150 K. [18, 19] A steplike change \chi near 200 K for 1T-TaS_{2} is due to the CDW transition between a high-temperature incommensurate phase and a low-temperature commensurate phase. As seen in Fig. 11 there is no such anomaly above 20 K in Ta_{2}S_{2}C. The inset of Fig. 11 shows the T dependence of \chi_{\rm{FC}} at H=10, 20, and 30 kOe. The susceptibility is strongly dependent on H below 10 K, indicating that M_{\rm{FC}} is nonlinear in H (see also the data of M_{\rm{ZFC}} vs H in Fig. 12). Note that the discontinuous jump of \chi_{\rm{FC}} observed in the vicinity of \chi_{\rm{FC}}=0 is an artifact due to the SQUID measurement. Almost all the data between 10 and 16 K are removed from the figure. The least-squares fit of the data of \chi_{\rm{FC}} vs T at H=10 kOe for 4\,\leqslant\,T\,\leqslant\,43 K to

\[\chi_{\rm{FC}}=\chi_{0}+C/(T-\Theta)\,,\] (1)

yields the T-independent susceptibility \chi_{0}=(-1.80\pm0.02) \times 10^{-7}\,emu/g, the Curie-Weiss constant C=(2.91\pm0.04) \times 10^{-6}\,emu K/g, and the Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta=-2.37\pm0.07 K. The magnitude of \chi_{0} is slightly larger than that of \chi_{d} determined above. The susceptibility \chi_{\rm{FC}} consists of a Curie-type behavior at low T and a diamagnetic contribution at high T. We assume that the Curie-type behavior is due to the localized electron spins having the effective magnetic moment P_{\rm{eff}}=g[S(S+1)]^{1/2}\mu_{B}=\sqrt{3}\mu_{B}, where the Lande g-factor g=2 and the spin S=1/2. This localized magnetic moment could be related to the Anderson localization (see Sec. IV.2). Through the repulsive Coulomb interaction between the electrons, a singly occupied state exists in the vicinity of \epsilon_{F}. Then the number of spins per gram of Ta_{2}S_{2}C (N_{g}) can be estimated as N_{g}=4.67\times 10^{18}/g (or 4.3 \times 10^{9}/cm^{3}) from the Curie-Weiss constant. In summary, the superconductivity below T_{c\rm{f}}, which is dominant at low H, is

  weakened as H increases and overcome by the localization effect at high H well above H_{c2}^{(l)}(0).

There may be another possibility that the Curie-Weiss behaviour is due to magnetic impurities (for example, Fe^{2+}), which may be contained in original Ta (typically 15 ppm Fe in the pristine 1T-TaS_{2}).[19] However, this possibility may be ruled out in the following way. If each Fe^{2+} ion has the effective magnetic moment (=5.4\mu_{B}), then the number of Fe^{2+} spins per gram of Ta_{2}S_{2}C is estimated as N_{g}=2.0 \times10^{19}/g. The magnitude of Fe^{2+} impurities is estimated as 1800 ppm, which is too large compared to \approx15 ppm as major metallic impurities in Ta_{2}S_{2}C. Similar Curie-Weiss behavior is observed in the susceptibility of 1T-TaS_{2}: \chi_{0}= -1.96\times10^{-7} emu/g, \Theta=0.4 K, and C=0.806 \times10^{-6} emu K/g.[18] These values of \chi_{0}, \Theta, and C are comparable to those derived in the present work for Ta_{2}S_{2}C. The Curie-type behavior in 1T-TaS_{2} is not due to magnetic impurities, but due to the localized magnetic moments related to the Anderson localization effect.[18, 19] The diamagnetic susceptibility is common to the 1T-polytypes showing CDW's. In 1T-TaS_{2}, the effect of the ordering of the commensurate CDW below 200 K is clearly observed in a discontinuous jump in the electrical resistivity.[18, 19] In Ta_{2}S_{2}C the T dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho has been reported by Ziebarath _et al.[3]_ using a pressed- and sintered-sample. The resistivity increases with increasing T for 4.2 \leq T\leq 300 K (\rho\approx 0.8 m \Omega cm at 4.2 K and 2.2 m \Omega cm at 300 K), showing a metallic behavior. Unlike the resistivity of 1T-TaS_{2}, no discontinuous change in \rho has been observed below 300 K.

### M_{\rm ZFC} vs H at low T and high H

Figure 12 shows the H dependence of M_{\rm ZFC} at fixed T below T_{cl}. The magnetization M_{\rm ZFC} is negative at low H because of the Meissner effect. The sign of M_{\rm ZFC} changes to positive at a zero-crossing field H_{0}(T). The value of H_{0} (=5.6 kOe at 1.9 K) coincides with that evaluated from the relation H_{c2}^{(l)}(T)=H_{c2}^{(l)}(0)[1 - (T/T_{cl})^{2}]. The magnetization M_{\rm ZFC} increases with further increasing H. It shows a broad peak, which shifts to the high-H side with increasing T: 22.5 kOe at 1.9 K and 29 kOe at 3.5 K. This peak arises from a competition between the Curie-type behavior (\Delta M_{\rm ZFC}) and the diamagnetic contribution (\chi_{d}H). In Fig. 13 we show the plot of a magnetization \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} as a function of H^{+}/T, where \Delta M_{\rm ZFC}=M_{\rm ZFC}-\chi_{d}H with \chi_{d}=-1.44 \times 10^{-7} emu/g, and H=10^{4}H^{*} (H and H^{*} are in the units of Oe and Tesla, respectively). The curves of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} vs H^{*}/T, which are slightly different for different T, increase with increasing H^{*}/T. The function form of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} vs H^{*}/T will be discussed in Sec. IV B.

## IV Discussion

### Origin of successive phase transitions at T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu}

We find that Ta_{2}S_{2}C undergoes successive superconducting transitions at T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu}. The diamagnetic volume fraction (21%) indicates that our system is formed of many small grains. The T and H dependence of \chi_{\rm ZFC} and \chi_{\rm FC} below T_{cl} is very different from that between T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu}: \delta\chi> 0 for T<T_{cl} and \delta\chi\approx 0 (\delta\chi> 0) for T_{cl}<T<T_{\rm eu}. The difference \delta\chi at a fixed T below T_{cl} decreases with increasing H. In contrast, \delta\chi at a fixed T between T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu} increases with increasing H, showing a maximum around H=500 Oe, and decreases with further increasing H. We note that similar successive transitions have been reported in a ceramic superconductor YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (T_{cl}=37 K and T_{\rm eu}=80 K),[26, 27] which consists of small grains. Below T_{\rm eu}, \chi_{\rm ZFC} (=\chi_{\rm FC}) becomes negative. The difference \delta\chi appears below T_{cl}. The difference \delta\chi at a fixed T below T_{cl} decreases with increasing H.

The successive phase transitions at T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu} in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} can be qualitatively explained by Kawachi _et al.[26]_ by taking into account the role of the superconducting grain below T_{\rm eu} and clusters below T_{cl}. According to their model, our results of Ta_{2}S_{2}C can be explained as follows. Below T_{\rm eu} the superconductivity occurs in each grain. In the presence of H well above H_{c1}^{(u)}, the fluxoids are pinned by pinning centers such as defects and vacancies within grains. A very weak irreversible effect of magnetization suggests that the density of fluxoids pinned in each grain for the FC state is slightly larger than the ZFC state. The distribution of fluxoids in the FC state is more uniform, while in the ZFC state more fluxoids are concentrated in the grain-boundary, which does not contribute to \chi_{\rm ZFC}.[28, 29] Below T_{cl}, the superconductivity occurs in clusters formed of grains coupled through weak intergrain Josephson couplings. In the presence of H, the system is divided into relatively free regions (the cluster-boundary region) and strong-pinned regions (within the clusters). In the FC state, the distribution of the fluxoids is more uniform inside the clusters. In the ZFC state, more fluxoids are concentrated in the cluster-boundary regions which may have little contribution to \chi_{\rm ZFC}. In the presence of H(<H_{c1}^{(l)}) applied to the system in the ZFC state, the fluxoids will enter only the cluster-boundary regions around the clusters. The fluxoids in the intercluster region can have a path through the system without being caught by clusters.

  When H>\,H_{c1}^{(l)}, some free fluxoids are caught by the clusters and pinned strongly, which contributes to \chi_{\rm ZFC}. Because of such an increase in \chi_{\rm ZFC}, \delta\chi decreases with increasing H.

The possible existence of mesoscopic grains in the Ta-C layers of Ta_{2}S_{2}C would be essential to the successive transitions having a hierarchical nature. The superconductive ordering proceeds in two steps from the intraplanar Josephson couplings between grains in the same Ta-C layers to the interplanar Josephson interaction between grains in adjacent Ta-C layers separated by TaS_{2}-type structure. In the intermediate phase between T_{\rm cr} and T_{\rm cJ}, each grain in Ta-C layers becomes a superconductor. Through the intraplanar Josephson coupling between grains, the region of the superconducting grains becomes larger as T decreases below T_{\rm cr}, forming a 2D superconducting phase. Thermal fluctuations overcome the interplanar Josephson coupling. Just below T_{\rm cJ}, the effective interplanar Josephson coupling becomes strong enough to give rise to a 3D superconducting phase. The 2D superconducting systems are coupled to each other through a weak interplanar Josephson coupling between adjacent Ta-C layers.

We note that the magnetic analogy to the successive phase transitions of such a hierarchical nature is seen in a stage-2 CoCl_{2} graphite intercalation compound (GIC): [30]T_{\rm cr} (=8.9 K) and T_{\rm cJ} (=6.8-7.2 K). The existence of islands is essential to the successive phase transitions. The nearest neighbor spins inside islands are ferromagnetically coupled with intraplanar exchange interactions. On approaching T_{\rm cr} from the high-T side, spins come to order ferromagnetically inside islands. At T_{\rm cr} these ferromagnetic islands continue to order over the same layer through interisland interactions (mainly ferromagnetic), forming a 2D ferromagnetic long-range order. Below T_{\rm cJ} a reentrant spin-glasslike phase order is established through effective antiferromagnetic interplanar interactions between spins in adjacent intercalate layers, where the antiferromagnetic phase and the spin glass phase coexist.

### Anderson localization effect

We have shown that in Ta_{2}S_{2}C, the susceptibility \chi_{\rm FC} at low T and high H obeys the Curie law, which is a direct evidence of the appearance of local magnetic moments of unpaired electrons due to the Anderson localization effect. A theory for the magnetic susceptibility in systems with both localization and electron-electron interactions is presented by Kobayashi _et al._, [31] and Kamimura and Aoki. [32] It is assumed that there are localized states with energies very close to the Fermi level \epsilon_{F}. Single occupied states are energetically favorable by virtue of intrastate Coulomb interaction (U>\,0) between spin-up and spin-down electrons in the same localized state. In the presence of H, the magnetization contribution m_{i} of the ith localized state with energy \epsilon_{i}, relative to \epsilon_{F}, can be written as

\[m_{i}\!=\mu_{B}[e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{i}-\mu_{B}H)}-e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{i}+\mu_{ B}H)}]/Z,\] (2)

where \beta=\,1\,/(k_{B}T), \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton, and Z is the partition function given by

\[Z=1+e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{i}-\mu_{B}H)}+e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{i}+\mu_{B}H)}+e^{- \beta(2\epsilon_{i}+U)},\] (3)

corresponding to an empty state, a state occupied by a spin-up electron with the energy \epsilon_{i}\!-\!\mu_{B}H, a state occupied by a spin-down electron with the energy \epsilon_{i}\!+\!\mu_{B}H , and a state occupied by spin-up and spin-down electrons with 2 \epsilon_{i}\!+\!U. Then the total magnetization M_{\epsilon} is obtained as

\[M_{\epsilon}=\frac{N(0)\mu_{B}\sinh(\beta\mu_{B}H)}{\beta[\cosh^ {2}(\beta\mu_{B}H)-e^{-\beta U}]^{1/2}}\] \[\times\!\ln\!\frac{\cosh(\beta\mu_{B}H)+[\cosh^{2}(\beta\mu_{B}H) -e^{-\beta U}]^{1/2}}{\cosh(\beta\mu_{B}H)-[\cosh^{2}(\beta\mu_{B}H)-e^{-\beta U }]^{1/2}},\] (4)

where N(0) is the density of states at \epsilon_{F}. For U=0, M is equal to the Pauli paramagnetism M_{P}=\,2N(0)\mu_{B}^{2}H. Here we define \Delta M^{*} as \Delta M^{*}=(M_{\epsilon}\!-\!M_{P})/(k_{B}N(0)\mu_{B}), where H is in the unit of Oe and U is in the unit of K: U=\,27 K for the pristine 11 TaS_{2}. Figure 14 shows the plot of \Delta M^{*} as a function of H^{*}/T for 0\leq\,H^{*}\leq\,10 T and T=\,1.9 and 3.5 K as U is changed as a parameter, where H^{*} is in the units of Tesla. For comparison, the Brillouin function given by M_{B}^{*}=\,U\tanh(\beta\mu_{B}H) is also plotted for each U. Although \Delta M^{*} depends on both H^{*}/T and U/T for each U, the curve of \Delta M^{*} vs H^{*}/T for each U fits well with M_{B}^{*} with the same U. Note that M_{B}^{*} is a little larger than \Delta M^{*} at the same H^{*}/T for 0\leq\,H^{*}/T\leq\,3. The magnetization \Delta M^{*} at H^{*}/T=\,5 is equal to the saturation magnetization (=U) of M_{B}^{*}. This implies that \Delta M^{*} with U coincides with the magnetization of free electron spins whose number is given by N(0)U.

Here we discuss our result shown in Fig. 13 based on the above model. As shown Fig. 13, all the data of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} vs H^{*}/T do not fall on a single-valued function of H^{*}/T. This is consistent with the expression given by Eq. (4). Negative values of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} for H^{*}/T<\,0.3 are due to the Meissner

Figure 14: (Color online) Plot of \Delta M^{*}=(M_{\epsilon}\!-\!M_{P})/(k_{B}N(0)\mu_{B}) for T=\,1.9 K (dashed-dotted line) and T=\,3.5 K (dotted line), and the Brillouin function given by M_{B}^{*}=U\tanh(\mu_{B}H/k_{B}T) (solid line) as a function of H^{*}/T as the intrastate Coulomb interaction U (in the units of K) is changed as a parameter. U=\,27 K for 17-TaS_{2} (Ref. [19]). M_{\epsilon} is defined by Eq. (4). M_{P} is the Pauli paramagnetism given by M_{P}=\,2N(0)\mu_{B}^{2}H.

  effect. In Fig. 13 a solid line denotes a Brillouin function given by N_{g}\mu_{B} tanh(0.6717H^{*}/_T_) with N_{g}\mu_{B}=0.019 emu/g or N_{g}=2.1 x 10^{18}/g, where N_{g}=N(0)U. Our data of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} vs H^{*}/_T_ greatly deviates downward from this Brillouin function for H^{*}/_T_>1. In Fig. 13 the magnetization \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} reaches 0.012 emu/g at H^{*}/_T_=2.5. Since the saturation magnetization is N_{g}\mu_{B}, the value of N_{g} can be estimated as N_{g}=1.3 x 10^{18}/g. We also note N_{g}=4.7 x 10^{18}/g (N_{g}\mu_{B} =0.044 emu/g) in the limit of H^{*}/_T_ ~ 0, which is evaluated from the Curie-Weiss constant (see Sec. III.6). Alternative method to determine N_{g} is as follows. We assume that M_{\rm ZFC}=\chi_{d}H+N_{g}\mu_{B} tanh(\beta\mu_{B}_H_). The magnetization M_{\rm ZFC} at fixed T_{1} has a local maximum at H^{*}=H_{1}^{*}: N_{g}=1.6053 \times 10^{24}T_{\chi_{d}} cosh(2.0671713H_{1}^{*}/_T_1). Using the values of H_{1}^{*} and T_{1} determined from the inset of Fig. 12 and \chi_{d}=-1.44 x 10^{-1} emu/g, N_{g} is calculated as N_{g}=(0.91 \pm 0.05) x 10^{18}/g. This value of N_{g} is close to that for 1 T-TaS_{2} (N_{g}=1.3 x 10^{18}/g) which is calculated from the Curie-Weiss constant (C_{g}=0.806 x 10^{-6} emu/g) obtained by DiSalvo and Waszczak.[18] For comparison, in Fig. 13 we also show the Brillouin function with these values of N_{g}, as a function of H^{*}/_T_. We do not find any reasonable value of N_{g}, which leads to good agreement between the result and the Brillouin function over the whole range of H^{*}/_T_. Similar behavior has also been observed in 1T-TaS_{2}: the downward deviation of the observed magnetization from the Brillouin function (corresponding to the case of N_{g}=2.1 x 10^{18}/g in Fig. 13) occurs for H^{*}/_T_ ~ 0.25.[19] One of the reason for such a difference between the theory and experiment is that that U is assumed to be constant in the above model. The intrastate Coulomb energy U_{i}=U(\epsilon_{i}) is considered to decrease with increasing \epsilon_{i}. The total energy 2**\epsilon_{i}+U_{i}** is needed for the state i to be occupied by the spin-up and spin-down electrons. If 2**\epsilon_{i}+U_{i}**>0, the ith state is occupied by a single electron which behaves as a free spin. If 2**\epsilon_{i}+U_{i}**<0, the ith state is occupied by paired electrons.[33] The number of free spins is given by N(0)\Delta U, where \Delta U is the region where free spins can situate on the localized states. The replacement of U by \Delta U (<U) leads to a decrease in the saturation magnetization. Thus the downward deviation of the magnetization from the Brillouin function with U in Ta_{2}S_{2}C and 1T-TaS_{2} can be qualitatively explained in terms of this replacement.

## V Conclusion

Two phenomena (the superconductivity and the Anderson localization effect) are observed in Ta_{2}S_{2}C. The structure of Ta_{2}S_{2}C can be viewed as a sum of Ta-C layers and TaS_{2}-type structure. The superconductivity is mainly due to the Ta-C layers, while the Anderson localization effect is due to TaS_{2}-type structure. Ta_{2}S_{2}C undergoes successive superconducting transitions of a hierachical nature at T_{cl} =3.61 \pm 0.01 K and T_{cu}=8.9 \pm 0.1 K. The intermediate phase between T_{cu} and T_{cl} is an intragrain superconductive state occurring in the Ta-C layers in Ta_{2}S_{2}C, while the low temperature phase below T_{cl} is an intergrain superconductive state. The T dependence of magnetic susceptibility at H well above 10 kOe and the H dependence of M_{\rm ZFC} at low T and high H are described by a sum of a diamagnetic susceptibility and a Curie-type behavior. The latter shows that the Anderson localization effect occurs in the 1T-TaS_{2}-type structure in Ta_{2}S_{2}C, leading to the localized magnetic moments due to unpaired electrons just below \epsilon_{F}.

24 September that Ta_{2}S_{2}C sample consists of a 3R phase as a majority phase and a 1T phase as a minority phase.[6] The sample characterization was carried out by scanning tunneling microscopy[9] and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.[10] The measurements of dc and ac magnetic susceptibility were carried out using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS XL-5). A polycrystalline powdered sample (mass 253.2 mg) was used in the present work. Before setting up a sample at 298 K, a remnant magnetic field was reduced to less than 3 mOe using an ultralow field capability option. For convenience, hereafter this remnant field is noted as the state H=0. The detail of the measurements of dc and ac magnetic susceptibility is described in Sec. III.

## III Result

### \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime}

Figure 1 shows the T dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility [(a) the dispersion \chi^{\prime} and (b) the absorption \chi^{\prime}], where the ac frequency f (=1 Hz) and the magnitude of the ac field (h=0.5 Oe) are used. The T dependence of \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime} is strongly dependent on H. The sign of \chi^{\prime} is negative at least for 1.9 < T< 5 K, while the sign of \chi^{\prime\prime} is positive. For H=0 [see the inset of Fig. 1(a)], \chi^{\prime} increases with increasing T. It shows a kink at a critical temperature T_{cl} (=3.61 K) where the derivative \mathrm{d}\chi^{\prime}/\mathrm{d}T undergoes a discontinuous jump. The system undergoes a superconducting transition at T_{cl}. The absorption \chi^{\prime\prime} at H=0 shows a drastic decrease around T_{cl} [see Fig. 2(c) for detail]. It shows a tail above T_{cl} and is reduced to zero around 5 K. The temperature at which the tangential line \chi^{\prime\prime} vs T with the steepest slope intersects the \chi^{\prime}=0 axis coincides with T_{cl}.

In Figs. 2(a)-2(c) we show the T dependence of \chi^{\prime} and \chi^{\prime\prime} at f=0.1 Hz and h=0.5 Oe for 0 \leq H\leq 5 kOe. The dispersion \chi^{\prime} shows a kink-like behavior at T_{cl}(H), increases with

  further increasing T and reduces to zero at T_{x}(_H_). In the plot of (-_kh_') vs T in Fig. 2(b), two steplike changes are clearly observed at T_{i}(_H_) and T_{x}(_H_). Although _kh_'' drastically decreases at T_{i}(_H_) with increasing T [see Fig. 2(c)], no drastic change in _kh_' is observed at T_{x}(_H_) in contrast to the case of -_kh_' vs T. The critical temperatures T_{i}(_H_) and T_{x}(_H_) decrease with increasing H, forming the _H_-_T_ phase diagram (see Sec. III E).

### _M-H_ loop

Figure 3(a) shows the hysteresis loop of the magnetization M at _T_=1.9 K. After the sample was quenched from 298 to 1.9 K at _H_=0, the measurement was carried out with varying H from 0 to 1 kOe at T, from _H_=1 to -1 kOe, and from _H_=-1 to 1 kOe. The _M-H_ curve at 1.9 K shows a large hysteresis and a remnant magnetization. Structural imperfections or defect in the sample may play a role of flux pinning, resulting in a inhomogeneous type-II superconductor. Figure 3(b) shows typical data of zero-field cooled (ZFC) magnetization _M_ZFC vs H at various T. Before each measurement, the sample was kept at 20 K and _H_=0 for 20 min and then it was quenched from 20 K to T (<4 K). The magnetization _M_ZFC at T was measured with increasing H (0 \leq_H_ \leq 120 Oe). The magnetization _M_ZFC exhibits a single local minimum at a characteristic field for T <T_{i}, shifting to the low-_H_ side with increasing T. The lower critical field H_{c1}^{(l)}(T) is defined not as the first minimum point of the _M_ZFC vs H, but as the first deviation point from the linear portion due to the penetration of magnetic flux into the sample: typically, H_{c1}^{(l)}(T=1.9 K) =20 Oe and H_{c1}^{(l)}(T=2.7 K) =12 Oe. The least-squares fit of the data of H_{c1}^{(l)} vs T to a conventional relation [20]H_{c1}^{(l)}(T) = H_{c1}^{(l)}(0)[1-(T/T_{c1})^{2}] yields H_{c1}^{(l)}(0) =28 \pm 2 Oe.

### _kh_ZFC and _kh_FC

The measurements of _kh_ZFC (=_M_ZFC/_H_) and _kh_FC (=_M_FC/_H_) were carried out as follows, where _M_FC is the field-cooled (FC) magnetization. After annealing at 50 K for 1200 s in the absence of H, the sample was quenched from 50 to 1.9 K. The magnetic field H was applied at 1.9 K and then _kh_ZFC was measured with increasing T. The sample was again heated up and annealed at 50 K for 1200 s in the presence of H. Then _kh_FC was measured with decreasing T. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the T dependence of _kh_ZFC, _kh_FC, and _kh_x_ at _H_=1 Oe, where _kh_x_=_kh_FC-_kh_ZFC. The scale of the susceptibility is enlarged in Fig. 4(b). The susceptibility _kh_ZFC (_kh_FC) exhibits a kink at T_{i} (=3.61 K), where \text{d}\chi_{\text{ZFC}}/\text{d}T (d\chi_{\text{ZFC}}/\text{d}T) undergoes a drastic decrease. The deviation of _kh_ZFC from _kh_FC is clearly seen below T_{i} (=3.61 K), indicating that the extra magnetic flux is trapped during the FC process. Between T_{i} and T_{x} (=8.9 K), _kh_x_ is still positive but almost equal to zero. The sign of _kh_ZFC (_kh_FC) changes from negative to positive at T_{u}. Similar behavior is also observed at H = 20 Oe as shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). Figure 5 shows the T dependence of _kh_x at various H. The value of _kh_x_ at fixed T decreases with increasing H. The difference _kh_x_ undergoes a drastic decrease at T_{i}(_H_).

The minimum value of _kh_ZFC at H = 1 Oe is -1.7 \times 10^{-3} emu/g at 1.9 K, while the minimum value of _kh_' at H = 0 is -1.8 x 10^{-3} emu/g at 1.9 K. Using the value of _kh_' at 1.9 K (=-1.8 x 10^{-3} emu/g) and the calculated density for 3R-Ta_{2}S_{2}C (_p_cal=9.23 g/cm^{3}),[1] the fraction of flux expulsion relative to complete diamagnetism (_kh_0 = -1/4 \pi= -0.0796 emu/cm^{3}) is estimated as 21%, suggesting that the system consists of small grains. This is in contrast to 38% of the diamagnetic volume fraction reported for Nb_{2}S_{2}C by Sakamaki _et al.[11]_

Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the T dependence of _kh_ZFC at various H, where the measurement was carried out between 1.9 and 11 K with increasing T. There is a drastic increase in the diamagnetic contribution in _kh_ZFC associated with the superconducting transition at T_{i}(_H_). Nevertheless, a diamagnetic contribution in _kh_ZFC still remains above T_{i}(_H_). The susceptibility _kh_ZFC increases with further increasing T, and reduces to a zero at an upper critical temperature T_{x}(_H_). For H = 500 Oe, for example, _kh_ZFC exhibits a kink at T_{i}(_H_). The sign of _kh_ZFC changes from negative to positive around 9 K with increasing T. At H = 5 kOe, _kh_ZFC is positive at least between 1.9 and 6 K, showing a broad peak at 2.65 K. At H = 10 kOe, _kh_ZFC decreases with increasing T, showing a

  Curie-type behavior. Figure 7(a) shows the T dependence of \delta\chi at various H. The magnitude of \delta\chi between T_{cl}(H) and T_{cu}(H) is very small compared to that below T_{cl}(H), but still shows the irreversible effect of magnetization. The difference \delta\chi at fixed H decreases with increasing T and reduces to zero at T_{cu}(H). Note that \delta\chi at fixed T (for example 5 K) increases with increasing H, showing a maximum around H=500 Oe, and decreases with further increasing H. This feature is in contrast to the H dependence of \delta\chi below T_{cl}(H), which decreases with increasing H. Figure 7(b) shows the T dependence of the derivative {\rm d}\chi_{\rm ZFC}/{\rm d}T for 5 Oe\congH\leq 10 kOe. Clearly {\rm d}\chi_{\rm ZFC}/{\rm d}T at low H undergoes two steplike changes around T_{cl}(H) and T_{cu}(H). The critical temperatures T_{cl}(H) and T_{cu}(H) decrease with increasing H, forming the H-T phase diagram (see Sec. III E).

### \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} in a quasiequilibrium state

Here we present our peculiar results on the T dependence of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}. The method of the measurement for \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} is slightly different from that for the conventional \chi_{\rm ZFC}. First, the sample was annealed at 50 K for 1200 s in the absence of H and then it was quenched to 1.9 K. After the sample was kept at 1.9 K for 100 s in the presence of fixed H, it was quickly heated up to T_{0} between T_{cl} and T_{cur}. Then \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} was measured with increasing T from T_{0} to 11 K. Figures 8(a)-8(d) show the T dependence of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}, \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}, and \chi_{\rm FC} at various H (5, 10, 30, and 50 Oe), where T_{0}=5 K. The T dependence of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} at the same H is independent of T_{0} when T_{0} is between 4 and 8 K. The data of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} vs T at H=1 and 20 Oe are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(d), respectively. The susceptibility \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} increases with increasing T and reduces to zero at T_{cu}(H). The magnitudes of \chi_{\rm ZFC}, \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}, and \chi_{\rm FC} at the same T are strongly dependent on H: \chi_{\rm ZFC}>\chi_{\rm FC}>\chi_{\rm ZFC} for H=1\,-30 Oe, \chi_{\rm FC}>\chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}>\chi_{\rm ZFC} for H=50 Oe, and \chi_{\rm FC}>\chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC}=\chi_{\rm ZFC} for H=100 and 150 Oe (the data are not shown in Fig. 8). Note that \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} at H=1 Oe [see Fig. 4(b)], whose sign is positive, decreases with increasing T and reduces to zero at T_{cu}. Between T_{cl} and T_{cu}, the space of states is divided into at least three states, the ZFC, ZFC^{*}, and FC state. The system lies in the FC states under the cooling from 11 K, the ZFC state under the slow heating from 1.9 K, and

T dependence of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} (5\leqT\leq 10 K) is also shown for comparison. The definition of \chi^{*}_{\rm ZFC} is given in Sec. III D.

  the ZFC^{+} state under the rapid heating from 1.9 K. The value of H (=30 Oe) is slightly higher than the lower critical field H_{c1}^{(l)}(T=1.9 K) =20 Oe. The susceptibility of each state provides a measure for the corresponding induced magnetic flux density B which is trapped in the superconducting grains: B = H + 4 \pi M. The inequality \chi_{\rm ZFC}^{+}>\chi_{\rm FC} indicates that the induced magnetic flux density (or the number of fluxoids over the system ) in the ZFC^{+} state is higher than that in the FC state for H<30 Oe. Such a relatively high flux density in the ZFC^{+} state may be due to a flux compression as a result of the rapid redistribution of the grain-pinned vortices which occurs during a change of T from 1.9 K to T_{0}. This effect exists only at low H. In this sense, the present effect is similar to the paramagnetic Meissner effect observed in \chi_{FC} of the pristine Nb:[21, 22]\chi_{\rm FC} at low H becomes positive below the superconducting transition temperature. According to Koshelev and Larkin,[23] the surface supercurrent inhomogeneously traps the magnetic flux in the sample interior, as a vortex. In Sec. IV A we discuss a possible distribution of vortices around the grains in the ZFC and FC states below T_{cl} and between T_{cl} and T_{car}.

### _H-T_ diagram

Figure 9 shows the _H-T_ phase diagram, where T_{cl}(H) is determined from the data of \chi^{\prime} vs T and \chi^{\prime\prime} vs T, and T_{car}(H) is determined from the data of \chi_{\rm ZFC} vs T. These lines correspond to the lines H_{c2}^{(l)}(T) and H_{c2}^{(h)}(T). The least squares-fit of the data of H vs T for the line H_{c2}^{(l)}(T) to a conventional relation H_{c2}^{(l)}(T)=H_{c2}^{(l)}(0)([1 - (T/T_{cl})^{2}] yields H_{c2}^{(l)}(0)= 7.7 \pm 0.2 KOe and T_{cl}=3.61 \pm 0.01 K, where the data of \chi^{\prime} vs \

 obtained from the linear relation in H_{c2}^{(l)} vs T in the vicinity of T=T_{cl} and H_{c2}^{(l)}=0.

The coherence length \xi and the magnetic penetration depth \lambda are related to H_{c1}^{(l)}(0) and H_{c2}^{(l)}(0) through relations H_{c1}^{(l)}(0)=\Phi_{0}f(2\pi\xi^{2}) and H_{c1}^{(l)}(0)=(\Phi_{0}/4\,\pi\lambda^{2})ln(\  T_{c} of the pristine TaC_{1-x} increases with decreasing x and is equal to 9.0 K at x=0.019. Fink _et al._[13] have reported that the values of H_{c1} and H_{c2} at T=1.2 K for TaC are 220 Oe and 4.6 kOe. These values are on the same order as the values of T_{cw} and H_{c2}^{(w)}(0) in Ta_{2}S_{2}C. The origin of the superconductivity at T_{c\rm{f}} and T_{cw} will be discussed in Sec. IV.1.

### \chi_{\rm{ZFC}} and \chi_{\rm{FC}} at high H and high T

In Fig. 10 we show the T dependence of \chi_{\rm{FC}} at various H. The susceptibility \chi_{\rm{FC}} (also \chi_{\rm{ZFC}}) at H=20 Oe shows a sharp peak around 9.5 K and decreases with further increasing T. The sign of \chi_{\rm{FC}} changes from positive to negative around 16 K. The discontinuous jump of \chi observed in the vicinity of \chi=0 is an artifact due to the SQUID measurement. In contrast, \chi_{\rm{FC}} (=\chi_{\rm{ZFC}}) at H=10 kOe decreases with increasing T from 1.9 K and merges to the curves of \chi_{\rm{FC}} at H=20 Oe above 9.5 K.

Figure 11 shows the T dependence of \chi_{\rm{FC}} at H=10 kOe for 1.9\,\leqslant\,T\,\leqslant\,298 K. The susceptibility \chi consists of a diamagnetic susceptibility and a Curie-type susceptibility. The susceptibility \chi_{\rm{FC}} slightly decreases with increasing T above 20 K and becomes a negative constant (diamagnetic susceptibility) above 150 K: \chi_{d}=(-1.44\pm0.01) \times 10^{-7}\,emu/g at 298 K. Similar T dependence of \chi is observed in 1T-TaS_{2} below 150 K. [18, 19] A steplike change \chi near 200 K for 1T-TaS_{2} is due to the CDW transition between a high-temperature incommensurate phase and a low-temperature commensurate phase. As seen in Fig. 11 there is no such anomaly above 20 K in Ta_{2}S_{2}C. The inset of Fig. 11 shows the T dependence of \chi_{\rm{FC}} at H=10, 20, and 30 kOe. The susceptibility is strongly dependent on H below 10 K, indicating that M_{\rm{FC}} is nonlinear in H (see also the data of M_{\rm{ZFC}} vs H in Fig. 12). Note that the discontinuous jump of \chi_{\rm{FC}} observed in the vicinity of \chi_{\rm{FC}}=0 is an artifact due to the SQUID measurement. Almost all the data between 10 and 16 K are removed from the figure. The least-squares fit of the data of \chi_{\rm{FC}} vs T at H=10 kOe for 4\,\leqslant\,T\,\leqslant\,43 K to

\[\chi_{\rm{FC}}=\chi_{0}+C/(T-\Theta)\,,\] (1)

yields the T-independent susceptibility \chi_{0}=(-1.80\pm0.02) \times 10^{-7}\,emu/g, the Curie-Weiss constant C=(2.91\pm0.04) \times 10^{-6}\,emu K/g, and the Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta=-2.37\pm0.07 K. The magnitude of \chi_{0} is slightly larger than that of \chi_{d} determined above. The susceptibility \chi_{\rm{FC}} consists of a Curie-type behavior at low T and a diamagnetic contribution at high T. We assume that the Curie-type behavior is due to the localized electron spins having the effective magnetic moment P_{\rm{eff}}=g[S(S+1)]^{1/2}\mu_{B}=\sqrt{3}\mu_{B}, where the Lande g-factor g=2 and the spin S=1/2. This localized magnetic moment could be related to the Anderson localization (see Sec. IV.2). Through the repulsive Coulomb interaction between the electrons, a singly occupied state exists in the vicinity of \epsilon_{F}. Then the number of spins per gram of Ta_{2}S_{2}C (N_{g}) can be estimated as N_{g}=4.67\times 10^{18}/g (or 4.3 \times 10^{9}/cm^{3}) from the Curie-Weiss constant. In summary, the superconductivity below T_{c\rm{f}}, which is dominant at low H, is

  weakened as H increases and overcome by the localization effect at high H well above H_{c2}^{(l)}(0).

There may be another possibility that the Curie-Weiss behaviour is due to magnetic impurities (for example, Fe^{2+}), which may be contained in original Ta (typically 15 ppm Fe in the pristine 1T-TaS_{2}).[19] However, this possibility may be ruled out in the following way. If each Fe^{2+} ion has the effective magnetic moment (=5.4\mu_{B}), then the number of Fe^{2+} spins per gram of Ta_{2}S_{2}C is estimated as N_{g}=2.0 \times10^{19}/g. The magnitude of Fe^{2+} impurities is estimated as 1800 ppm, which is too large compared to \approx15 ppm as major metallic impurities in Ta_{2}S_{2}C. Similar Curie-Weiss behavior is observed in the susceptibility of 1T-TaS_{2}: \chi_{0}= -1.96\times10^{-7} emu/g, \Theta=0.4 K, and C=0.806 \times10^{-6} emu K/g.[18] These values of \chi_{0}, \Theta, and C are comparable to those derived in the present work for Ta_{2}S_{2}C. The Curie-type behavior in 1T-TaS_{2} is not due to magnetic impurities, but due to the localized magnetic moments related to the Anderson localization effect.[18, 19] The diamagnetic susceptibility is common to the 1T-polytypes showing CDW's. In 1T-TaS_{2}, the effect of the ordering of the commensurate CDW below 200 K is clearly observed in a discontinuous jump in the electrical resistivity.[18, 19] In Ta_{2}S_{2}C the T dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho has been reported by Ziebarath _et al.[3]_ using a pressed- and sintered-sample. The resistivity increases with increasing T for 4.2 \leq T\leq 300 K (\rho\approx 0.8 m \Omega cm at 4.2 K and 2.2 m \Omega cm at 300 K), showing a metallic behavior. Unlike the resistivity of 1T-TaS_{2}, no discontinuous change in \rho has been observed below 300 K.

### M_{\rm ZFC} vs H at low T and high H

Figure 12 shows the H dependence of M_{\rm ZFC} at fixed T below T_{cl}. The magnetization M_{\rm ZFC} is negative at low H because of the Meissner effect. The sign of M_{\rm ZFC} changes to positive at a zero-crossing field H_{0}(T). The value of H_{0} (=5.6 kOe at 1.9 K) coincides with that evaluated from the relation H_{c2}^{(l)}(T)=H_{c2}^{(l)}(0)[1 - (T/T_{cl})^{2}]. The magnetization M_{\rm ZFC} increases with further increasing H. It shows a broad peak, which shifts to the high-H side with increasing T: 22.5 kOe at 1.9 K and 29 kOe at 3.5 K. This peak arises from a competition between the Curie-type behavior (\Delta M_{\rm ZFC}) and the diamagnetic contribution (\chi_{d}H). In Fig. 13 we show the plot of a magnetization \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} as a function of H^{+}/T, where \Delta M_{\rm ZFC}=M_{\rm ZFC}-\chi_{d}H with \chi_{d}=-1.44 \times 10^{-7} emu/g, and H=10^{4}H^{*} (H and H^{*} are in the units of Oe and Tesla, respectively). The curves of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} vs H^{*}/T, which are slightly different for different T, increase with increasing H^{*}/T. The function form of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} vs H^{*}/T will be discussed in Sec. IV B.

## IV Discussion

### Origin of successive phase transitions at T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu}

We find that Ta_{2}S_{2}C undergoes successive superconducting transitions at T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu}. The diamagnetic volume fraction (21%) indicates that our system is formed of many small grains. The T and H dependence of \chi_{\rm ZFC} and \chi_{\rm FC} below T_{cl} is very different from that between T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu}: \delta\chi> 0 for T<T_{cl} and \delta\chi\approx 0 (\delta\chi> 0) for T_{cl}<T<T_{\rm eu}. The difference \delta\chi at a fixed T below T_{cl} decreases with increasing H. In contrast, \delta\chi at a fixed T between T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu} increases with increasing H, showing a maximum around H=500 Oe, and decreases with further increasing H. We note that similar successive transitions have been reported in a ceramic superconductor YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} (T_{cl}=37 K and T_{\rm eu}=80 K),[26, 27] which consists of small grains. Below T_{\rm eu}, \chi_{\rm ZFC} (=\chi_{\rm FC}) becomes negative. The difference \delta\chi appears below T_{cl}. The difference \delta\chi at a fixed T below T_{cl} decreases with increasing H.

The successive phase transitions at T_{cl} and T_{\rm eu} in YBa_{2}Cu_{4}O_{8} can be qualitatively explained by Kawachi _et al.[26]_ by taking into account the role of the superconducting grain below T_{\rm eu} and clusters below T_{cl}. According to their model, our results of Ta_{2}S_{2}C can be explained as follows. Below T_{\rm eu} the superconductivity occurs in each grain. In the presence of H well above H_{c1}^{(u)}, the fluxoids are pinned by pinning centers such as defects and vacancies within grains. A very weak irreversible effect of magnetization suggests that the density of fluxoids pinned in each grain for the FC state is slightly larger than the ZFC state. The distribution of fluxoids in the FC state is more uniform, while in the ZFC state more fluxoids are concentrated in the grain-boundary, which does not contribute to \chi_{\rm ZFC}.[28, 29] Below T_{cl}, the superconductivity occurs in clusters formed of grains coupled through weak intergrain Josephson couplings. In the presence of H, the system is divided into relatively free regions (the cluster-boundary region) and strong-pinned regions (within the clusters). In the FC state, the distribution of the fluxoids is more uniform inside the clusters. In the ZFC state, more fluxoids are concentrated in the cluster-boundary regions which may have little contribution to \chi_{\rm ZFC}. In the presence of H(<H_{c1}^{(l)}) applied to the system in the ZFC state, the fluxoids will enter only the cluster-boundary regions around the clusters. The fluxoids in the intercluster region can have a path through the system without being caught by clusters.

  When H>\,H_{c1}^{(l)}, some free fluxoids are caught by the clusters and pinned strongly, which contributes to \chi_{\rm ZFC}. Because of such an increase in \chi_{\rm ZFC}, \delta\chi decreases with increasing H.

The possible existence of mesoscopic grains in the Ta-C layers of Ta_{2}S_{2}C would be essential to the successive transitions having a hierarchical nature. The superconductive ordering proceeds in two steps from the intraplanar Josephson couplings between grains in the same Ta-C layers to the interplanar Josephson interaction between grains in adjacent Ta-C layers separated by TaS_{2}-type structure. In the intermediate phase between T_{\rm cr} and T_{\rm cJ}, each grain in Ta-C layers becomes a superconductor. Through the intraplanar Josephson coupling between grains, the region of the superconducting grains becomes larger as T decreases below T_{\rm cr}, forming a 2D superconducting phase. Thermal fluctuations overcome the interplanar Josephson coupling. Just below T_{\rm cJ}, the effective interplanar Josephson coupling becomes strong enough to give rise to a 3D superconducting phase. The 2D superconducting systems are coupled to each other through a weak interplanar Josephson coupling between adjacent Ta-C layers.

We note that the magnetic analogy to the successive phase transitions of such a hierarchical nature is seen in a stage-2 CoCl_{2} graphite intercalation compound (GIC): [30]T_{\rm cr} (=8.9 K) and T_{\rm cJ} (=6.8-7.2 K). The existence of islands is essential to the successive phase transitions. The nearest neighbor spins inside islands are ferromagnetically coupled with intraplanar exchange interactions. On approaching T_{\rm cr} from the high-T side, spins come to order ferromagnetically inside islands. At T_{\rm cr} these ferromagnetic islands continue to order over the same layer through interisland interactions (mainly ferromagnetic), forming a 2D ferromagnetic long-range order. Below T_{\rm cJ} a reentrant spin-glasslike phase order is established through effective antiferromagnetic interplanar interactions between spins in adjacent intercalate layers, where the antiferromagnetic phase and the spin glass phase coexist.

### Anderson localization effect

We have shown that in Ta_{2}S_{2}C, the susceptibility \chi_{\rm FC} at low T and high H obeys the Curie law, which is a direct evidence of the appearance of local magnetic moments of unpaired electrons due to the Anderson localization effect. A theory for the magnetic susceptibility in systems with both localization and electron-electron interactions is presented by Kobayashi _et al._, [31] and Kamimura and Aoki. [32] It is assumed that there are localized states with energies very close to the Fermi level \epsilon_{F}. Single occupied states are energetically favorable by virtue of intrastate Coulomb interaction (U>\,0) between spin-up and spin-down electrons in the same localized state. In the presence of H, the magnetization contribution m_{i} of the ith localized state with energy \epsilon_{i}, relative to \epsilon_{F}, can be written as

\[m_{i}\!=\mu_{B}[e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{i}-\mu_{B}H)}-e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{i}+\mu_{ B}H)}]/Z,\] (2)

where \beta=\,1\,/(k_{B}T), \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton, and Z is the partition function given by

\[Z=1+e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{i}-\mu_{B}H)}+e^{-\beta(\epsilon_{i}+\mu_{B}H)}+e^{- \beta(2\epsilon_{i}+U)},\] (3)

corresponding to an empty state, a state occupied by a spin-up electron with the energy \epsilon_{i}\!-\!\mu_{B}H, a state occupied by a spin-down electron with the energy \epsilon_{i}\!+\!\mu_{B}H , and a state occupied by spin-up and spin-down electrons with 2 \epsilon_{i}\!+\!U. Then the total magnetization M_{\epsilon} is obtained as

\[M_{\epsilon}=\frac{N(0)\mu_{B}\sinh(\beta\mu_{B}H)}{\beta[\cosh^ {2}(\beta\mu_{B}H)-e^{-\beta U}]^{1/2}}\] \[\times\!\ln\!\frac{\cosh(\beta\mu_{B}H)+[\cosh^{2}(\beta\mu_{B}H) -e^{-\beta U}]^{1/2}}{\cosh(\beta\mu_{B}H)-[\cosh^{2}(\beta\mu_{B}H)-e^{-\beta U }]^{1/2}},\] (4)

where N(0) is the density of states at \epsilon_{F}. For U=0, M is equal to the Pauli paramagnetism M_{P}=\,2N(0)\mu_{B}^{2}H. Here we define \Delta M^{*} as \Delta M^{*}=(M_{\epsilon}\!-\!M_{P})/(k_{B}N(0)\mu_{B}), where H is in the unit of Oe and U is in the unit of K: U=\,27 K for the pristine 11 TaS_{2}. Figure 14 shows the plot of \Delta M^{*} as a function of H^{*}/T for 0\leq\,H^{*}\leq\,10 T and T=\,1.9 and 3.5 K as U is changed as a parameter, where H^{*} is in the units of Tesla. For comparison, the Brillouin function given by M_{B}^{*}=\,U\tanh(\beta\mu_{B}H) is also plotted for each U. Although \Delta M^{*} depends on both H^{*}/T and U/T for each U, the curve of \Delta M^{*} vs H^{*}/T for each U fits well with M_{B}^{*} with the same U. Note that M_{B}^{*} is a little larger than \Delta M^{*} at the same H^{*}/T for 0\leq\,H^{*}/T\leq\,3. The magnetization \Delta M^{*} at H^{*}/T=\,5 is equal to the saturation magnetization (=U) of M_{B}^{*}. This implies that \Delta M^{*} with U coincides with the magnetization of free electron spins whose number is given by N(0)U.

Here we discuss our result shown in Fig. 13 based on the above model. As shown Fig. 13, all the data of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} vs H^{*}/T do not fall on a single-valued function of H^{*}/T. This is consistent with the expression given by Eq. (4). Negative values of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} for H^{*}/T<\,0.3 are due to the Meissner

Figure 14: (Color online) Plot of \Delta M^{*}=(M_{\epsilon}\!-\!M_{P})/(k_{B}N(0)\mu_{B}) for T=\,1.9 K (dashed-dotted line) and T=\,3.5 K (dotted line), and the Brillouin function given by M_{B}^{*}=U\tanh(\mu_{B}H/k_{B}T) (solid line) as a function of H^{*}/T as the intrastate Coulomb interaction U (in the units of K) is changed as a parameter. U=\,27 K for 17-TaS_{2} (Ref. [19]). M_{\epsilon} is defined by Eq. (4). M_{P} is the Pauli paramagnetism given by M_{P}=\,2N(0)\mu_{B}^{2}H.

  effect. In Fig. 13 a solid line denotes a Brillouin function given by N_{g}\mu_{B} tanh(0.6717H^{*}/_T_) with N_{g}\mu_{B}=0.019 emu/g or N_{g}=2.1 x 10^{18}/g, where N_{g}=N(0)U. Our data of \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} vs H^{*}/_T_ greatly deviates downward from this Brillouin function for H^{*}/_T_>1. In Fig. 13 the magnetization \Delta M_{\rm ZFC} reaches 0.012 emu/g at H^{*}/_T_=2.5. Since the saturation magnetization is N_{g}\mu_{B}, the value of N_{g} can be estimated as N_{g}=1.3 x 10^{18}/g. We also note N_{g}=4.7 x 10^{18}/g (N_{g}\mu_{B} =0.044 emu/g) in the limit of H^{*}/_T_ ~ 0, which is evaluated from the Curie-Weiss constant (see Sec. III.6). Alternative method to determine N_{g} is as follows. We assume that M_{\rm ZFC}=\chi_{d}H+N_{g}\mu_{B} tanh(\beta\mu_{B}_H_). The magnetization M_{\rm ZFC} at fixed T_{1} has a local maximum at H^{*}=H_{1}^{*}: N_{g}=1.6053 \times 10^{24}T_{\chi_{d}} cosh(2.0671713H_{1}^{*}/_T_1). Using the values of H_{1}^{*} and T_{1} determined from the inset of Fig. 12 and \chi_{d}=-1.44 x 10^{-1} emu/g, N_{g} is calculated as N_{g}=(0.91 \pm 0.05) x 10^{18}/g. This value of N_{g} is close to that for 1 T-TaS_{2} (N_{g}=1.3 x 10^{18}/g) which is calculated from the Curie-Weiss constant (C_{g}=0.806 x 10^{-6} emu/g) obtained by DiSalvo and Waszczak.[18] For comparison, in Fig. 13 we also show the Brillouin function with these values of N_{g}, as a function of H^{*}/_T_. We do not find any reasonable value of N_{g}, which leads to good agreement between the result and the Brillouin function over the whole range of H^{*}/_T_. Similar behavior has also been observed in 1T-TaS_{2}: the downward deviation of the observed magnetization from the Brillouin function (corresponding to the case of N_{g}=2.1 x 10^{18}/g in Fig. 13) occurs for H^{*}/_T_ ~ 0.25.[19] One of the reason for such a difference between the theory and experiment is that that U is assumed to be constant in the above model. The intrastate Coulomb energy U_{i}=U(\epsilon_{i}) is considered to decrease with increasing \epsilon_{i}. The total energy 2**\epsilon_{i}+U_{i}** is needed for the state i to be occupied by the spin-up and spin-down electrons. If 2**\epsilon_{i}+U_{i}**>0, the ith state is occupied by a single electron which behaves as a free spin. If 2**\epsilon_{i}+U_{i}**<0, the ith state is occupied by paired electrons.[33] The number of free spins is given by N(0)\Delta U, where \Delta U is the region where free spins can situate on the localized states. The replacement of U by \Delta U (<U) leads to a decrease in the saturation magnetization. Thus the downward deviation of the magnetization from the Brillouin function with U in Ta_{2}S_{2}C and 1T-TaS_{2} can be qualitatively explained in terms of this replacement.

## V Conclusion

Two phenomena (the superconductivity and the Anderson localization effect) are observed in Ta_{2}S_{2}C. The structure of Ta_{2}S_{2}C can be viewed as a sum of Ta-C layers and TaS_{2}-type structure. The superconductivity is mainly due to the Ta-C layers, while the Anderson localization effect is due to TaS_{2}-type structure. Ta_{2}S_{2}C undergoes successive superconducting transitions of a hierachical nature at T_{cl} =3.61 \pm 0.01 K and T_{cu}=8.9 \pm 0.1 K. The intermediate phase between T_{cu} and T_{cl} is an intragrain superconductive state occurring in the Ta-C layers in Ta_{2}S_{2}C, while the low temperature phase below T_{cl} is an intergrain superconductive state. The T dependence of magnetic susceptibility at H well above 10 kOe and the H dependence of M_{\rm ZFC} at low T and high H are described by a sum of a diamagnetic susceptibility and a Curie-type behavior. The latter shows that the Anderson localization effect occurs in the 1T-TaS_{2}-type structure in Ta_{2}S_{2}C, leading to the localized magnetic moments due to unpaired electrons just below \epsilon_{F}.
