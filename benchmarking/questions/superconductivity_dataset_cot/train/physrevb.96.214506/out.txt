###### Abstract

In this study, the superconducting gap symmetry of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe is elucidated through specific heat measurements with one single crystal of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe. A clear jump is observed at 3.95 K in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe, suggesting bulk superconductivity. From specific heat measurements, \Delta C_{\epsilon}/\gamma\,T_{\epsilon} and 2A(0)/k_{\text{B}}T_{\epsilon} are obtained as 2.31 and 4.5. These values indicate strong electron-phonon coupling superconductivity. The temperature (T) and magnetic-field (H) dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\epsilon}(T,H) suggests that superconductivity is fully gapped. Our handmade system successfully elucidates superconducting gap symmetry of the BiS_{2}-based compound with a small single crystal.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity of the BiS_{2}-based layered compounds Bi_{4}O_{3}S_{4} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} has attracted much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Their crystal structure consists of the LaO-blocking and BiS_{2}-conducting layers, and is very similar to FeAs-based high-T_{\epsilon} superconductor. By analogy with the FeAs-based superconductor and the BiS_{2}-based superconductor, it is highly possible that the origin of the superconducting (SC) transition mechanism is unconventional.

The band structure calculation suggests the existence of a strong nesting of the Fermi surface at wave vector \mathbf{k}=(\pi,\pi)[7, 8, 9, 10]. The importance of the nesting is experimentally pointed out and shows the possibility that electronic correlations play an important role in the emergence of superconductivity of these systems. However, it was argued that the effect of the electron correlation is a trivial factor in this system. The conduction band in the two-dimensional (2D) layer of BiS_{2}-based compounds is mainly contributed from 6p_{x} and 6p_{y} orbits of Bi [10]. Because of the widely spread 6p orbitals, the electron correlation effects appear to be unimportant. A strong electron correlation is significant for unconventional superconductivity. Thus, it is a central issue to elucidate whether interactions that mediate the Cooper pair of superconductivity are unconventional.

Extensive theoretical studies have proposed the SC gap structures, which are intimately related to the paring interaction [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Experimentally, unconventional superconductivity can be expected to be generated because an extremely large ratio of 2\Delta/k_{\text{B}}T_{\epsilon}\sim 17, which is about five times larger than the BCS theory, is found in scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements [14].

To determine SC gap symmetry, \muSR measurements of polycrystalline Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} are performed, and suggest that superconductivity is fully gapped [15]. Furthermore, several measurements of a single crystal of Nd(O, F)BiS_{2} imply fully gapped superconductivity. Raman scattering suggests a possible phonon-mediated superconductivity [16]. Penetration depth and thermal conductivity measurements have been reported for a fully gapped superconductor [17, 18]. However, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement suggests that NdO_{0.71}F_{0.29}BiS_{2} is an unconventional superconductor that has competitive or cooperative multiple pairing interactions [19]. Thus, SC symmetry of the BiS_{2}-based compounds is controversial.

Specific heat is one of the most significant tools for understanding the SC state and to confirm the bulk nature of superconductivity thermodynamically. However, specific heat measurements have not been performed to clarify SC gap symmetry in BiS_{2}-superconductors, even though confirmation about the bulk nature of superconductivity has been reported [20, 21, 22]. The difficulty in measuring the specific heat of BiS_{2}-compounds at low temperatures is due to the need of treating a small single crystal with a small Sommerfeld coefficient. To overcome the present situation, we constructed a handmade sensitive calorimeter, which allows us to implement high-precision measurements, and is a powerful tool to determine SC symmetry.

In this paper, we report temperature and magnetic-field dependences of specific heat C(T,H) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe by using the sensitive calorimeter with one piece of single crystal (less than 1 mg). The Se-substituted compounds LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}Bi(S_{1-x}Se_{x})_{2} are known to exhibit bulk superconductivity with the optimum Se content x of 0.5 [23, 24]. Through our measurements, we have succeeded to elucidate the SC-gap symmetry of the BiS_{2}-based compound by using one piece of single crystal.

## II Experimental details and results

Single crystals of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe were grown by using a CsCl/NaCl-flux method [25, 26]. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the typical size of the single crystals is approximately 1 \times 1 mm^{2}. The crystal structure of the synthesized single-crystalline sample was examined through powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) implemented using a conventional x-ray spectrometer equipped with Cu-K\alpha radiation and a graphite monochromator (RAD-2X, Rigaku). The lattice  constants of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe were estimated to be 0.41074 and 1.3486 nm, and of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe were 0.40512 and 1.3410 nm. These values are almost consistent with those of the previous reports [23,24].

Superconductivity was confirmed by the T dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) measurements, which were performed using a conventional four-probe method with a current source (Model 6221, Keithley) and a nanovoltmeter (Model 2182A, Keithley), down to 0.5 K in zero and various applied magnetic fields. Gold wires were attached to the sample surface by Ag paste. Figure 1(c) shows \rho(T) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe up to room temperature. \rho(T) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} shows semimetallic behavior with a residual resistivity \rho_{0} of approximately 5.8 m\Omegacm: whereas \rho(T) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe behaves as almost T-linear dependent with \rho_{0}=0.47 m\Omegacm. Both compounds show superconductivity. T_{\rm c} in \rho(T) is defined as a 50% drop from \rho_{0}, and the superconducting transition width \Delta T is taken as the temperature interval between 10% and 90% of \rho_{0}. T_{\rm c} is determined to be 2.2 and 3.95 K with \Delta T=0.7 and 0.02 K, respectively.

Only one piece of specimen is sufficient to perform specific heat measurements because the background value is comparative to the raw data of the sample even at 0.5 K. Specific heat measurements were performed through a relaxation method down to 0.4 K by using a commercial ^{3}He refrigerator (Heliox-VL, Oxford Instruments) equipped with a superconducting magnet (Oxford instruments). Our handmade system consists of a heater and thermometer (RuO_{2} chip resistor) without a sample stage. The sample was sandwiched between the heater and thermometer, which were hung by using NbTi SC wires attached using an Ag paste on the surfaces of the RuO_{2} chip resistor to form an electrode. As the bottom of the chip resistor consists of an Al_{2}O_{3} insulator, the sample cannot be electrically contacted with the heater and thermometer. Figure 1(d) presents the setup for the measurement of C(T). A single crystal of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} (1.40 mg) and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe (0.42 mg) fixed using N grease between the heater and thermometer was used for the measurements. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the T dependence of the specific heat C(T) divided by T of raw data (sample + background) and background down to 0.4 K. The contribution of the background is relatively smaller than that of one specimen. The background value is comparable to that of the sample even at 0.4 K. Thus, we determined the validity that our handmade system enables us to measure the accurate values of small single crystals of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe.

Figures 2(e) and 2(f) show C(T)/T of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe in zero magnetic field. The bulk nature of the superconductivity can be confirmed because of the clear jump at T_{\rm c}=3.95 K, which is consistent with T_{\rm c} determined by \rho(T). The transition is very sharp with a transition width of 0.2 K, indicating good sample quality. However, no jump was observed in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, although the slope seems to change at the temperature in which \rho(T) shows zero resistivity. This result suggests that superconductivity of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} is not of bulk nature. These results correspond to those of magnetic susceptibility measurements.

Figure 3(a) shows C(T)/T of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe in magnetic fields of 0 and 1 T. To describe the specific heat data at \mu_{0}H=1.0 T, which exceeds H_{\rm c2}(0), we use the following expression: C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4}, where \gamma is the electronic specific heat coefficient (Sommerfeld constant), and \beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4}(=C_{\rm ph}) is the lattice vibration contribution. We obtained

  parameters \gamma=4.19 mJ/(mol K2), \beta=1.34 mJ/(mol K4), and \delta=0.0198 mJ/(mol K6). In a simple Debye model of the phonon contribution, the \beta coefficient is related to the Debye temperature \Theta_{\text{D}}=(\frac{12\pi^{2}}{3\beta}n\,R)^{1/3}, where R=8.314 J/(mol K) is the gas constant and n=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit. From this relationship, \Theta_{\text{D}} is estimated to be 194 K.

Next, we discuss the detailed T dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\text{e}}(T) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe. Figure 3(b) shows C_{\text{e}}(T) divided by T of the Se-doped sample. C_{\text{e}}(T)/T was fitted to the theoretical curve assuming an isotropically gapped SC state, based on the following equations [27]:

\[\frac{S}{\gamma_{n}T_{\text{c}}}=-\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{\text{B }}T_{\text{c}}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[f\,\ln f+(1-f)\ln(1-f)\right]dy,\] (1)

\[\frac{C}{\gamma_{n}T_{\text{c}}}=t\frac{d(S/\gamma_{n}T_{\text{c}})}{dt},\] (2)

where f=\left[\text{exp}(\beta E)+1\right]^{-1} and \beta=\left(k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}\right)^{-1}. The energy of quasiparticles is given by E=\left[\varepsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}(t)\right]^{1/2}, where \varepsilon is the energy of the normal electrons relative to the Fermi energy. In addition, the T dependence of an energy gap varies as \Delta(t)=\Delta(0)\delta(t), where \delta(t) is the normalized BCS gap, as calculated by Muhlschlegel [28]. The result reproduces the experimental data quite well in a wide temperature range just below T_{\text{c}} down to 0.5 K. The entropy balance is satisfied, and we obtained T_{\text{c}}=3.95 K and \Delta(0)/k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}=2.25, where \Delta(0) is the amplitude of the SC gap at T\to 0 K (solid line). The value is clearly smaller than 2\Delta/k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}\sim 17 obtained from STM [14]. For comparison, we also plot the BCS curve for the weak electron-phonon coupling limit (dotted line).

As shown in Fig. 3(b), a clear residual linear term \gamma_{0}=0.60 mJ/(mol K2) is observed in the T\to 0 K limit from C(T)/T. This may have originated from a small fraction of the non-SC phases. After subtracting the impurity concentration \gamma_{0}, we found the Sommerfeld coefficient to be \gamma_{n}=\gamma-\gamma_{0}=3.59 mJ/(mol K2). The normalized specific heat jump was estimated to be \Delta C_{\text{e}}/\gamma\,T_{\text{c}}=2.31, which is larger than 1.43 in the weak-coupling limit. Our results strongly suggest a strong electron-phonon coupling.

Next, we discuss the H dependence of the low-temperature part of the electronic specific heat C_{\text{e}}(H), which is known to be very sensitive to the SC structure. The inset of Fig. 3(b) shows C_{\text{e}}(H) divided by T at 0.5 K in magnetic field applied perpendicular to the ab plane (H||c). C_{\text{e}}(H)/T shows an H-linear dependence in a wide magnetic-field range. Rapid increase detected from the H dependence of the thermal conductivity \kappa(H) of NdO_{0.71}F_{0.29}BiS_{2} is not seen in C_{\text{e}}(H). We note a small upturn of C_{\text{e}}(T)/T at approximately 0.5 K in zero magnetic field. The origin is likely to be a nuclear specific heat but the upturn is suppressed in higher magnetic filed. We consider that the upturn is ascribed to the background contribution, which is insufficiently subtracted from raw data [29]. The increase is about 0.18 and 0.015 mJ/(mol K2) in magnetic fields of 0 and 0.2 T. The effect of the upturn on C_{\text{e}}(H) is vanishingly small enough to discuss the SC gap even in 0.5 K. Thus, C_{\text{e}}(H) also provides supporting evidence for a fully gapped SC state.

The upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}(T) was obtained from the \rho(T) measurements in several magnetic fields, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The \mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}(T) curves show clear enhancement from the Wertharmer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory [30, 31] in the dirty limit (dotted line) and upper curvature around T_{\text{c}}. The features are usually understood as a multigap SC, but are also originated from spin-orbit and/or strong electron-phonon coupling [31, 32]. Because our measurements suggest a single SC gap, it is inadequate to employ the multigap fit. The H_{\text{c2}}(0) was estimated from the fitting formula H_{\text{c2}}(T)=H_{\text{c2}}(0)[1-(T/T_{\text{c}})^{3/2}]^{3/2} for superconductors with upper curvature [33]. The \mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}(0) was evaluated to be approximately 18.5 T for H||ab and 0.572 T for H||c. This value is consistent with that of the previous report [25]. The anisotropic parameter \Gamma was determined using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) formula.

\[\Gamma=\frac{m_{c}}{m_{ab}}=\frac{H_{\text{c2}}^{||ab}}{H_{\text{c2}}^{||c}}= \frac{\xi_{ab}}{\xi_{c}},\] (3)

where m_{i} (i=ab, c) are the effective mass and \xi_{i} (i=ab, c) are GL-coherence length. We calculate the \xi_{i} by using H_{\text{c2}}^{||ab}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}) and H_{\text{c2}}^{||c}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2}), where \Phi_{0} is the quantum flux. The \xi_{ab} and \xi_{c} were estimated to be 24.0 and 0.742 nm. The \Gamma was obtained to be approximately 32.3, suggesting that the superconductor has remarkably high anisotropy.

Figure 3: (a) T dependence of the specific heat C(T) divided by T of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe in magnetic fields of 0, 0.2, and 1 T. The dotted line is the fitting result of C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4}. The inset shows the T^{2} dependence of C(T)/T at the low-temperature region. (b) Electronic specific heat C_{\text{e}}(T) divided by T. The solid line shows the theoretical calculation of the \alpha model. The dotted lines represent the calculated BCS curve assuming a weak-coupling limit. The inset shows the H dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\text{e}}(H) divided by T at 0.5 K.

  As shown in Fig. 4(c), the thermodynamic critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(T), which is directly related to the condensation energy of the superconductor through \Delta F=H_{\rm c}^{2}/8\pi, was estimated by using the relationship,

\[\Delta F(T)=F_{\rm n}-F_{\rm s}=\int_{T_{\rm c}}^{T}dT^{\prime}\int_{T_{\rm c}}^{ T}(C_{\rm n}/T^{\prime\prime}-C_{\rm s}/T^{\prime\prime})dT^{\prime\prime}.\] (4)

The inset of Fig. 4(c) shows that H_{\rm c}(T) follows the parabolic form H_{\rm c}(T)=H_{\rm c}(0)(1-t^{2}), where t=T/T_{\rm c}, at low temperatures. \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0) is determined unambiguously from an extrapolation to T=0, and the obtained value is \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0)=18.5 mT.

We calculated the SC parameters for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe on the basis of the \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) and \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0) values. According to the GL theory, the GL-coherence length \xi(0) and GL parameter \kappa(0)=\lambda(0)/\xi(0) can be obtained from \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0), \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0), and \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0):\mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0)=\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)/\sqrt{2}\kappa(0), \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=\mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0)^{2}/H_{\rm c2}(0)[\ln\kappa(0)+0.08], and \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=\Phi_  (No. 26800183), the Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant (26-207) from the Japan Science Society, the Uchida Energy Science Promotion Foundation (26-1-22), and Sasaki Environment Technology Foundation.

###### Abstract

In this study, the superconducting gap symmetry of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe is elucidated through specific heat measurements with one single crystal of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe. A clear jump is observed at 3.95 K in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe, suggesting bulk superconductivity. From specific heat measurements, \Delta C_{\epsilon}/\gamma\,T_{\epsilon} and 2A(0)/k_{\text{B}}T_{\epsilon} are obtained as 2.31 and 4.5. These values indicate strong electron-phonon coupling superconductivity.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity of the BiS_{2}-based layered compounds Bi_{4}O_{3}S_{4} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} has attracted much attention [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Their crystal structure consists of the LaO-blocking and BiS_{2}-conducting layers, and is very similar to FeAs-based high-T_{\epsilon} superconductor. By analogy with the FeAs-based superconductor and the BiS_{2}-based superconductor, it is highly possible that the origin of the superconducting (SC) transition mechanism is unconventional.

The band structure calculation suggests the existence of a strong nesting of the Fermi surface at wave vector \mathbf{k}=(\pi,\pi)[7, 8, 9, 10]. The importance of the nesting is experimentally pointed out and shows the possibility that electronic correlations play an important role in the emergence of superconductivity of these systems. However, it was argued that the effect of the electron correlation is a trivial factor in this system. The conduction band in the two-dimensional (2D) layer of BiS_{2}-based compounds is mainly contributed from 6p_{x} and 6p_{y} orbits of Bi [10]. Because of the widely spread 6p orbitals, the electron correlation effects appear to be unimportant. A strong electron correlation is significant for unconventional superconductivity. Thus, it is a central issue to elucidate whether interactions that mediate the Cooper pair of superconductivity are unconventional.

Extensive theoretical studies have proposed the SC gap structures, which are intimately related to the paring interaction [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Experimentally, unconventional superconductivity can be expected to be generated because an extremely large ratio of 2\Delta/k_{\text{B}}T_{\epsilon}\sim 17, which is about five times larger than the BCS theory, is found in scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements [14].

To determine SC gap symmetry, \muSR measurements of polycrystalline Bi_{4}O_{4}S_{3} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} are performed, and suggest that superconductivity is fully gapped [15]. Furthermore, several measurements of a single crystal of Nd(O, F)BiS_{2} imply fully gapped superconductivity. Raman scattering suggests a possible phonon-mediated superconductivity [16]. Penetration depth and thermal conductivity measurements have been reported for a fully gapped superconductor [17, 18]. However, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement suggests that NdO_{0.71}F_{0.29}BiS_{2} is an unconventional superconductor that has competitive or cooperative multiple pairing interactions [19]. Thus, SC symmetry of the BiS_{2}-based compounds is controversial.

Specific heat is one of the most significant tools for understanding the SC state and to confirm the bulk nature of superconductivity thermodynamically. However, specific heat measurements have not been performed to clarify SC gap symmetry in BiS_{2}-superconductors, even though confirmation about the bulk nature of superconductivity has been reported [20, 21, 22]. The difficulty in measuring the specific heat of BiS_{2}-compounds at low temperatures is due to the need of treating a small single crystal with a small Sommerfeld coefficient. To overcome the present situation, we constructed a handmade sensitive calorimeter, which allows us to implement high-precision measurements, and is a powerful tool to determine SC symmetry.

In this paper, we report temperature and magnetic-field dependences of specific heat C(T,H) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe by using the sensitive calorimeter with one piece of single crystal (less than 1 mg). The Se-substituted compounds LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}Bi(S_{1-x}Se_{x})_{2} are known to exhibit bulk superconductivity with the optimum Se content x of 0.5 [23, 24]. Through our measurements, we have succeeded to elucidate the SC-gap symmetry of the BiS_{2}-based compound by using one piece of single crystal.

## II Experimental details and results

Single crystals of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe were grown by using a CsCl/NaCl-flux method [25, 26]. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the typical size of the single crystals is approximately 1 \times 1 mm^{2}. The crystal structure of the synthesized single-crystalline sample was examined through powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) implemented using a conventional x-ray spectrometer equipped with Cu-K\alpha radiation and a graphite monochromator (RAD-2X, Rigaku). The lattice  constants of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe were estimated to be 0.41074 and 1.3486 nm, and of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe were 0.40512 and 1.3410 nm. These values are almost consistent with those of the previous reports [23,24].

Superconductivity was confirmed by the T dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho(T) measurements, which were performed using a conventional four-probe method with a current source (Model 6221, Keithley) and a nanovoltmeter (Model 2182A, Keithley), down to 0.5 K in zero and various applied magnetic fields. Gold wires were attached to the sample surface by Ag paste. Figure 1(c) shows \rho(T) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe up to room temperature. \rho(T) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} shows semimetallic behavior with a residual resistivity \rho_{0} of approximately 5.8 m\Omegacm: whereas \rho(T) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe behaves as almost T-linear dependent with \rho_{0}=0.47 m\Omegacm. Both compounds show superconductivity. T_{\rm c} in \rho(T) is defined as a 50% drop from \rho_{0}, and the superconducting transition width \Delta T is taken as the temperature interval between 10% and 90% of \rho_{0}. T_{\rm c} is determined to be 2.2 and 3.95 K with \Delta T=0.7 and 0.02 K, respectively.

Only one piece of specimen is sufficient to perform specific heat measurements because the background value is comparative to the raw data of the sample even at 0.5 K. Specific heat measurements were performed through a relaxation method down to 0.4 K by using a commercial ^{3}He refrigerator (Heliox-VL, Oxford Instruments) equipped with a superconducting magnet (Oxford instruments). Our handmade system consists of a heater and thermometer (RuO_{2} chip resistor) without a sample stage. The sample was sandwiched between the heater and thermometer, which were hung by using NbTi SC wires attached using an Ag paste on the surfaces of the RuO_{2} chip resistor to form an electrode. As the bottom of the chip resistor consists of an Al_{2}O_{3} insulator, the sample cannot be electrically contacted with the heater and thermometer. Figure 1(d) presents the setup for the measurement of C(T). A single crystal of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} (1.40 mg) and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe (0.42 mg) fixed using N grease between the heater and thermometer was used for the measurements. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the T dependence of the specific heat C(T) divided by T of raw data (sample + background) and background down to 0.4 K. The contribution of the background is relatively smaller than that of one specimen. The background value is comparable to that of the sample even at 0.4 K. Thus, we determined the validity that our handmade system enables us to measure the accurate values of small single crystals of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe.

Figures 2(e) and 2(f) show C(T)/T of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} and LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe in zero magnetic field. The bulk nature of the superconductivity can be confirmed because of the clear jump at T_{\rm c}=3.95 K, which is consistent with T_{\rm c} determined by \rho(T). The transition is very sharp with a transition width of 0.2 K, indicating good sample quality. However, no jump was observed in LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}, although the slope seems to change at the temperature in which \rho(T) shows zero resistivity. This result suggests that superconductivity of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2} is not of bulk nature. These results correspond to those of magnetic susceptibility measurements.

Figure 3(a) shows C(T)/T of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe in magnetic fields of 0 and 1 T. To describe the specific heat data at \mu_{0}H=1.0 T, which exceeds H_{\rm c2}(0), we use the following expression: C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4}, where \gamma is the electronic specific heat coefficient (Sommerfeld constant), and \beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4}(=C_{\rm ph}) is the lattice vibration contribution. We obtained

  parameters \gamma=4.19 mJ/(mol K2), \beta=1.34 mJ/(mol K4), and \delta=0.0198 mJ/(mol K6). In a simple Debye model of the phonon contribution, the \beta coefficient is related to the Debye temperature \Theta_{\text{D}}=(\frac{12\pi^{2}}{3\beta}n\,R)^{1/3}, where R=8.314 J/(mol K) is the gas constant and n=5 is the number of atoms per formula unit. From this relationship, \Theta_{\text{D}} is estimated to be 194 K.

Next, we discuss the detailed T dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\text{e}}(T) of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe. Figure 3(b) shows C_{\text{e}}(T) divided by T of the Se-doped sample. C_{\text{e}}(T)/T was fitted to the theoretical curve assuming an isotropically gapped SC state, based on the following equations [27]:

\[\frac{S}{\gamma_{n}T_{\text{c}}}=-\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{\text{B }}T_{\text{c}}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[f\,\ln f+(1-f)\ln(1-f)\right]dy,\] (1)

\[\frac{C}{\gamma_{n}T_{\text{c}}}=t\frac{d(S/\gamma_{n}T_{\text{c}})}{dt},\] (2)

where f=\left[\text{exp}(\beta E)+1\right]^{-1} and \beta=\left(k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}\right)^{-1}. The energy of quasiparticles is given by E=\left[\varepsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}(t)\right]^{1/2}, where \varepsilon is the energy of the normal electrons relative to the Fermi energy. In addition, the T dependence of an energy gap varies as \Delta(t)=\Delta(0)\delta(t), where \delta(t) is the normalized BCS gap, as calculated by Muhlschlegel [28]. The result reproduces the experimental data quite well in a wide temperature range just below T_{\text{c}} down to 0.5 K. The entropy balance is satisfied, and we obtained T_{\text{c}}=3.95 K and \Delta(0)/k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}=2.25, where \Delta(0) is the amplitude of the SC gap at T\to 0 K (solid line). The value is clearly smaller than 2\Delta/k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}\sim 17 obtained from STM [14]. For comparison, we also plot the BCS curve for the weak electron-phonon coupling limit (dotted line).

As shown in Fig. 3(b), a clear residual linear term \gamma_{0}=0.60 mJ/(mol K2) is observed in the T\to 0 K limit from C(T)/T. This may have originated from a small fraction of the non-SC phases. After subtracting the impurity concentration \gamma_{0}, we found the Sommerfeld coefficient to be \gamma_{n}=\gamma-\gamma_{0}=3.59 mJ/(mol K2). The normalized specific heat jump was estimated to be \Delta C_{\text{e}}/\gamma\,T_{\text{c}}=2.31, which is larger than 1.43 in the weak-coupling limit. Our results strongly suggest a strong electron-phonon coupling.

Next, we discuss the H dependence of the low-temperature part of the electronic specific heat C_{\text{e}}(H), which is known to be very sensitive to the SC structure. The inset of Fig. 3(b) shows C_{\text{e}}(H) divided by T at 0.5 K in magnetic field applied perpendicular to the ab plane (H||c). C_{\text{e}}(H)/T shows an H-linear dependence in a wide magnetic-field range. Rapid increase detected from the H dependence of the thermal conductivity \kappa(H) of NdO_{0.71}F_{0.29}BiS_{2} is not seen in C_{\text{e}}(H). We note a small upturn of C_{\text{e}}(T)/T at approximately 0.5 K in zero magnetic field. The origin is likely to be a nuclear specific heat but the upturn is suppressed in higher magnetic filed. We consider that the upturn is ascribed to the background contribution, which is insufficiently subtracted from raw data [29]. The increase is about 0.18 and 0.015 mJ/(mol K2) in magnetic fields of 0 and 0.2 T. The effect of the upturn on C_{\text{e}}(H) is vanishingly small enough to discuss the SC gap even in 0.5 K. Thus, C_{\text{e}}(H) also provides supporting evidence for a fully gapped SC state.

The upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}(T) was obtained from the \rho(T) measurements in several magnetic fields, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The \mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}(T) curves show clear enhancement from the Wertharmer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory [30, 31] in the dirty limit (dotted line) and upper curvature around T_{\text{c}}. The features are usually understood as a multigap SC, but are also originated from spin-orbit and/or strong electron-phonon coupling [31, 32]. Because our measurements suggest a single SC gap, it is inadequate to employ the multigap fit. The H_{\text{c2}}(0) was estimated from the fitting formula H_{\text{c2}}(T)=H_{\text{c2}}(0)[1-(T/T_{\text{c}})^{3/2}]^{3/2} for superconductors with upper curvature [33]. The \mu_{0}H_{\text{c2}}(0) was evaluated to be approximately 18.5 T for H||ab and 0.572 T for H||c. This value is consistent with that of the previous report [25]. The anisotropic parameter \Gamma was determined using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) formula.

\[\Gamma=\frac{m_{c}}{m_{ab}}=\frac{H_{\text{c2}}^{||ab}}{H_{\text{c2}}^{||c}}= \frac{\xi_{ab}}{\xi_{c}},\] (3)

where m_{i} (i=ab, c) are the effective mass and \xi_{i} (i=ab, c) are GL-coherence length. We calculate the \xi_{i} by using H_{\text{c2}}^{||ab}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}) and H_{\text{c2}}^{||c}=\Phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{ab}^{2}), where \Phi_{0} is the quantum flux. The \xi_{ab} and \xi_{c} were estimated to be 24.0 and 0.742 nm. The \Gamma was obtained to be approximately 32.3, suggesting that the superconductor has remarkably high anisotropy.

Figure 3: (a) T dependence of the specific heat C(T) divided by T of LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe in magnetic fields of 0, 0.2, and 1 T. The dotted line is the fitting result of C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}+\delta T^{4}. The inset shows the T^{2} dependence of C(T)/T at the low-temperature region. (b) Electronic specific heat C_{\text{e}}(T) divided by T. The solid line shows the theoretical calculation of the \alpha model. The dotted lines represent the calculated BCS curve assuming a weak-coupling limit. The inset shows the H dependence of the electronic specific heat C_{\text{e}}(H) divided by T at 0.5 K.

  As shown in Fig. 4(c), the thermodynamic critical field \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(T), which is directly related to the condensation energy of the superconductor through \Delta F=H_{\rm c}^{2}/8\pi, was estimated by using the relationship,

\[\Delta F(T)=F_{\rm n}-F_{\rm s}=\int_{T_{\rm c}}^{T}dT^{\prime}\int_{T_{\rm c}}^{ T}(C_{\rm n}/T^{\prime\prime}-C_{\rm s}/T^{\prime\prime})dT^{\prime\prime}.\] (4)

The inset of Fig. 4(c) shows that H_{\rm c}(T) follows the parabolic form H_{\rm c}(T)=H_{\rm c}(0)(1-t^{2}), where t=T/T_{\rm c}, at low temperatures. \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0) is determined unambiguously from an extrapolation to T=0, and the obtained value is \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0)=18.5 mT.

We calculated the SC parameters for LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiSSe on the basis of the \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0) and \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0) values. According to the GL theory, the GL-coherence length \xi(0) and GL parameter \kappa(0)=\lambda(0)/\xi(0) can be obtained from \mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0), \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0), and \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0):\mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0)=\mu_{0}H_{\rm c2}(0)/\sqrt{2}\kappa(0), \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=\mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0)^{2}/H_{\rm c2}(0)[\ln\kappa(0)+0.08], and \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)=\Phi_  (No. 26800183), the Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant (26-207) from the Japan Science Society, the Uchida Energy Science Promotion Foundation (26-1-22), and Sasaki Environment Technology Foundation.
