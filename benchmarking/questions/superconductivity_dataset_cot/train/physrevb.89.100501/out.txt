  superconducting gaps were obtained via lock-in technique with modulation signal voltage 0.05 mV with a frequency of 985 Hz. The samples are cleaved _in situ_ at 30 K as well as at room temperature. The dc magnetization measurements were performed on a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Temperature and magnetic fields dependent resistance measurements were carried out in the PPMS using the standard four-point probe technique with silver paste used for the contacts.

Figure 1 shows the crystal structure of IrTe_{2} and the XRD spectra from the doped and the undoped crystals. See from Fig. 1(c), except for the Si reference peak, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed by (007) peaks according to P_{3}^{\circ}m1 structure from Ir_{1-x}Pd_{x}Te_{2} with FWHM less than 0.05^{\circ}, which indicates the high crystalline quality of the samples. Si reference peaks were used to correct the system error. The (004) peaks were used to calculate the c-axis lattice constant. Based on the Bragg condition, the calculated c-axis lattice constant is 5.386 A and 5.372 A for IrTe_{2} and Ir_{1.95}Pb_{0.05}Te_{2}, respectively. After x=0.05 Pd doping, the lattice contacts by \sim0.26% which is consistent with the Pd-Te substitution known from the powder samples [18]. After cleaving, the surface is Te terminated. Figure 1(b) shows a well-ordered hexagonal lattice on the surface.

Typical low-temperature dc magnetic signal and electrical resistance of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} samples are shown in Fig. 2. A diamagnetic behavior, characteristic of a superconducting state, is observed below \sim2.5 K. The magnetization signal obtained at 2.1 K is about 60% of that expected for full diamagnetism. This represents a conservative lower limit to the true superconducting volume fraction because the diamagnetic magnetization is still decreasing steeply at the temperature where the field is applied for the zero field cooling measurement. Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of the resistance of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2}, measured in the ab plane. Consistent with magnetic measurement, resistance of the sample decreases at \sim2.5 K and reaches zero at \sim2 K, suggesting bulk superconductivity. As presented in the inset of Fig. 2(a), with x=0.05 Pd substitution the magnetic signal increases monotonically in the doped samples with the decrease of temperature under the magnetic field of 2 T. The structure phase transition is completely suppressed in Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2}, while IrTe_{2} shows a sharp transition at \sim270 K [18], marked by a black arrow.

Detailed measurements of the magnetic signals and the resistance as a function of magnetic fields are presented in Fig. 3. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the magnetization curves at different temperatures (from 2.1 K to 2.8 K) along out-of-plane (\perp) and in-plane (\parallel) direction, respectively. Seen from the magnetization curves, Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} has typical type-II superconductor behavior. As shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), the blue arrows mark the position of H_{\alpha 2\perp} and H_{\alpha 2\parallel}, where diamagnetic

  signals disappear at different temperatures. In the resistance data [Fig. 3(c)], the upper critical field H_{c2} was defined at the superconducting onset temperature. Figure 3(d) summarizes the H_{c2} as a function of temperature. The linear temperature dependence close to T_{c} is obtained for H_{c2}, suggesting the dominance of only one type of bulk carrier, which is consistent with ARPES measurement shown below. The solid line is the fitting to Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory based on the magnetic measurements. We obtained the upper critical field at zero temperature H_{c2,\perp}(0)=0.16\pm 0.05 T and H_{c2\parallel}(0)=0.33\pm 0.05 T. From H_{c2\perp}, the coherence length \xi_{\parallel}=\sqrt{\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2\perp}}=45 nm is obtained, while from H_{c2\parallel} we use \xi_{\parallel}\xi_{\perp}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi H_{c2\parallel} and obtain \xi_{\perp}=22 nm. So the dimensionless anisotropy parameter \gamma=\xi_{\parallel}/\xi_{\perp}\sim 2, which is smaller than another layered superconductor NbSe_{2} (\gamma\sim 3).

The properties of the superconducting state are further explored by low temperature STM/STS. Figure 4(a) shows the typical STS spectra obtained on the cleaved surface at 0.4 K. Well-defined coherence peaks corresponding to the superconducting state were observed clearly. The STS spectra can be nicely fitted using BCS-type s-wave formula, which gives a superconducting gap of 0.36\pm 0.02 meV at 0.4 K. Assuming the gap follows BCS theory, \Delta(T)=\Delta(0)(1-T/T_{c})^{1/2}, we get \Delta(0)\sim 0.39\pm 0.02 meV, yielding the BCS ratio 2\Delta/k_{B}T_{c}\sim 3.6. This value indicates a weak-coupling BCS-type superconductor (for weak-coupling limit s-wave, BCS ratio \sim3.5). The STS spectra as a function of applied magnetic fields are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). With the increase of applied magnetic field, the coherence peak faded away gradually. The energy gap disappears at about 0.11 T and 0.22 T when the magnetic field is perpendicular or parallel to the ab plane. It is worth noting that these two values are position dependent due to the existence of the vortex [vortices are shown in Fig. 4(d)] and the variation is much

  smaller when the magnetic field is applied in the _ab_ plane. Nevertheless, the upper critical fields obtained in STS are well consistent with macroscopic bulk measurements as shown in Fig. 3(d). Superconducting vortex was observed by STS mapping. Figure 4(d) shows the vortex with nice close-packed arrangement. From the size of the vortex, as shown in Fig. 4(e), the in plane coherence length \xi (T=0.4 K) of \sim51 \pm 5 nm is obtained from the fitting of the line profile [red line in Fig. 4(d)] of the vortex, which is nearly consistent with the value from the bulk magnetic measurement. Small BCS ratio, _s_-wave-like gap function and long coherence length suggest that Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} is a fully gapped and weak coupling BCS-type _s_-wave superconductor. In addition, we carefully checked the STS at different positions of vortex as shown in Fig. 4(f). The red curve in Fig. 4(f) is collected right at the center of a vortex. Outside the vortex, there is a superconducting gap and the gap closes at the center of the vortex. Under our experimental temperature (0.4 K), no sign of zero bias conductance peak was observed at any position of vortex, which means even if there will be nontrivial superconducting states, much lower temperature is needed. From the STS measurement, we think we can rule out the possibility of a topological superconducting state in this system at 0.4 K.

Finally, the electronic structures of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} are studied by ARPES. Same as IrTe_{2}, the energy bands of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} show strong _k_{z}_ dispersion. By tuning incident photon energy, we can change the detectable momentum along the normal direction (_k_{z}_). In-plane FS at different _k_{z}_ was obtained by integrating the spectra weight with an energy window of 15 meV at Fermi energy. Changing of FS topology was observed in previous studies in IrTe_{2} below and above the phase transition temperature [23,25]. Figure 5(a) shows the FS of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} measured at 30 K overlaid with the room temperature FS (green and blue dotted lines) of IrTe_{2} from Ref. [23] at the exact same _k_{z}_ (\sim 0.8\pi) point using 90 eV photon energy. Clearly, after Pd substitution, the FS of superconducting samples at low temperature is the same as that of IrTe_{2} at room temperature. There is one outer big FS, three small Fermi pockets, and a tiny Fermi pocket around zone center. Meanwhile, the three small Fermi pockets [blue dotted lines in Fig. 5(a)] disappear at 30 K in IrTe_{2} samples [23]. Figures 5(c) and 5(d) show energy bands along the direction indicated by the yellow dotted lines in Fig. 5(a). Known from the band mapping, all the FSs are formed by holelike bands. Since Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} has no phase transition but has identical FS as that of the IrTe_{2} sample above phase transition temperature, it implies that itinerant origins such as FS nesting or saddle point nesting may not play key roles for the phase transition in this system. Phase transition is more likely related to local phenomena. For example, the depolymerization-polymerization of Te bonds was proposed to be involved in the phase transition [26]. And it was also proposed that Ir Sd orbital reconstruction governed the charge and orbital instability in IrTe_{2}[19]. In addition, charge modulation originated from the periodic dimerization of Te atoms was observed in previous STM experiments [27]. Figure 5(b) presents the FS near \pi point. At this _k_{z}_ point, the saddle point (marked as "S" in the figure) observed in IrTe_{2}[23] remains in Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2}, which leaves the possibility that the superconducting instability can be related to the van Hove singularity at saddle points [23]. This scenario could be studied by ultralow temperature ARPES experiments in the future.

In summary, we did comprehensive studies of the superconducting properties and electronic structures of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2}. By combination of the macroscopic and microscopic measurements, the superconducting gap size, coherence length, and electronics structures as well as the vortex states were determined. At 0.4 K, the samples present a BCS-type _s_-wave-like superconducting behavior. Though no exotic superconducting state was found in this system, the hexagonal lattice structure of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} is very suitable for epitaxial growth of TIs. In our previous work, Bi_{2}Se_{3} (Bi_{2}Te_{3}) TI films were successfully grown on _s_-wave superconductor NbSe_{2}[28,29]. This type of heterostructure utilizing the superconducting proximity effect perpendicular to the _ab_ plane is called vertical geometry. Superconducting Ir_{1-x}Pd_{x}Te_{2} will be another excellent candidate for this geometry since its vertical coherence length is much larger than that of NbSe_{2} (\xi\sim 3 nm). The heterostructure of TI/Ir_{1-x}Pd_{x}Te can be a good candidate for exploring topological superconductor related phenomena in the future.

  smaller when the magnetic field is applied in the _ab_ plane. Nevertheless, the upper critical fields obtained in STS are well consistent with macroscopic bulk measurements as shown in Fig. 3(d). Superconducting vortex was observed by STS mapping. Figure 4(d) shows the vortex with nice close-packed arrangement. From the size of the vortex, as shown in Fig. 4(e), the in plane coherence length \xi (T=0.4 K) of \sim51 \pm 5 nm is obtained from the fitting of the line profile [red line in Fig. 4(d)] of the vortex, which is nearly consistent with the value from the bulk magnetic measurement. Small BCS ratio, _s_-wave-like gap function and long coherence length suggest that Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} is a fully gapped and weak coupling BCS-type _s_-wave superconductor. In addition, we carefully checked the STS at different positions of vortex as shown in Fig. 4(f). The red curve in Fig. 4(f) is collected right at the center of a vortex. Outside the vortex, there is a superconducting gap and the gap closes at the center of the vortex. Under our experimental temperature (0.4 K), no sign of zero bias conductance peak was observed at any position of vortex, which means even if there will be nontrivial superconducting states, much lower temperature is needed. From the STS measurement, we think we can rule out the possibility of a topological superconducting state in this system at 0.4 K.

Finally, the electronic structures of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} are studied by ARPES. Same as IrTe_{2}, the energy bands of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} show strong _k_{z}_ dispersion. By tuning incident photon energy, we can change the detectable momentum along the normal direction (_k_{z}_). In-plane FS at different _k_{z}_ was obtained by integrating the spectra weight with an energy window of 15 meV at Fermi energy. Changing of FS topology was observed in previous studies in IrTe_{2} below and above the phase transition temperature [23,25]. Figure 5(a) shows the FS of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} measured at 30 K overlaid with the room temperature FS (green and blue dotted lines) of IrTe_{2} from Ref. [23] at the exact same _k_{z}_ (\sim 0.8\pi) point using 90 eV photon energy. Clearly, after Pd substitution, the FS of superconducting samples at low temperature is the same as that of IrTe_{2} at room temperature. There is one outer big FS, three small Fermi pockets, and a tiny Fermi pocket around zone center. Meanwhile, the three small Fermi pockets [blue dotted lines in Fig. 5(a)] disappear at 30 K in IrTe_{2} samples [23]. Figures 5(c) and 5(d) show energy bands along the direction indicated by the yellow dotted lines in Fig. 5(a). Known from the band mapping, all the FSs are formed by holelike bands. Since Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} has no phase transition but has identical FS as that of the IrTe_{2} sample above phase transition temperature, it implies that itinerant origins such as FS nesting or saddle point nesting may not play key roles for the phase transition in this system. Phase transition is more likely related to local phenomena. For example, the depolymerization-polymerization of Te bonds was proposed to be involved in the phase transition [26]. And it was also proposed that Ir Sd orbital reconstruction governed the charge and orbital instability in IrTe_{2}[19]. In addition, charge modulation originated from the periodic dimerization of Te atoms was observed in previous STM experiments [27]. Figure 5(b) presents the FS near \pi point. At this _k_{z}_ point, the saddle point (marked as "S" in the figure) observed in IrTe_{2}[23] remains in Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2}, which leaves the possibility that the superconducting instability can be related to the van Hove singularity at saddle points [23]. This scenario could be studied by ultralow temperature ARPES experiments in the future.

In summary, we did comprehensive studies of the superconducting properties and electronic structures of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2}. By combination of the macroscopic and microscopic measurements, the superconducting gap size, coherence length, and electronics structures as well as the vortex states were determined. At 0.4 K, the samples present a BCS-type _s_-wave-like superconducting behavior. Though no exotic superconducting state was found in this system, the hexagonal lattice structure of Ir_{0.95}Pd_{0.05}Te_{2} is very suitable for epitaxial growth of TIs. In our previous work, Bi_{2}Se_{3} (Bi_{2}Te_{3}) TI films were successfully grown on _s_-wave superconductor NbSe_{2}[28,29]. This type of heterostructure utilizing the superconducting proximity effect perpendicular to the _ab_ plane is called vertical geometry. Superconducting Ir_{1-x}Pd_{x}Te_{2} will be another excellent candidate for this geometry since its vertical coherence length is much larger than that of NbSe_{2} (\xi\sim 3 nm). The heterostructure of TI/Ir_{1-x}Pd_{x}Te can be a good candidate for exploring topological superconductor related phenomena in the future.
