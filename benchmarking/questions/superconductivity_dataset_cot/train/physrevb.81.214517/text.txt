\({}^{2}\)January 201029 January  lar pieces for measurements of electrical resistivity, which was carried out using a standard four-probe technique in the temperature range from 1.8 to 20 K. Magnetization measurement were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system) in the temperature range from 2 to 300 K. Specific heat measurements were carried out by the adiabatic heat relaxation method in the temperature range from 2 to 30 K using the physical property measurement system (Quantum Design).

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of normalized electrical resistivity \(\rho(T)/\rho(20)\) for Dy1-xTm3Ni2B2C (_x_ = 0-1) system from 2 to 20 K. For the samples with \(x\) = 0.15 and 0.20, the presently studied temperature seems not sufficiently low enough to make the resistivity zero but the observed significant drop of resistivity in the low-temperature region is most likely due to superconductivity. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of low-field dc magnetization (_H_ = 3 mT) for Dy1-xTm3Ni2B2C (_x_ = 0-1) system from 2 to 20 K. For the superconducting samples, the low-field dc magnetization becoming negative or a significant drop was found near _T_c. The clear \(l\) shape behavior for some samples show the antiferromagnetic transition. A clear change in the slope of \(\rho(T)\) curves (Fig. 1) was also observed in the vicinity of the magnetic transition temperature. Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat \(C\) for Dy1-xTm3Ni2B2C (_x_ = 0-1) system. The large peaks of \(C\) are ascribed to the contributions from the magnetic transitions. The peak heights decrease and their position shift toward lower \(T\) with increasing \(x\). The contributions of the superconducting transitions to \(C\) seem too small to be seen except for \(x\) = 0.9 and 1.0. The superconducting transition temperature _T_c and magnetic transition temperature _T_N as a function of \(x\) and the dGdeff factor (which was calculated using dGdeff=(1-_x_) x dGd[Dy]+_x_ x dGd[Tm]) for Dy1-xTm3Ni2B2C (_x_ = 0-1) system are shown in Fig. 4. We can note that _T_c decreases rapidly with increasing \(x\) and shows a minimum around \(x\) = 0.15 (dG factor ~6.2), then increases gradually with a further increase in \(x\), i.e., a totally break down of dG scaling. The magnetic transition temperature _T_N deduced from _C_(_T_) curves was consistent with that from low-field _M_(_T_) curves, and _T_N gradually decreases with decreasing dG factor (increases in _x_), i.e., it can be well scaled by the dG factor. Moreover, there is no obvious change at the cross point of _T_c and _T_N.

The temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibility 1/_kh_ at an external field of 1 T for Dy1-xTm3Ni2B2C (_x_ = 0-1) system is shown in Fig. 5. The reciprocal susceptibility in high-temperature region could be well described by the Curie-Weiss law, i.e.,

  \[\chi = C/(T - \theta_{\rm p}),\]

where \(C\) is the curie constant and _th_p is the paramagnetic Curie constant. The effective magnetic moment _m_eff deduced from the Curie-Weiss law as a function of \(x\) in Dy1-xTm_nNi2B2C system is shown in Fig. 6. The value of _m_eff gradually decreases with increasing \(x\). The estimated values of _m_eff for the DyNi2B2C and TmNi2B2C are 10.29_m_B and 7.33_m_B, which are close to the values of free ions; Dy3+ (10.63_m_B) and Tm3+ (7.55_m_B), respectively. Indeed, the experimental derived values of _m_eff are consistent with those of theoretical calculated (as shown in Fig. 6) by the following equation:25

\[\begin{equation*}[\mu_{\rm eff}({\rm Dy}_{1-x}{\rm Tm}_{x}{\rm Ni}_{2}{\rm B}_{2}C)]^{2}\\ =x\times[\mu_{\rm eff}({\rm Dy}^{3+})]^{2}+(1-x)\times[\mu_{\rm eff}({\rm Tm}^{3+})]^{2}.\end{equation*}\]

This results indicates that the electronic structures of Dy3+ and Tm3+ ions in the ground state do not have a pronounce change in the entire Dy1-xTm3Ni2B2C system. The temperature dependence of high-field magnetic susceptibility at a field of 1 T (higher than _H_e2) for Dy1-xTm3Ni2B2C (_x_ = 0- 1) system is also shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The magnetic susceptibility shows a weak temperature dependence at low temperatures for \(x\) = 0.2-0.6, i.e., a ferrimagneticlike behavior emerged. The magnetic field dependence of magnetization for Dy1-xTm3Ni2B2C (_x_ = 0- 1) system at 2 K up to 7 T was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The results of samples for \(x\) = 0 and 0.1 are consistent with those of previously reported by Li and Nishimura.24 The magneti

  zation tends to be saturated at high field which is similar to those in the Y or Lu substituted DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system.[20; 21; 26] Morozov[27] theoretically predicated that similarly as in the spin-triplet paired superconductors, nonmagnetic impurity in an antiferromagnetic superconductor cause pair breaking. Morozov[28] also theoretically studied the reentrant behavior of HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C in the temperature region 5\(<\)\(T\)\(<\)6 K, and concluded that the modification of the wave functions of conduction electrons by the long-range magnetic order due to the paramagnetic phase is the main reason for the abrupt suppression of superconductivity. Nass _et al.[29]_ also theoretically studied the impurity effect on superconductivity. They concluded that in some magnetic superconductors, nonmagnetic impurities may suppress \(T_{\rm c}\) owing to the destruction of the translational symmetry of the antiferromagnetic lattice. In the present Tm-substituted system and our previously reported Lu-substituted DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system,[16] the observed ferrimagneticlike magnetic order at a certain substitution content can be a main reason for the suppression of superconductivity. The observed ferrimagneticlike behavior is possibly due to some spin fluctuation caused by the disorder and inhomogeneity that was induced by Tm substitution. These behaviors were similar to Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Lu\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system.[16]

It has been also demonstrated that for pseudouqaternary Dy\({}_{1-x}\)R\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (_R_ = Ho, Tb, Y, and Lu) systems the dG scaling of \(T_{\rm c}\) or/and \(T_{\rm N}\) breaks down entirely. For example, in the Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system,[18]\(T_{\rm c}\) was almost constant in the region of \(T_{\rm c}\)\(<\)\(T_{\rm N}\). An almost unchanged \(T_{\rm N}\) was found in the Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Tb\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system for \(x\)\(<\) 0.6.[19] The rapid suppression of superconductivity in nonmagnetic Y or Lu diluted DyNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C systems was also observed.[16; 20; 21; 22; 23] To further understand the Dy site substitution effect, the variations in \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(T_{\rm N}\) versus doping content \(x\) and dG\({}_{\rm eff}\) factor in Dy\({}_{1-x}\)R\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (_R_ = Ho, Tb, Tm, and Lu) system are presented in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.

To thoroughly understand the change in \(T_{\rm c}\), we divide the substitution range into two regions where superconductivity show a minimum (\(x\)\(\sim\) 0.15, 0.15, 0.4, and 0.7 for \(R\) = Lu, Tm, Tb, and Ho, respectively) and discuss them separately. From Fig. 8, for the low doping content, \(T_{\rm c}\) almost linearly decreases with increasing \(R\) content \(x\), and the suppression rate of \(T_{\rm c}\) on \(x\), \(\sigma\)T\({}_{\rm c}\)/\(\alpha\), is -37, -26, -12, and \(\sim\)0 K for \(R\) = Lu, Tm, Tb, and Ho, respectively. According to the AG theory,[17] the magnetic pair-breaking effect is due to the exchange scattering by uncorrelated local magnetic spins, and the suppression of superconductivity can be characterized by

\[\partial T_{\rm c}/\partial x\sim J_{\rm sf}^{2}\times{\rm dG},\] (3)

where \(x\) is the concentration of magnetic moment and \(J_{\rm sf}\) is an exchange coupling constant between the local moments and the conduction electrons. From Fig. 9, for Dy\({}_{1-x}\)R\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system at low doping content (corresponding dG\({}_{\rm eff}\) in the range of 6-8 in Fig. 9), \(T_{\rm c}\) decreases with increasing dG\({}_{\rm eff}\) for \(R\) = Tb as is predicated by AG theory. However, \(T_{\rm c}\) increases with the increases in dG\({}_{\rm eff}\) for \(R\) = Lu and Tm, which is contradict with AG theory. The almost unchanged in \(T_{\rm c}\) for \(R\) = Ho also cannot be understood with this theory. Doh _et al.[30]_ proposed a phenomenological model which includes two magnetic and two superconducting order parameters (SOPs) accounting for the multiband structure in _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system, and the pair-breaking effect in Dy\({}_{1-x}\)Ho\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system was well explained. Based on this model, the dominant one of the SOPs was due to the Ni band, and the other SOP was due to the other bands. In a paramagnetic state, both SOPs are suppressed as dG\({}_{\rm eff}\) increases. However, in a magnetically ordered state, the SOP from the Ni band is affected by the local field due to the field cancellation effect at the Ni site because geometrically, Ni is thought to be located at the center of the tetrahedron of four nearest rare-earth ions in the Dy\({}_{1-x}\)R\({}_{x}\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system. The band originating from Ni does not feel the magnetic moment of Dy(Ho) anymore below the Neel temperature since it is located exactly in the center of a tetrahedron of the nearest Dy(Ho) atoms. This is the reason why \(T_{\rm c}\) almost unchanged below \(T_{\rm N}\). This behavior was also experimentally verified in a Mossbauer study.[31] Therefore, with the substitution of

  other \(R\)3+ at Dy3+ site, the field cancellation effect will modify the wave functions of conduction electrons by the long-range magnetic order in Dy1-_R_NiiB2C system.[4, 5] The observed ferrimagneticlike magnetic order in Tm- and Lu-substituted DyNi2B2C systems properly reflected the field cancellation effect by the random doping at Dy site. The strength can be simply estimated from the difference in magnetic properties, including the magnetic moment and the magnetic ordering wave vector, of _R_NiiB2C from the mother compound DyNi2B2C. The AG theory is still valid as well if we consider the above points and assume the difference in magnetic properties as |DdGdeff|, i.e., for a magnetic ordered superconductor, Eq. (3) can be modified as

\[\begin{equation*}{\partial}T_{c}/{\partial}x{\times}-I_{sf}^{2}{\times}{\mid}{ \Delta}{\rm d}{\rm G}_{\rm eff}{\mid}-J_{sf}^{2}{\times}{\times}{\rm d}{\rm G}_{\rm eff}\end{equation*}\] (4)

in which _Ist_ is the exchange coupling constant between the Ni(3_d_) electrons and the effective magnetic cancellation field. The magnetic structure of DyNi2B2C and HoNi2B2C consist of ferromagnetically aligned Dy(Ho) spins in the _ab_ plane but antiferromagnetically coupled along the \(c\) axis.[14, 20] For the TbNi2B2C, the magnetic spins points along the \(a\) axis and form an _a_-axis-modulated order structure.[8] The antiferromagnetic ground state of TmNi2B2C consists of ferromagnetic planes along the \(c\) axis, sinusoidally modulated along the (110) direction.[32] The values of dG factor are 1.17, 4.5, 7.1, and 10.5 for Tm3+, Ho3+, Dy3+, and Tb3+, respectively, and _T_N increases in this order. For the nonmagnetic Lu3+ is a magnetic spin vacancy, the values of dG factor will be 0, therefore, Lu3+ ion will act as the stronger pair breaker than the other magnetic ordered \(R\)3+ ions. As a matter of fact, the suppression rate \({\partial}T_{c}/{\partial}x\) for _R_=Lu, Tm, Tb, and Ho is well consistent with the predicted. From Fig. 9, at low doping content (dGeff in the range of 6-8), we can note that the absolute value of suppression rate of _T_c on dGdeff, |\({\partial}T_{c}/{\partial}{\rm d}{\rm G}_{\rm eff}\)|, does not show too much difference for _R_=Lu, Tm, and Tb. That is, the pair-breaking effect in DyNi2B2C mainly depends on the field cancellation effect at the Ni site, it is not directly related to the magnetic moment of the dopant ions at least for _R_=Lu, Tm, and Tb in Dy1-_R_NiiB2C system.

For the higher doping region (_x_ > 0.3, 0.15, and 0.75 for _R_=Lu, Tm, and Ho, respectively), the behavior of superconductivity is easily understood. The decreases in _T_c with increasing Dy content (1-_x_) is due to the magnetic pair-breaking effect when the rare-earth ions are replaced by the magnetic Dy ions for _R_Ni2B2C (_R_=Lu, Tm, and Ho), as predicted by the AG theory.[14, 17] However, the \({\partial}T_{c}/{\partial}{\rm d}{\rm G}_{\rm eff}\) versus dG factor for these compounds (in Fig. 9) seems not to show a universal behavior which was different from the AG theory prediction. This behavior originated from different crystalline electric field (CEF) effects of \(R\)3+ and different values of conduction-electron-local-moment coupling constant.[9, 22] From Fig. 9, in the range of dGdeff~3~6 and 4.5-5 for _R_=Tm and Ho, respectively, the value of \({\partial}T_{c}/{\partial}{\rm d}{\rm G}_{\rm eff}\) for _R_=Tm and Ho is almost the same as _R_=Lu (dGeff~0~-5) which possibly suggests that CEF of Dy3+ plays dominant role at these regions.

From Figs. 8 and 9, we can note that both \(x\) and dGeff dependence of _T_N in Dy1-_TmNi2B2C show a linear behavior. However, the _T_N does not follow the dG scaling in Dy1-_T_NiiB2C (Ref. [19]) and Er1-_T_NiiB2C (Ref. [33]) systems because the two mother compounds have different magnetic ordering structure. These ground states of the two mother compounds will compete with each other and this competition or the change in magnetic structures can result in a breakdown of dG scaling. The present TmNi2B2C and DyNi2B2C have different magnetic structures but the _T_N of TmNi2B2C (1.5 K) is much lower than that in DyNi2B2C (10.6 K), i.e., the magnetic exchange interactions of Tm moments are smaller than those of Dy moments. The breakdown of dG scaling in Dy1-_TmNi2B2C, therefore, is expected to be observed at very small amount of Dy content region (no data in present study). The linear dependence on \(x\) and dGeff of _T_N in Dy1-_R_NiiB2C (_R_=Lu and Ho) can reflect the same magnetic structure in the whole doping range in these compounds.

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we have systematically studied the superconductivity and magnetism of Dy1-_Tm_NiiB2C (_x_ = 0-1) compounds. For lower doping region (_x_ < 0.2), the superconducting transition temperature _T_c decreases rapidly with increasing Tm content \(x\) and shows a minimum around \(x\) =0.15, which is mainly due to the field cancel effect at Ni sites. For the higher doping region (_x_ \(\equiv\) 0.2), _T_c decreases gradually with a further increases in Dy content 1-_x_ (increases with Tm content _x_), which is due to the magnetic pair-breaking effect when the Tm ions are replaced by the magnetic Dy ions. The magnetic transition temperature _T_M and the effective magnetic moment gradually decreases with increases \(x\). From a comparison study of \(x\) and dGeff dependences of _T_c and _T_N in Dy1-_R_NiiB2C (_R_=Ho, Tb, Tm, and Lu) systems, based on the AG theory[17] and the phenomenological model proposed by Doh _et al._,[30] we presented an explanation that could account for the superconductivity and the magnetism of the magnetic ordered superconductors Dy1-_R_NiiB2C systems. We can conclude that the pair-breaking effect in DyNi2B2C does not directly relate to the magnetic moment of the dopant ions, it mainly depends on the field cancellation effect at the Ni site at least for Dy1-_R_NiiB2C (_R_=Lu, Tm, and Tb) systems. The relation between _T_N and dGeff (following or breaking dG scaling) mainly depends on the magnetic structure in the ground state of the mother compound.
