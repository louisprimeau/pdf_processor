Based on the composition analysis by ICP (see Table 1) for the crystals grown from different starting compositions, we can see that as the content of K was increased from 0.8 to 1.0, the iron content in the obtained single crystals systemically decreased from 1.6 to 1.5 and the superconductivity finally disappeared. This indicates that a high deficiency of Fe has a major detrimental effect on transport properties.

Second, we systematically changed the concentrations of Fe ions with K fixed to study the transport behavior. Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) crystals between 2 and 300 K. It is obvious that the behavior of the electrical transport has changed with the increase of Fe concentrations (corresponding to the decrease of Fe deficiency.) When the Fe deficiency is large, the resistivity curve possesses an obvious metal-insulator (MI) transition at around 140 K. At high temperatures, the sample shows semiconductor-like behaviors, while below the transition temperature, it presents a metallic behavior.[5] With increasing Fe concentration, the hump diminishes gradually, its position shifts to high temperature, and finally it vanishes in the sample with chemical composition K0.82Fe1.63Se2. Here, the electrical resistivity exhibits a perfectly metallic behavior. However, the superconducting critical temperature \(T_{c}\) increases slightly (less than 0.8 K) with decreasing Fe deficiency. We note that there is not any anomaly in the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility, and there is also no structural phase transition occurring over the temperature range from 60 to 300 K.[6] The semiconductor-like-metal-like transition may be attributed to the ordering process of the cation vacancies in the nonstoichiometric compound of K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\), and it significantly influences the electrical resistivity. The similar issues concerning order-disorder phenomena have been discussed in the transition metal carbides and the high-\(T_{c}\) compounds, where the ordering of the vacancies play an important role in controlling the normal-state resistivity and superconductivity.[7, 8] Interestingly, the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity under high pressure has been investigated by Guo _et al._,[6] where the hump was successively suppressed by applying pressure, and the superconductivity was destroyed simultaneously, in contrast to the results of our study. There is no obvious correlation between the superconducting critical temperature and the broad hump.

Figure 3(a) presents the magnetic susceptibility as a function of the temperature from 3 to 35 K for the sample with chemical composition K0.82Fe1.63Se2 under the magnetic field of 10 Oe. The zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) susceptibility both show sharp transitions at around 32 K. From the ZFC, it can be estimated that the superconducting volume fraction at 10 K is about 100%, which demonstrates the bulk superconductivity in the samples. The inset of Fig. 3(a) shows the typical resistivity curve of K0.82Fe1.63Se2, which clearly shows the metallic behavior with a high residual resistivity ratio (\(R_{300\text{ K}}/R_{35\text{ K}}\approx 42\)).

Figures 3(b) and 3(c) show the behavior of resistivity of K0.82Fe1.63Se2 in an external magnetic field up to 12 T. In Fig. 3(b), the applied field is within the \(ab\) plane (\(H\|ab\)) while in Fig. 3(c), the applied field is parallel to the \(c\) axis (\(H\|c\)). We see the superconducting transition is suppressed in both conditions, but the effect of the magnetic field is much larger when the field is applied along the \(c\) axis of the single crystals instead of within the \(ab\) plane. The corresponding upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) as a function of temperature obtained from a determination of the midpoint of the resistive transition is plotted in Fig. 3(d). The curves are steep with slopes \(-dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}=7.20\) T/K for \(H\|ab\) and \(-dH_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}=2.17\) T/K for \(H\|c\). According to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula,[9]\(H_{c2}(0)=-0.69(dH_{c2}/dT)T_{c}\) and taking 32 K as \(T_{c}\), the upper critical fields are estimated to be \(H_{c2}^{\text{ab}}=159\) T and \(H_{c2}^{\text{c}}=48\) T. The ratio of \(H_{c2}^{\text{ab}}/H_{c2}^{\text{c}}\) is about 3.3, which is consistent with previous reports.[10]

One issue we want to point out is that a trace of superconductivity with \(T_{c}\) up to 44 K has been observed in several batches of samples with nominal

  composition K0.8Fe2Se2. Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity in the low-temperature region. It is clear that there exist two transition steps on the resistivity curve measured under zero field, one at about 38 K and another at about 44 K. To verify whether the transition at 44 K is due to superconductivity, we measured the field dependence of resistivity and observed the resistivity curves change at around 44 K, and the kink shifts to low temperature with increasing magnetic fields. The fact that the transition at 44 K was suppressed slowly by applying the magnetic fields indicates the superconductivity is intrinsic. Magnetic susceptibility has also been measured on the same samples, and it is clearly shown in the Fig. 4(b) that once the temperature is lower than around 44 K, the magnetization begins to decrease and the rate of decrease greatly increases once the temperature is lower than 28 K, which corresponds to the transition temperature of zero resistivity. Hence, it raises one question: Where does the superconductivity come from, the K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) (122) phase with super-high quality or another phase? A detailed characterization of the superconducting phase is in progress.

In conclusion, we have successfully grown series of single crystals K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) with different Fe vacancies. A trace of superconductivity extending up to near 44 K was also observed in some K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) crystals, which has the highest \(T_{c}\) of the reported iron selenides. The anomalous semiconductor-like-metal-like transition is observed only in the sample with the high level of Fe vacancies. We speculate that the anomaly is associated with the ordering of the framework vacancies, which significantly influences the electrical resistivity. The more-ordered phase showing a large reduction in residual resistivity is due to the reduction of electron-vacancy scattering. A more detailed study is needed in order to better understand the correlation of superconductivity with the anomalous metal-insulator transition.
