###### Abstract

The growth of carbon-substituted magnesium diboride Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystals with 0 \leq x \approx 0.15 is reported, and the structural, transport, and magnetization data are presented. The superconducting transition temperature decreases monotonically with increasing carbon content in the full investigated range of substitution. By adjusting the nominal composition, T_{c} of substituted crystals can be tuned in a wide temperature range between 10 and 39 K. Simultaneous introduction of disorder by carbon substitution and significant increase of the upper critical field H_{c2} is observed. Comparing with the nonsubstituted compound, H_{c2} at 15 K for x =0.05 is enhanced by more than a factor of 2 for H oriented both perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane. This enhancement is accompanied by a reduction of the H_{c2}-anisotropy coefficient \gamma from 4.5 (for the nonsubstituted compound) to 3.4 and 2.8 for the crystals with x =0.05 and 0.095, respectively. At temperatures below 10 K, the single crystal with larger carbon content shows H_{c2} (defined at zero resistance) higher than 7 and 24 T for H oriented perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane, respectively. Observed increase of H_{c2} cannot be explained by the change in the coherence length due to the disorder-induced decrease of the mean free path only.

## I Introduction

For the possible large-scale applications of the MgB_{2} superconductor the upper critical field H_{c2} is a central materials parameter.^{1} For pure single crystals the out-of-plane H_{c2}^{\parallel}(0) is as low as 3.1 T (Ref. [2]) and, therefore, many efforts have been made to modify the superconducting properties of this material through chemical substitution. A brief review of the current status of the substitutional chemistry of MgB_{2} can be found in the paper by Cava _et al.^{3}_ Carbon substitution for boron appeared to be one of the most interesting, though the reported carbon solubility in MgB_{2} and its influence on T_{c} varies considerably depending on the synthesis route and starting materials.^{4-7} Carbon solubility ranging from 1.25% to 30% was reported^{4,6} when elemental magnesium, boron, and carbon were used as starting materials. Another approach for carbon substitution of MgB_{2} was suggested by Mickelson _et al.^{8}_ Using boron carbide (B_{4}C) as a source of carbon they achieved better mixing of B and C atoms. The samples had an estimated composition Mg(B_{0.9}C_{0.1})_{2}, and T_{c} was decreased by 7 K. Ribeiro _et al._ followed this approach and reported the optimization of synthetic conditions of carbon-doped samples leading to nearly single-phase Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} with T_{c}=22 K.^{9} A neutron diffraction study performed on their sample yielded a carbon substitution level of about 10%, and a linear relation between the unit cell parameter a and the C concentration was found.^{10} The authors showed that earlier reports overestimated the carbon content in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} because polycrystalline-carbon-substituted samples may contain significant amounts of impurity phases and the nominal content was assumed most often to be equal to the actual one. Refinement of neutron diffraction data performed on very carefully prepared polycrystalline samples showed that samples contain \sim73% of the Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} phase.^{10}

The improvement of flux pinning and the enhancement of the critical current density in MgB_{2} powder by both nanoparticle SiC (Ref. [11]) and nanocarbon doping^{12} was reported by Dou and co-workers. They claimed that simultaneous Si and C substitution for B raised the saturation limit of C in MgB_{2} considerably, while the T_{c} reduction is not pronounced (only 2.4 K for x =0.4). The shift of the irreversibility line towards higher fields and temperatures, caused by nanodiamond doping to MgB_{2}, was reported by Cheng _et al.^{13}_

Most of these substitutions involved polycrystalline samples. The availability of single crystals is expected to provide more detailed insight into the microscopic aspects of substitution, including the solubility limit and the T_{c} variation as a function of doping as well as the impact of disorder-induced defects on superconducting properties. Recently, several reports on carbon-substituted single crystals appeared. One of them presented shortly our results of the T_{c} dependence on carbon content.^{14} Lee _et al._ presented lattice parameters, magnetization and resistivity measurement data for MgB_{2} crystals with carbon content up to 15% (Ref. [15]). The data of the last report are in qualitative agreement with ours, presented here; however, quantitative differences exists. Lee _et al._ presented the nominal carbon content x in all of their plots and assumed that it is equal to the actual one; however, according to our experience the nominal carbon content for single crystals of Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} is different from the one calculated from the a lattice parameter dependence.

In the context of the recent discussions on the transport properties of MgB_{2} (Ref. [16]), it is of general interest to study the temperature dependence of the resistivity of single-phase compounds, where both the mean free path and the superconducting coherence length can vary considerably due to substitutions. Single crystals instead of polycrystalline materials are preferred to separate granularity effects from changes in the electron structure or the electron scattering process. Pure and aluminum-substituted MgB_{2} has been examined widely.[3, 17, 18, 19, 20] However, the carbon-substituted compounds have been studied only recently in both polycrystalline samples[21, 22] and single crystals.[15, 23, 24, 25] The value and anisotropy of the upper critical field H_{c2} for the Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x}) compounds have been reported in a limited range.[23, 24, 25] At 15 K, H_{c2} for optimally C-substituted MgB_{2} single crystals shows an increase by a factor of 2 for H applied parallel as well as perpendicular to the ab plane; however, this result depends somewhat on the H_{c2} definition.[26, 27, 28]

In this paper, we report the results of single-crystal growth, structure, resistivity, and magnetic property investigations of carbon-substituted MgB_{2}. We describe H_{c2} deduced from resistance measurements for both field configurations, for Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} crystals with x=0.05 and 0.095. Here, the critical temperature T_{c} at constant magnetic field is defined as a temperature where the nonzero-resistant state begins to develop in the zero-current limit. The introduction of disorder by carbon substitution increases H_{c2} as compared to that of MgB_{2}. However, the twofold increase of H_{c2} combined with the modest decrease of T_{c} by about 5 K cannot be explained by changes in the coherence length caused by the defect-induced decrease of the mean free path only.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} were grown under high pressure using a cubic anvil press. The applied pressure and temperature conditions for the growth of MgB_{2} single crystals were determined in our earlier study of the Mg-B-N phase diagram.[29] Magnesium (Fluka, >99% purity), amorphous boron (Alfa Aesar, >99.99%), carbon graphite powder (Alfa Aesar, >99.99%), and silicon carbide (Alfa Aesar, >99.8%) were used as starting materials. Amorphous boron was annealed under a dynamic vacuum at 1200 degC to minimize contamination by oxygen. Two types of precursors were prepared: in the first case, graphite served as a source of carbon; in the second type of precursors, SiC was added to a mixture of Mg and amorphous B. Starting materials with different nominal carbon content were mixed and pressed. A pellet was put into a BN container of 6 mm internal diameter and 8 mm length. Crystals were grown in the same way as the unsubstituted crystals. First, pressure was applied using a pyrophylite pressure transmitting cube as a medium; then, the temperature was increased during 1 h, up to the maximum of 1900-1950 degC, kept for 30 min, and decreased over 1-2 h.

The single-crystal x-ray diffraction investigations were carried out using two four-circle x-ray diffractometers (Siemens P4 and CAD4). The refinement of the crystal structure was made with the jana2000 program package.[30] Electrical resistivity measurements were performed with a 14-T Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS). Small single crystals were selected (typically with dimensions of 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.04 mm^{3}) to reduce any influence of crystal imperfections. The measuring current density was i =2.5 A/cm^{2}, to study the upper critical field properties, and varied from 0.25 to 40 A/cm^{2}, to examine the vortex dynamics, including I-V characteristics. The measurement current flowed in the ab plane and was perpendicular to the applied field. The field was oriented both parallel and perpendicular to the ab plane, which is the main plane of the MgB_{2} single crystal. Magnetic measurements have been performed with a noncommercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The temperature dependence of the dc magnetization in an external magnetic fields of H =1 -3 Oe was recorded for both zero-field-cooled and field-cooled conditions. Torque measurements were performed in a 9-T Quantum Design PPMS.

## III Results

### Crystal growth

Carbon-substituted Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} crystals were grown with dimensions up to 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.02 mm^{3}. They were black in color in contrast to golden nonsubstituted MgB_{2}. Table I presents the starting composition, estimated carbon content, and lattice parameters as well as the superconducting transition temperature of unsubstituted and carbon-substituted MgB_{2} single crystals. Energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis and laser ablation inductive coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectroscopy analyses performed on the SiC-doped crystals show only C and no traces of Si in the crystals. X-ray single-crystal analysis confirmed this finding (see next section). The carbon content in the crystals was estimated from the a lattice parameter, assuming the linear dependence of the a parameter on carbon content, according to Ref. [10]. Although it is a rough approximation, no other proof of carbon content was found and the x-ray refinement was not possible because of similar scattering factors for B and C. The variation of T_{c} as a function of lattice parameter a and carbon concentration is presented in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) together with the temperature dependence of magnetization curves [inset to Fig. 1(b)]. The superconducting transitions are relatively sharp even in highly doped crystals. With increasing C content, T_{c} decreases smoothly, and we note a more effective suppression of T_{c} when the C level exceeds ~10% (Fig. 1). By adjusting the carbon content in the starting mixture one can tune T_{c} in a wide range (39-10 K) for carbon content between x=0 and 0.15.

### Single-crystal structure analysis

Three single crystals MgB_{2}, Mg(B_{0.896}C_{0.104})_{2}, and Mg(B_{0.880}C_{0.150})_{2} were used for detailed structure analysis. The changes in the structures were expected to be minor, and therefore all experiments were handled under the same conditions. Pure MgB_{2} was refined for comparison. Cell parameters for all of the crystals were refined from one and the same set of 23 reflections in a wide range of \theta angles. No superstructure reflections were found; thus, we conclude a statistical distribution of carbon or silicon on the B site. A  preliminary study of reflection profiles revealed a highly anisotropic broadening for the substituted crystals. The two-dimensional profiles of reflections for Mg(B0.895C0.150)2 show the elongation of the reflections along the _c_deg direction in reciprocal space [Fig. 2(a)], while in the _adegb_deg plane the reflection profiles [Fig. 2(b)] are similar to those of the un-substituted phase. For Mg(B0.896C0.104)2 the elongation is smaller. In pure MgB2 the reflection profiles are the same in all directions of reciprocal space. The anisotropy of the reflections in carbon-substituted crystals indicates crystal disorder, but the structural investigations alone cannot identify the type of disorder. Microscopic phase separation suggested by Maurin _et al._7 should rather result in a number of discrete reflections, quite close to each other or partially overlapping, but local inhomogeneities of the carbon distribution in crystals may be one of the possible reasons for the broadening of reflections. The description and results of the single-crystal experiments are given in Table 2.

As was already mentioned, the carbon content at the B site for Mg(B1-Cs)2 was estimated from the a lattice parameter according to Ref. [10]. Boron and carbon contents were fixed throughout the entire refinement. The laser ablation ICP mass spectrometry analysis showed no silicon in the substituted crystals, prepared with SiC as a source of carbon. The refinement of Si content in the second crystal converged to zero. Thus, it was assumed that silicon was not present in crystals and was not considered in the final refinement.

First, Mg(B1-Cs)2 structures were refined in an isotropic approximation with R factors increasing from 0.028 to 0.052 for increasing x. Isotropic extinction refinement reduced the R factors by 0.004-0.01 with a significance level of extinction parameters not less than 3s (_s_ is the standard deviation). Successively, magnesium occupancy, anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (ADP), and anharmonic ADP were added to the refinements. The results of each step are given in Table 3. The refinement of pure MgB2 converged to low R factors without any peculiarities. The refinement of the Mg occupancy differed from unity within 1.5s and was fixed to unity in the final refinement. It is not the case for the substituted crystals. R factors and residual peaks at difference Fourier maps were significantly higher at each step compared to that of the unsubstituted phase, which means that there are some local distortions compared to the parent structure. The refinement of anisotropic or anharmonic ADP did not improve residual factors significantly or no improvement was observed. In the case of refinement of the anharmonic ADP the probability density function (PDF) for Mg produced strong negative regions and this approximation was rejected in the final refinement. Finally the Mg occupancy was refined for both substituted phases. It resulted in significant improvement of R factors and the 1.5-2 times decrease of residual peaks at the difference Fourier maps. Positional and atomic displacement parameters for each structure are given in Table 4.

The refinement showed Mg deficiency, increasing with increasing carbon content from the 0% for unsubstituted samples to about 10% for the C-substituted samples with the highest carbon amount of x = 0.15. The attempt of a direct determination of the ratio of Mg content to B and C content in Mg(B1-Cs)2 single crystals by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was not successful because of difficulties with proper determination of the carbon content. Nevertheless, incomplete EPMA data indicate much smaller if any magnesium deficiency as compared to that estimated by x-ray refinement.

A large increase of anisotropic ADP for all atoms with increasing x was observed. This fact suggests static disorder for both sites. Such disorder should lead to a shortening of Mg-C distances. In the structure of MgB2C2 (Ref. [31]) Mg-C distances vary in the range 2.25-2.52 A and similar variations may be expected in the substituted phases as well. It may be the reason for underestimation of magnesium occupancy, because Mg atoms may be shifted from an ideal deviation to create asymmetric coordination in unit cells where carbon atoms are present. Small positive residual peaks were observed 0.6-0.8 A from Mg and about 1.8-2.3 A from the B(C) site, which corresponds to interatomic distances in the structure mentioned above. Besides, in spite of careful experiments and refinements, R factors for substituted phases remained quite high compared to that of pure MgB2. Thus, it may be suggested that local disorder is present in structures  of substituted crystals, which cannot be described in conventional terms.

### Superconducting properties

Field-cooled magnetization of carbon-substituted MgB_{2} was found to be significantly lower in comparison with that of an unsubstituted compound recorded at the same magnetic field (see Fig. 3). It provides an indication of increased pinning, most likely due to the local disorder introduced by the carbon substitution, in agreement with the results of x-ray investigations. The small value of the ratio of field-cooled to zero-field-cooled magnetization accompanied by a narrow transition width may also indicate the inhomogenous carbon distribution on a length scale of the distribution of carbon inhomogeneities below the coherence length \xi value rather than on the microscopic phase separation. If C were inhomogeneously distributed on a length scale larger than \xi, the magnetization versus temperature should show several steps or a broad transition.

Figure 4 shows the normalized in-plane resistance versus temperature for the Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystals with x =0,0.05, and 0.095. For the nonsubstituted sample, "the residual resistance ratio" RRR \equiv 7 [defined as R(300 K)/R(40 K)] is similar or larger than reported in the literature.[16, 28, 32, 33] This indicates a good quality of the single crystals. The nonlinear increase of the normalized resistance R(40 K)/R(300 K) with carbon substitution is observed and

The reflection of the C-substituted MgB_{2} crystal shows an elongation in the c^{*} direction. (b) \omega-\theta scan of 300 reflections of Mg(B_{0.85}C_{0.15})_{2}:c^{*} is perpendicular to the plane, a^{*}b^{*} is parallel to the plane, and a^{*} is parallel to the reflection; the contour at 0 (dashed line), 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, then contour step 200 sec^{-1}. The shape of the reflections is similar to that of the unsubstituted MgB_{2} crystal.

  this may result in a saturation effect. Such a saturation of R(40)/R(300) suggests that some changes in the transport properties of the substituted MgB_{2} single crystals cannot be explained by any simple model considering the reduction in the cross-section area of the sample as a main reason of the observed effects.[16] Most likely, the carbon substitution results in the creation of more microscopic than macroscopic defects acting as electron scattering centers. This is consistent with the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results, shown in Fig. 5, where no carbon agglomerates or other extended structure defects have been observed. The appearance of microscopic scattering centers should result in a shorter mean free path and, as a consequence, in a decrease of the superconducting coherence length \xi. This should increase H_{c2}, as being actually observed for the C-substituted crystals.

The in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} for the substituted Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystal with x=0.05 is shown in Fig. 6. Despite the low RRR \equiv 2, the crystal exhibits relatively low \rho_{ab}(300 K) = 20 \mu\Omega cm if compared even with metallic copper [\rho(300 K \equiv 1.5 \mu\Omega cm, RRR \equiv 20-2000]. This feature seems to confirm the rather unusual transport properties of MgB_{2}, as discussed by Rowell.[16] For the sample with x =0.05 ,\rho_{ab} in the magnetic field H perpendicular to the ab plane is presented in the inset of Fig. 6. A sharp transition to the superconducting state is observed at zero field (\Delta T_{c} =0.05 K) and this transition widens in higher fields. For \mu_{0}H=2 and 3 T, a two-step-like behavior in \rho_{ab}(T) is observed at T_{c}, where a sharp drop at lower temperatures may be explained as a result of a vortex melting effect. The shape and temperature of the superconducting transition do not change significantly when the current density i=2.5 A/cm^{2}

At higher current densities, the vortex-driven state is observed with a peak effect that develops at moderate fields. Similar effects have been reported for the nonsubstituted MgB_{2} single crystals.[26] The differences in the resistivity of the single crystals with x =0.05 and 0.095 and for two field configurations (H perpendicular or parallel to the ab plane) seem to be caused mainly by the differences in the pinning force only. Generally, much sharper transitions are observed for the sample with x =0.095 and for the configuration where H is parallel to the ab plane. Detailed studies of the vortex dynamics in the driven state are being performed and will be published separately.

The upper critical fields are derived from the transport measurements, applying two definitions of the transition temperature. First, T_{\rm on} is determined by the linear extrapola

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} Parameter & MgB_{2} & MgB_{0.91} & MgB_{0.9} \\ (B_{0.896}C_{0.10\AA}) & (B_{0.850}C_{0.150}) \\ \hline _Occupation_, Mg & 1 & 0.910(11) & 0.891(14) \\ x, Mg & & 0 & \\ y, Mg & & 0 & \\ z, Mg & & 0 & \\ x, B/C & & 1/3 & \\ y, B/C & & 2/3 & \\ z, B/C & & 1/2 & \\ 10^{3}U_{11}, Mg & 4.95(17) & 8.54(18) & 11.3(3) \\ 10^{3}U_{33}, Mg & 5.81(18) & 9.05(19) & 12.4(4) \\ 10^{3}U_{12}, Mg & (10  tion of _R_(_T_) to the normal-state resistance from the first sudden drop observed at the transition. Second, T_{c} is defined as a temperature of the linear extrapolation of _R_(_T_) (from the similar transition area) to the zero resistance state. This definition of T_{c} corresponds to a temperature where R drops to zero for a current density small enough to significantly reduce or, depending on H, even avoid effects related to the vortex driven state. Thus, _T_on and T_{c} are the temperatures corresponding to the upper critical field and the irreversibility field, respectively.[23, 34] However, for H perpendicular to the _ab_ plane and in a case when those critical temperatures differ much one from another, _T_on seems to be influenced by surface effects and, therefore, _H__c_2 is determined more adequate if being associated with T_{c} (Ref. [26]). This definition of _H__c_2 is consistent with bulk measurements of the magnetization,[26]; specific heat,[27] and thermal conductivity.[35]

The upper critical fields of the Mg(B1-C)x)2 single crystals are shown in Fig. 7 for H parallel (H_{c2}^{i\omega}) and perpendicular (H_{c2}^{i\omega}) to the _ab_ plane. At 20 K, an anisotropy \gamma =(H_{c2}^{i\omega}/H_{c2}^{i\omega})2 =3.4 and 2.8 is measured for the crystals with x = 0.05 and 0.095, respectively. The observed decrease of the anisotropy from \gamma(20 K) \equiv 4.2-4.5, measured in the nonsubstituted MgB2 (Refs. [26, 28, 32, 36]) to \gamma(20 K) \equiv 2.8 reflects the general reduction of the electronic anisotropy due to substitution. A small anisotropy \gamma(20 K) \equiv 2.5 has been reported for a Mg(B1-C)2 single crystal with x = 0.02, where _H__c_2 was measured by local ac susceptibility.[24] It is difficult to comment on this result because a large uncertainty in the determination of the carbon content appears in single crystals grown under different conditions. It is known that the real carbon content differs much from the nominal content, as shown by neutron diffraction experiments.[10]

Superior properties of the single crystal with x = 0.095 manifest themselves at temperatures below 10 K (see Fig. 7). At these temperatures, H_{c2}^{i\omega} for this crystal is larger than H_{c2}^{i\omega} derived for the less substituted sample with x = 0.05. For H parallel to the _ab_ plane, crossing of the H_{c2}^{i\omega}(_T_) dependences obtained for both single crystals is predicted at 10 K by linear extrapolation of H_{c2}^{i\omega}(_T_) from 20 and 17 K for the crystals with x = 0.05 and 0.095, respectively. The extrapolated H_{c2}^{i\omega}(10 K) is equal to about 24 T -- that is the maximum "zero resistance" H_{c2}^{i\omega} (or irreversibility field) observed for any substituted MgB2 single crystals.[23, 24, 25] An important feature revealed in our C-substituted samples is the small difference between the "zero resistance" H_{c2}^{i\omega}(_T_) and the "onset" H_{c2}^{i\omega}(_T_on) upper critical fields. This is shown in Fig. 7,

The superconducting transition temperature measured with low current density (_i_ = 2.5 A/cm2) is _T__{c}=38.2, 34.3, and 30.1 K for crystals with x = 0, 0.05, and 0.095, respectively.

The images were recorded along the [0̄10] direction (left) and along the [0̄01] direction (right). A high level of structural perfection is observed. The low image contrast in the lower left part of the right image is due to an amorphous surface layer of the Mg(B0.95C0.05)2 grain, which is caused by the sample preparation for measurement.

  where the upper critical fields, obtained by using both criteria, are plotted. The only exception is observed for the x = 0.05 single crystal measured for H perpendicular to the ab plane. For this case, a significant difference between H_{c2}^{\rm{ir}}(T_{c}) and H_{c2}^{\rm{ir}}(T_{\rm{on}}) is observed for fields above 1 T. It is suggested that surface effects [27] are the origin; however, we are not able to prove this now.

Torque measurements performed as a function of angle in a constant magnetic field of 2-3 T at 2.2 K on carbon-substituted MgB_{2} show almost reversible angular dependence [see Fig. 8(a)], similar to the one observed in much lower fields for the unsubstituted material. [37] However, for higher magnetic fields irreversibility (in the angular dependence of torque) appears and a significant increase of the torque width is observed [see Fig. 8(b)], with an amplitude of almost one order of magnitude higher than the reversible torque value. The data presented in the Fig. 8(b) indicate the existence of strong pinning in the material, being effective up to the highest magnetic fields of 9 T in our experimental setup. Importantly, the appearance of strong pinning in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystals is correlated with a significant shift of the upper critical field and of the irreversibility line towards higher fields and temperatures in the H-T phase diagram. [38] The vanishing of the difference between torque signal for clockwise and counterclockwise change of magnetic field presented in Fig. 9 determines the irreversibility field H_{\rm{int}}(\theta), which can be considered as an estimation for the lower limit of H_{c2}(\theta). Since the difference does not vanish in the full angular range for the field as high as 7 or even 8 T at 2.2 K it means that H_{c2}^{\rm{ir}}(2.2 K) is higher than 8 T, consistent

A microscopic understanding of the mechanism responsible for the significant increase of H_{c2} in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystals is desirable. The value of the in-plane Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi_{GL} for the unsubstituted defect-free MgB_{2} compound is about 10.2 nm (Refs. 2,39). Assuming a decrease of the mean free path l as a result of the carbon substitution in MgB_{2} one may expect a decrease of the coherence length and an increase of H_{c2}. The estimation of the value of mean free path l associated with the observed changes in H_{c2} can be done based on the Pippard relation 1/\xi=1/\xi_{GL}+1/l. With the in-plane coherence length \xi_{GL} of 10.2 nm for unsubstituted compound[39] and estimated the in-plane coherence length \xi\equiv 6.4 nm, corresponding to H_{c2}^{\rm{i}c}\equiv 8 T for Mg(B_{0.937}C_{0.063})_{2}, an in-plane value of l\equiv 17.5 nm can be derived. A periodic in-plane defect distribution with a length scale of 17.5 nm would lead to the most effective pinning in the fields parallel to c axis as high as 7.8 T. The maximum of the peak effect (PE) for the field configuration parallel to c axis is observed in a somewhat smaller field of about 6 T. Furthermore, the ratio of the field at the peak effect maximum to H_{c2} is equal to about 0.75 for Mg(B_{0.937}C_{0.063})_{2}, lower than that obtained for unsubstituted MgB_{2}, evaluated to be 0.85.

In a previous paper concerning the peak effect in MgB_{2} we demonstrated that it signifies a disorder-induced phase transition of vortex matter.[38] In such a scenario, the considerably lower reduced field H/H_{c2} at the maximum of the PE at low temperatures in Mg(B_{0.937}C_{0.063})_{2} indicates that the amount of random-distributed pointlike disorders is increased by carbon substitution,[40] in agreement with x-ray data and transport results. However, most likely the "extrinsic" scenario alone could not fully describe the significant increase of H_{c2} in carbon-substituted MgB_{2}. The impact of carbon substitution on the band structure of Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} must be taken into account in the description of the changes observed in the position of H_{c2} in the H-T phase diagram as well. Carbon substitution dopes the conducting band with additional electrons and increases the Fermi energy E_{F}. However, additional investigations of a possible lower occupation of Mg in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} are necessary to make a definite statement about the shift of E_{F}. A more detailed analysis of the influence of carbon substitution on the electronic structure of MgB_{2} is presented elsewhere.[41]

## IV Conclusions

The superconducting transition temperature of the carbon-substituted MgB_{2} single crystals can be tuned in a wide temperature range between 10 and 39 K by adjustment of the nominal composition. In the case when SiC is used in the precursor, Si has been found to not incorporate into the structure, revealing C as more favorable dopant. Single-crystal structural investigations of Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} show an elongation of reflections in the c^{*} direction, indicating inhomogeneities of carbon distribution. The length scale of carbon inhomogeneities should be smaller than \xi. Torque and transport investigations reveal strong pinning at least up to 9 T for the field H perpendicular to the ab plane. This leads to an enhancement of the critical current and may cause the observed increase of the irreversibility field in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} despite a modest decrease of T_{c}. The observed increase of the upper critical field and the reduction of anisotropy reflect the subtle interplay between the various microscopic parameters describing the scattering and coupling within and between \sigma and \pi bands in pure and substituted MgB_{2}. Intrinsic changes should be considered such as modification of the Fermi surface, \sigma and \pi band gaps, and intraband and interband scattering.

###### Abstract

The growth of carbon-substituted magnesium diboride Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystals with 0 \leq x \approx 0.15 is reported, and the structural, transport, and magnetization data are presented. The superconducting transition temperature decreases monotonically with increasing carbon content in the full investigated range of substitution. By adjusting the nominal composition, T_{c} of substituted crystals can be tuned in a wide temperature range between 10 and 39 K. Simultaneous introduction of disorder by carbon substitution and significant increase of the upper critical field H_{c2} is observed. Comparing with the nonsubstituted compound, H_{c2} at 15 K for x =0.05 is enhanced by more than a factor of 2 for H oriented both perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane. This enhancement is accompanied by a reduction of the H_{c2}-anisotropy coefficient \gamma from 4.5 (for the nonsubstituted compound) to 3.4 and 2.8 for the crystals with x =0.05 and 0.095, respectively. At temperatures below 10 K, the single crystal with larger carbon content shows H_{c2} (defined at zero resistance) higher than 7 and 24 T for H oriented perpendicular and parallel to the ab plane, respectively. Observed increase of H_{c2} cannot be explained by the change in the coherence length due to the disorder-induced decrease of the mean free path only.

## I Introduction

For the possible large-scale applications of the MgB_{2} superconductor the upper critical field H_{c2} is a central materials parameter.^{1} For pure single crystals the out-of-plane H_{c2}^{\parallel}(0) is as low as 3.1 T (Ref. [2]) and, therefore, many efforts have been made to modify the superconducting properties of this material through chemical substitution. A brief review of the current status of the substitutional chemistry of MgB_{2} can be found in the paper by Cava _et al.^{3}_ Carbon substitution for boron appeared to be one of the most interesting, though the reported carbon solubility in MgB_{2} and its influence on T_{c} varies considerably depending on the synthesis route and starting materials.^{4-7} Carbon solubility ranging from 1.25% to 30% was reported^{4,6} when elemental magnesium, boron, and carbon were used as starting materials. Another approach for carbon substitution of MgB_{2} was suggested by Mickelson _et al.^{8}_ Using boron carbide (B_{4}C) as a source of carbon they achieved better mixing of B and C atoms. The samples had an estimated composition Mg(B_{0.9}C_{0.1})_{2}, and T_{c} was decreased by 7 K. Ribeiro _et al._ followed this approach and reported the optimization of synthetic conditions of carbon-doped samples leading to nearly single-phase Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} with T_{c}=22 K.^{9} A neutron diffraction study performed on their sample yielded a carbon substitution level of about 10%, and a linear relation between the unit cell parameter a and the C concentration was found.^{10} The authors showed that earlier reports overestimated the carbon content in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} because polycrystalline-carbon-substituted samples may contain significant amounts of impurity phases and the nominal content was assumed most often to be equal to the actual one. Refinement of neutron diffraction data performed on very carefully prepared polycrystalline samples showed that samples contain \sim73% of the Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} phase.^{10}

The improvement of flux pinning and the enhancement of the critical current density in MgB_{2} powder by both nanoparticle SiC (Ref. [11]) and nanocarbon doping^{12} was reported by Dou and co-workers. They claimed that simultaneous Si and C substitution for B raised the saturation limit of C in MgB_{2} considerably, while the T_{c} reduction is not pronounced (only 2.4 K for x =0.4). The shift of the irreversibility line towards higher fields and temperatures, caused by nanodiamond doping to MgB_{2}, was reported by Cheng _et al.^{13}_

Most of these substitutions involved polycrystalline samples. The availability of single crystals is expected to provide more detailed insight into the microscopic aspects of substitution, including the solubility limit and the T_{c} variation as a function of doping as well as the impact of disorder-induced defects on superconducting properties. Recently, several reports on carbon-substituted single crystals appeared. One of them presented shortly our results of the T_{c} dependence on carbon content.^{14} Lee _et al._ presented lattice parameters, magnetization and resistivity measurement data for MgB_{2} crystals with carbon content up to 15% (Ref. [15]). The data of the last report are in qualitative agreement with ours, presented here; however, quantitative differences exists. Lee _et al._ presented the nominal carbon content x in all of their plots and assumed that it is equal to the actual one; however, according to our experience the nominal carbon content for single crystals of Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} is different from the one calculated from the a lattice parameter dependence.

In the context of the recent discussions on the transport properties of MgB_{2} (Ref. [16]), it is of general interest to study the temperature dependence of the resistivity of single-phase compounds, where both the mean free path and the superconducting coherence length can vary considerably due to substitutions. Single crystals instead of polycrystalline materials are preferred to separate granularity effects from changes in the electron structure or the electron scattering process. Pure and aluminum-substituted MgB_{2} has been examined widely.[3, 17, 18, 19, 20] However, the carbon-substituted compounds have been studied only recently in both polycrystalline samples[21, 22] and single crystals.[15, 23, 24, 25] The value and anisotropy of the upper critical field H_{c2} for the Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x}) compounds have been reported in a limited range.[23, 24, 25] At 15 K, H_{c2} for optimally C-substituted MgB_{2} single crystals shows an increase by a factor of 2 for H applied parallel as well as perpendicular to the ab plane; however, this result depends somewhat on the H_{c2} definition.[26, 27, 28]

In this paper, we report the results of single-crystal growth, structure, resistivity, and magnetic property investigations of carbon-substituted MgB_{2}. We describe H_{c2} deduced from resistance measurements for both field configurations, for Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} crystals with x=0.05 and 0.095. Here, the critical temperature T_{c} at constant magnetic field is defined as a temperature where the nonzero-resistant state begins to develop in the zero-current limit. The introduction of disorder by carbon substitution increases H_{c2} as compared to that of MgB_{2}. However, the twofold increase of H_{c2} combined with the modest decrease of T_{c} by about 5 K cannot be explained by changes in the coherence length caused by the defect-induced decrease of the mean free path only.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} were grown under high pressure using a cubic anvil press. The applied pressure and temperature conditions for the growth of MgB_{2} single crystals were determined in our earlier study of the Mg-B-N phase diagram.[29] Magnesium (Fluka, >99% purity), amorphous boron (Alfa Aesar, >99.99%), carbon graphite powder (Alfa Aesar, >99.99%), and silicon carbide (Alfa Aesar, >99.8%) were used as starting materials. Amorphous boron was annealed under a dynamic vacuum at 1200 degC to minimize contamination by oxygen. Two types of precursors were prepared: in the first case, graphite served as a source of carbon; in the second type of precursors, SiC was added to a mixture of Mg and amorphous B. Starting materials with different nominal carbon content were mixed and pressed. A pellet was put into a BN container of 6 mm internal diameter and 8 mm length. Crystals were grown in the same way as the unsubstituted crystals. First, pressure was applied using a pyrophylite pressure transmitting cube as a medium; then, the temperature was increased during 1 h, up to the maximum of 1900-1950 degC, kept for 30 min, and decreased over 1-2 h.

The single-crystal x-ray diffraction investigations were carried out using two four-circle x-ray diffractometers (Siemens P4 and CAD4). The refinement of the crystal structure was made with the jana2000 program package.[30] Electrical resistivity measurements were performed with a 14-T Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS). Small single crystals were selected (typically with dimensions of 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.04 mm^{3}) to reduce any influence of crystal imperfections. The measuring current density was i =2.5 A/cm^{2}, to study the upper critical field properties, and varied from 0.25 to 40 A/cm^{2}, to examine the vortex dynamics, including I-V characteristics. The measurement current flowed in the ab plane and was perpendicular to the applied field. The field was oriented both parallel and perpendicular to the ab plane, which is the main plane of the MgB_{2} single crystal. Magnetic measurements have been performed with a noncommercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The temperature dependence of the dc magnetization in an external magnetic fields of H =1 -3 Oe was recorded for both zero-field-cooled and field-cooled conditions. Torque measurements were performed in a 9-T Quantum Design PPMS.

## III Results

### Crystal growth

Carbon-substituted Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} crystals were grown with dimensions up to 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.02 mm^{3}. They were black in color in contrast to golden nonsubstituted MgB_{2}. Table I presents the starting composition, estimated carbon content, and lattice parameters as well as the superconducting transition temperature of unsubstituted and carbon-substituted MgB_{2} single crystals. Energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis and laser ablation inductive coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectroscopy analyses performed on the SiC-doped crystals show only C and no traces of Si in the crystals. X-ray single-crystal analysis confirmed this finding (see next section). The carbon content in the crystals was estimated from the a lattice parameter, assuming the linear dependence of the a parameter on carbon content, according to Ref. [10]. Although it is a rough approximation, no other proof of carbon content was found and the x-ray refinement was not possible because of similar scattering factors for B and C. The variation of T_{c} as a function of lattice parameter a and carbon concentration is presented in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) together with the temperature dependence of magnetization curves [inset to Fig. 1(b)]. The superconducting transitions are relatively sharp even in highly doped crystals. With increasing C content, T_{c} decreases smoothly, and we note a more effective suppression of T_{c} when the C level exceeds ~10% (Fig. 1). By adjusting the carbon content in the starting mixture one can tune T_{c} in a wide range (39-10 K) for carbon content between x=0 and 0.15.

### Single-crystal structure analysis

Three single crystals MgB_{2}, Mg(B_{0.896}C_{0.104})_{2}, and Mg(B_{0.880}C_{0.150})_{2} were used for detailed structure analysis. The changes in the structures were expected to be minor, and therefore all experiments were handled under the same conditions. Pure MgB_{2} was refined for comparison. Cell parameters for all of the crystals were refined from one and the same set of 23 reflections in a wide range of \theta angles. No superstructure reflections were found; thus, we conclude a statistical distribution of carbon or silicon on the B site. A  preliminary study of reflection profiles revealed a highly anisotropic broadening for the substituted crystals. The two-dimensional profiles of reflections for Mg(B0.895C0.150)2 show the elongation of the reflections along the _c_deg direction in reciprocal space [Fig. 2(a)], while in the _adegb_deg plane the reflection profiles [Fig. 2(b)] are similar to those of the un-substituted phase. For Mg(B0.896C0.104)2 the elongation is smaller. In pure MgB2 the reflection profiles are the same in all directions of reciprocal space. The anisotropy of the reflections in carbon-substituted crystals indicates crystal disorder, but the structural investigations alone cannot identify the type of disorder. Microscopic phase separation suggested by Maurin _et al._7 should rather result in a number of discrete reflections, quite close to each other or partially overlapping, but local inhomogeneities of the carbon distribution in crystals may be one of the possible reasons for the broadening of reflections. The description and results of the single-crystal experiments are given in Table 2.

As was already mentioned, the carbon content at the B site for Mg(B1-Cs)2 was estimated from the a lattice parameter according to Ref. [10]. Boron and carbon contents were fixed throughout the entire refinement. The laser ablation ICP mass spectrometry analysis showed no silicon in the substituted crystals, prepared with SiC as a source of carbon. The refinement of Si content in the second crystal converged to zero. Thus, it was assumed that silicon was not present in crystals and was not considered in the final refinement.

First, Mg(B1-Cs)2 structures were refined in an isotropic approximation with R factors increasing from 0.028 to 0.052 for increasing x. Isotropic extinction refinement reduced the R factors by 0.004-0.01 with a significance level of extinction parameters not less than 3s (_s_ is the standard deviation). Successively, magnesium occupancy, anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (ADP), and anharmonic ADP were added to the refinements. The results of each step are given in Table 3. The refinement of pure MgB2 converged to low R factors without any peculiarities. The refinement of the Mg occupancy differed from unity within 1.5s and was fixed to unity in the final refinement. It is not the case for the substituted crystals. R factors and residual peaks at difference Fourier maps were significantly higher at each step compared to that of the unsubstituted phase, which means that there are some local distortions compared to the parent structure. The refinement of anisotropic or anharmonic ADP did not improve residual factors significantly or no improvement was observed. In the case of refinement of the anharmonic ADP the probability density function (PDF) for Mg produced strong negative regions and this approximation was rejected in the final refinement. Finally the Mg occupancy was refined for both substituted phases. It resulted in significant improvement of R factors and the 1.5-2 times decrease of residual peaks at the difference Fourier maps. Positional and atomic displacement parameters for each structure are given in Table 4.

The refinement showed Mg deficiency, increasing with increasing carbon content from the 0% for unsubstituted samples to about 10% for the C-substituted samples with the highest carbon amount of x = 0.15. The attempt of a direct determination of the ratio of Mg content to B and C content in Mg(B1-Cs)2 single crystals by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was not successful because of difficulties with proper determination of the carbon content. Nevertheless, incomplete EPMA data indicate much smaller if any magnesium deficiency as compared to that estimated by x-ray refinement.

A large increase of anisotropic ADP for all atoms with increasing x was observed. This fact suggests static disorder for both sites. Such disorder should lead to a shortening of Mg-C distances. In the structure of MgB2C2 (Ref. [31]) Mg-C distances vary in the range 2.25-2.52 A and similar variations may be expected in the substituted phases as well. It may be the reason for underestimation of magnesium occupancy, because Mg atoms may be shifted from an ideal deviation to create asymmetric coordination in unit cells where carbon atoms are present. Small positive residual peaks were observed 0.6-0.8 A from Mg and about 1.8-2.3 A from the B(C) site, which corresponds to interatomic distances in the structure mentioned above. Besides, in spite of careful experiments and refinements, R factors for substituted phases remained quite high compared to that of pure MgB2. Thus, it may be suggested that local disorder is present in structures  of substituted crystals, which cannot be described in conventional terms.

Field-cooled magnetization of carbon-substituted MgB_{2} was found to be significantly lower in comparison with that of an unsubstituted compound recorded at the same magnetic field (see Fig. 3). It provides an indication of increased pinning, most likely due to the local disorder introduced by the carbon substitution, in agreement with the results of x-ray investigations. The small value of the ratio of field-cooled to zero-field-cooled magnetization accompanied by a narrow transition width may also indicate the inhomogenous carbon distribution on a length scale of the distribution of carbon inhomogeneities below the coherence length \xi value rather than on the microscopic phase separation. If C were inhomogeneously distributed on a length scale larger than \xi, the magnetization versus temperature should show several steps or a broad transition.

Figure 4 shows the normalized in-plane resistance versus temperature for the Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystals with x =0,0.05, and 0.095. For the nonsubstituted sample, "the residual resistance ratio" RRR \equiv 7 [defined as R(300 K)/R(40 K)] is similar or larger than reported in the literature.[16, 28, 32, 33] This indicates a good quality of the single crystals. The nonlinear increase of the normalized resistance R(40 K)/R(300 K) with carbon substitution is observed and

The reflection of the C-substituted MgB_{2} crystal shows an elongation in the c^{*} direction. (b) \omega-\theta scan of 300 reflections of Mg(B_{0.85}C_{0.15})_{2}:c^{*} is perpendicular to the plane, a^{*}b^{*} is parallel to the plane, and a^{*} is parallel to the reflection; the contour at 0 (dashed line), 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, then contour step 200 sec^{-1}. The shape of the reflections is similar to that of the unsubstituted MgB_{2} crystal.

  this may result in a saturation effect. Such a saturation of R(40)/R(300) suggests that some changes in the transport properties of the substituted MgB_{2} single crystals cannot be explained by any simple model considering the reduction in the cross-section area of the sample as a main reason of the observed effects.[16] Most likely, the carbon substitution results in the creation of more microscopic than macroscopic defects acting as electron scattering centers. This is consistent with the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) results, shown in Fig. 5, where no carbon agglomerates or other extended structure defects have been observed. The appearance of microscopic scattering centers should result in a shorter mean free path and, as a consequence, in a decrease of the superconducting coherence length \xi. This should increase H_{c2}, as being actually observed for the C-substituted crystals.

The in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} for the substituted Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystal with x=0.05 is shown in Fig. 6. Despite the low RRR \equiv 2, the crystal exhibits relatively low \rho_{ab}(300 K) = 20 \mu\Omega cm if compared even with metallic copper [\rho(300 K \equiv 1.5 \mu\Omega cm, RRR \equiv 20-2000]. This feature seems to confirm the rather unusual transport properties of MgB_{2}, as discussed by Rowell.[16] For the sample with x =0.05 ,\rho_{ab} in the magnetic field H perpendicular to the ab plane is presented in the inset of Fig. 6. A sharp transition to the superconducting state is observed at zero field (\Delta T_{c} =0.05 K) and this transition widens in higher fields. For \mu_{0}H=2 and 3 T, a two-step-like behavior in \rho_{ab}(T) is observed at T_{c}, where a sharp drop at lower temperatures may be explained as a result of a vortex melting effect. The shape and temperature of the superconducting transition do not change significantly when the current density i=2.5 A/cm^{2}

At higher current densities, the vortex-driven state is observed with a peak effect that develops at moderate fields. Similar effects have been reported for the nonsubstituted MgB_{2} single crystals.[26] The differences in the resistivity of the single crystals with x =0.05 and 0.095 and for two field configurations (H perpendicular or parallel to the ab plane) seem to be caused mainly by the differences in the pinning force only. Generally, much sharper transitions are observed for the sample with x =0.095 and for the configuration where H is parallel to the ab plane. Detailed studies of the vortex dynamics in the driven state are being performed and will be published separately.

The upper critical fields are derived from the transport measurements, applying two definitions of the transition temperature. First, T_{\rm on} is determined by the linear extrapola

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} Parameter & MgB_{2} & MgB_{0.91} & MgB_{0.9} \\ (B_{0.896}C_{0.10\AA}) & (B_{0.850}C_{0.150}) \\ \hline _Occupation_, Mg & 1 & 0.910(11) & 0.891(14) \\ x, Mg & & 0 & \\ y, Mg & & 0 & \\ z, Mg & & 0 & \\ x, B/C & & 1/3 & \\ y, B/C & & 2/3 & \\ z, B/C & & 1/2 & \\ 10^{3}U_{11}, Mg & 4.95(17) & 8.54(18) & 11.3(3) \\ 10^{3}U_{33}, Mg & 5.81(18) & 9.05(19) & 12.4(4) \\ 10^{3}U_{12}, Mg & (10  tion of _R_(_T_) to the normal-state resistance from the first sudden drop observed at the transition. Second, T_{c} is defined as a temperature of the linear extrapolation of _R_(_T_) (from the similar transition area) to the zero resistance state. This definition of T_{c} corresponds to a temperature where R drops to zero for a current density small enough to significantly reduce or, depending on H, even avoid effects related to the vortex driven state. Thus, _T_on and T_{c} are the temperatures corresponding to the upper critical field and the irreversibility field, respectively.[23, 34] However, for H perpendicular to the _ab_ plane and in a case when those critical temperatures differ much one from another, _T_on seems to be influenced by surface effects and, therefore, _H__c_2 is determined more adequate if being associated with T_{c} (Ref. [26]). This definition of _H__c_2 is consistent with bulk measurements of the magnetization,[26]; specific heat,[27] and thermal conductivity.[35]

The upper critical fields of the Mg(B1-C)x)2 single crystals are shown in Fig. 7 for H parallel (H_{c2}^{i\omega}) and perpendicular (H_{c2}^{i\omega}) to the _ab_ plane. At 20 K, an anisotropy \gamma =(H_{c2}^{i\omega}/H_{c2}^{i\omega})2 =3.4 and 2.8 is measured for the crystals with x = 0.05 and 0.095, respectively. The observed decrease of the anisotropy from \gamma(20 K) \equiv 4.2-4.5, measured in the nonsubstituted MgB2 (Refs. [26, 28, 32, 36]) to \gamma(20 K) \equiv 2.8 reflects the general reduction of the electronic anisotropy due to substitution. A small anisotropy \gamma(20 K) \equiv 2.5 has been reported for a Mg(B1-C)2 single crystal with x = 0.02, where _H__c_2 was measured by local ac susceptibility.[24] It is difficult to comment on this result because a large uncertainty in the determination of the carbon content appears in single crystals grown under different conditions. It is known that the real carbon content differs much from the nominal content, as shown by neutron diffraction experiments.[10]

Superior properties of the single crystal with x = 0.095 manifest themselves at temperatures below 10 K (see Fig. 7). At these temperatures, H_{c2}^{i\omega} for this crystal is larger than H_{c2}^{i\omega} derived for the less substituted sample with x = 0.05. For H parallel to the _ab_ plane, crossing of the H_{c2}^{i\omega}(_T_) dependences obtained for both single crystals is predicted at 10 K by linear extrapolation of H_{c2}^{i\omega}(_T_) from 20 and 17 K for the crystals with x = 0.05 and 0.095, respectively. The extrapolated H_{c2}^{i\omega}(10 K) is equal to about 24 T -- that is the maximum "zero resistance" H_{c2}^{i\omega} (or irreversibility field) observed for any substituted MgB2 single crystals.[23, 24, 25] An important feature revealed in our C-substituted samples is the small difference between the "zero resistance" H_{c2}^{i\omega}(_T_) and the "onset" H_{c2}^{i\omega}(_T_on) upper critical fields. This is shown in Fig. 7,

The superconducting transition temperature measured with low current density (_i_ = 2.5 A/cm2) is _T__{c}=38.2, 34.3, and 30.1 K for crystals with x = 0, 0.05, and 0.095, respectively.

The images were recorded along the [0̄10] direction (left) and along the [0̄01] direction (right). A high level of structural perfection is observed. The low image contrast in the lower left part of the right image is due to an amorphous surface layer of the Mg(B0.95C0.05)2 grain, which is caused by the sample preparation for measurement.

  where the upper critical fields, obtained by using both criteria, are plotted. The only exception is observed for the x = 0.05 single crystal measured for H perpendicular to the ab plane. For this case, a significant difference between H_{c2}^{\rm{ir}}(T_{c}) and H_{c2}^{\rm{ir}}(T_{\rm{on}}) is observed for fields above 1 T. It is suggested that surface effects [27] are the origin; however, we are not able to prove this now.

Torque measurements performed as a function of angle in a constant magnetic field of 2-3 T at 2.2 K on carbon-substituted MgB_{2} show almost reversible angular dependence [see Fig. 8(a)], similar to the one observed in much lower fields for the unsubstituted material. [37] However, for higher magnetic fields irreversibility (in the angular dependence of torque) appears and a significant increase of the torque width is observed [see Fig. 8(b)], with an amplitude of almost one order of magnitude higher than the reversible torque value. The data presented in the Fig. 8(b) indicate the existence of strong pinning in the material, being effective up to the highest magnetic fields of 9 T in our experimental setup. Importantly, the appearance of strong pinning in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystals is correlated with a significant shift of the upper critical field and of the irreversibility line towards higher fields and temperatures in the H-T phase diagram. [38] The vanishing of the difference between torque signal for clockwise and counterclockwise change of magnetic field presented in Fig. 9 determines the irreversibility field H_{\rm{int}}(\theta), which can be considered as an estimation for the lower limit of H_{c2}(\theta). Since the difference does not vanish in the full angular range for the field as high as 7 or even 8 T at 2.2 K it means that H_{c2}^{\rm{ir}}(2.2 K) is higher than 8 T, consistent

  with the resistance studies (Fig. 7). The last value is more than twice the value of 3.1 T determined for H_{c2}^{\rm{i}c}(0) of the nonsubstituted MgB_{2} single crystals.[2]

A microscopic understanding of the mechanism responsible for the significant increase of H_{c2} in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} single crystals is desirable. The value of the in-plane Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi_{GL} for the unsubstituted defect-free MgB_{2} compound is about 10.2 nm (Refs. 2,39). Assuming a decrease of the mean free path l as a result of the carbon substitution in MgB_{2} one may expect a decrease of the coherence length and an increase of H_{c2}. The estimation of the value of mean free path l associated with the observed changes in H_{c2} can be done based on the Pippard relation 1/\xi=1/\xi_{GL}+1/l. With the in-plane coherence length \xi_{GL} of 10.2 nm for unsubstituted compound[39] and estimated the in-plane coherence length \xi\equiv 6.4 nm, corresponding to H_{c2}^{\rm{i}c}\equiv 8 T for Mg(B_{0.937}C_{0.063})_{2}, an in-plane value of l\equiv 17.5 nm can be derived. A periodic in-plane defect distribution with a length scale of 17.5 nm would lead to the most effective pinning in the fields parallel to c axis as high as 7.8 T. The maximum of the peak effect (PE) for the field configuration parallel to c axis is observed in a somewhat smaller field of about 6 T. Furthermore, the ratio of the field at the peak effect maximum to H_{c2} is equal to about 0.75 for Mg(B_{0.937}C_{0.063})_{2}, lower than that obtained for unsubstituted MgB_{2}, evaluated to be 0.85.

In a previous paper concerning the peak effect in MgB_{2} we demonstrated that it signifies a disorder-induced phase transition of vortex matter.[38] In such a scenario, the considerably lower reduced field H/H_{c2} at the maximum of the PE at low temperatures in Mg(B_{0.937}C_{0.063})_{2} indicates that the amount of random-distributed pointlike disorders is increased by carbon substitution,[40] in agreement with x-ray data and transport results. However, most likely the "extrinsic" scenario alone could not fully describe the significant increase of H_{c2} in carbon-substituted MgB_{2}. The impact of carbon substitution on the band structure of Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} must be taken into account in the description of the changes observed in the position of H_{c2} in the H-T phase diagram as well. Carbon substitution dopes the conducting band with additional electrons and increases the Fermi energy E_{F}. However, additional investigations of a possible lower occupation of Mg in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} are necessary to make a definite statement about the shift of E_{F}. A more detailed analysis of the influence of carbon substitution on the electronic structure of MgB_{2} is presented elsewhere.[41]

## IV Conclusions

The superconducting transition temperature of the carbon-substituted MgB_{2} single crystals can be tuned in a wide temperature range between 10 and 39 K by adjustment of the nominal composition. In the case when SiC is used in the precursor, Si has been found to not incorporate into the structure, revealing C as more favorable dopant. Single-crystal structural investigations of Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} show an elongation of reflections in the c^{*} direction, indicating inhomogeneities of carbon distribution. The length scale of carbon inhomogeneities should be smaller than \xi. Torque and transport investigations reveal strong pinning at least up to 9 T for the field H perpendicular to the ab plane. This leads to an enhancement of the critical current and may cause the observed increase of the irreversibility field in Mg(B_{1-x}C_{x})_{2} despite a modest decrease of T_{c}. The observed increase of the upper critical field and the reduction of anisotropy reflect the subtle interplay between the various microscopic parameters describing the scattering and coupling within and between \sigma and \pi bands in pure and substituted MgB_{2}. Intrinsic changes should be considered such as modification of the Fermi surface, \sigma and \pi band gaps, and intraband and interband scattering.
