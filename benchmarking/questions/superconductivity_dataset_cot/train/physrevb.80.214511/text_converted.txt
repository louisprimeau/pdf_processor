###### Abstract

We present measurements of resistivity and thermopower S of
Fe_(1 + x)Te_(1 − y)Se_(y) single crystalline samples with _y_=0, 0.1,
0.2, 0.3, and 0.45 in zero field and in a magnetic field _B_=8 T. We
find that the shape of thermopower curves appears quite peculiar in
respect to that measured in other Fe-based superconducting families. We
propose a qualitative analysis of the temperature behavior of S, where
the samples are described as almost compensated semimetals: different
electron and hole bands with similar carrier concentrations compete and
their relative contribution to the thermoelectric transport depends on
the respective filling, mobility, and coupling with phonons. For y ≅
0.2, superconductivity occurs and the optimum Se-doping level for a
maximum _T_(c)_ of 13 K turns out to be _y_=0.3. At low temperatures,
evidence of a contribution to S by an excitation-drag mechanism is found
while at high temperatures a strikingly flat behavior of S is explained
within a narrow-band Hubbard model.

## I Introduction

The newly discovered class of Fe-based superconductors [1] is attracting
worldwide attention due to their applicative potential with transition
temperatures above 50 K (Ref. [2]) and very high upper critical fields
[3, 4] as well as for fundamental studies of superconducting mechanisms,
where the role of Fe is yet to be clarified. Various phases have been
synthesized to date; all of them share some common features such as
square planar sheets of tetrahedrally coordinated Fe ions in their
crystal structure and the similar shape of their Fermi surfaces. In
particular, in the so-called "11" phase of iron chalcogenides (FeCh,
Ch=chalcogenide), the Fermi surface is composed by cylindrical electron
sections at the zone corners, cylindrical heavy-hole sections around the
zone center and, depending on the stoichiometry, other small hole
pockets at the zone center. [5] Such topology fulfils the condition for
nesting and is thought to give rise to a spin-density-wave (SDW) ground
state. The nesting condition is gradually lost upon doping of holes or
electrons. The 11 phase is one of the most studied due to its simple
structure, the possibility of growing fairly large single crystals [6]
and the reduced toxicity of its constituents compared to As. However,
this phase exhibits peculiar properties as compared to other Fe-based
phases, namely, the noncollinear orientation of antiferromagnetic
ordering vector and nesting vector [7, 8] and no clear signatures in
favor of a SDW gap [9, 10, 12]. Concerning the former point, it has been
suggested either that magnetism and superconductivity arise from
different interactions or that Cooper pairing does not originate from
the itinerant spin fluctuations that accompany the suppression of the
SDW state [10], as was instead initially suggested [5, 11], in analogy
with the other Fe-based phases. Concerning the gapless SDW state, it has
been suggested that the ground state of Fe chalcogenides is that of a
nearly electron-hole compensated semimetal [10], consistently with
Hall-effect data [12].

Excess Fe occupying randomly octahedral sites seems to be ever present
in synthesized compounds of the 11 phase [12] and it has a dramatic
effect on the ground state of the compound [7, 8]. Excess Fe is thought
to be in the Fe⁺ valence state so that it dopes the system with
electrons; moreover, it has a large magnetic moment (2.4$\mu_{\rm B}$)
which may have a pair-breaking effect [11].

The 11 compounds undergo a structural and magnetic transition at the
same temperature, which is around 65 K and is insensitive to the
application of a magnetic field [12]. Upon doping, for example with Se
or S substitution, superconductivity occurs [6, 13, 14].

In order to shed light on the peculiar character of the Fe chalcogenides
as compared to other Fe-based superconductors, measurements of the
Seebeck coefficient S may offer precious information about charge
carriers, Fermi surface, density of states, and scattering mechanisms in
nonsuperconducting parent compounds as well as in the normal state of
doped compounds, where the isovalent substitution of Te by Se brings
about the superconductivity. Such information would be complementary to
that provided by Hall-effect, resistivity, and magnetic measurements.
Yet, to the best of our knowledge, only one Seebeck effect measurement
has been reported on a pure FeSe polycrystalline sample [15] but no
measurements on the Fe(Te,Se) system, to date. Even a set of Hall-effect
data of a series of Fe(Te,Se) samples with different Se content is still
missing in literature. On the other hand, several measurements of
Seebeck effect on other Fe-based phases have been presented [16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Common features are a maximum of the magnitude
of the Seebeck coefficient S in proximity of the structural/magnetic
transition, generally attributed to a sharp change in the scattering
mechanism, as well as a change in sign of S, attributed to the multiband
character of transport. The fact that the 11 phase presents no SDW gap
and thereby no carrier condensation below the transition may be, in
principle, responsible of a significantly different behavior of S, as
compared to other Fe-based phases. In the present work we present
resistivity and Seebeck effect measurements on single crystals of
various compositions Fe_(1 + x)Te_(1 − y)Se_(y).

## II Experiment

We prepared Fe_(1 + x)Te_(1 − y)Se_(y) single-crystalline samples by the
Bridgeman method. Pieces of highly pure Fe, Te, and Se were mixed in
nominal ratio Fe:Te:Se=(1-_x_):(1+_y_):_y_ (with _x_=0-0.1 and _y_=0,
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.45) then heated to 930-960 ^(∘)C in sealed quartz
reactors and slowly cooled to room temperature. Single-phase,
single-crystalline samples were obtained for the whole series as proven
by x-rays diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive
x-ray microanalysis reported elsewhere.[25, 26] It is possible that our
transport measurements probe a percolative path of minimum resistivity,
more likely at the crystal surface, whose local properties depart from
those of the bulk sample. This concerns mainly the local excess Fe as
compared to the average excess Fe. The actual average excess Fe is not
the same for all the samples and was estimated by the Rietveld
refinement of x-rays diffraction data as reported in Table 1. It ranges
from 0.013 to 0.087. We have found that only in the case of y = 0.3, the
excess Fe content has a well visible effect in the transport properties,
such as resistivity and Seebeck effect, whereas in the other cases
transport properties are determined mainly by the Se content and only
weakly affected by the Fe stoichiometry. Nevertheless, it is worth
remembering that even small changes in the actual Fe content can have a
non-negligible influence on some properties, such as the magnetic
susceptibility, as reported elsewhere.[25, 26]

We measured both resistivity and Seebeck effect in a Quantum Design
physical property measurement system (PPMS) as a function of temperature
from 5 to 300 K. In the case of the S measurement, we applied a
square-wave heat flow along the Fe planes, with adjustable period (from
400 to 1450 s) and thermal gradient (from 0.1 to few K), and measured
the related voltage drop decay; the measurements were carried out both
in zero field and in a magnetic field of 8 T, parallel to the Fe planes.

## III Results

In Fig. 1, the resistivities of the six samples are presented. The
Fe_(1 + x)Te sample presents a discontinuity and an abrupt change in
slope at the magnetic/structural transition at 66 K. In the
Fe_(1 + x)Te_(0.9)Se_(0.1) sample, a similar feature, shifted at a lower
temperature ∼39 K, is seen. Moreover, the onset of a superconducting
transition appears at 10 K, even if the resistivity does not vanish
above 5 K. All the other samples present a superconducting transition
with vanishing resistivity. The highest transition temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ is found in the Fe_(1 + x)Te_(0.9)Se_(0.3) samples, as shown
in the bottom panel of Fig. 2(b). In particular, of the two different
samples with y = 0.3 and bulk excess Fe content x = 0.053 and x = 0.013,
called samples (a) and (b), respectively, the optimal one in terms of
$T_{\rm c}$ turns out to be the latter. This optimal sample is also
characterized by a metallic slope as a function of temperature above
$T_{\rm c}$ whereas all the other samples exhibit a weak negative slope
of resistivity as a function of temperature. This result is consistent
with magnetic measurements on the same samples,[25, 26] which show bulk
superconductivity only for this optimal composition. We notice that bulk
superconductivity has been found in a Fe_(1 + x)Te_(0.6)Se_(0.4) sample
in Ref. [27] whereas no sign of bulk superconductivity has been found by
specific-heat measurements in a Fe_(1 + x)Te_(0.55)Se_(0.45) sample in
Ref. [6]; indeed, this seems to be the limit Se content below which bulk
superconductivity may or may not appear, depending on the excess Fe
content.

In Fig. 2(a) we present thermopower curves of the six samples as a
function of temperature. It can be seen that in the high-temperature
regime, differently from all the other Fe-based superconductors, the
Seebeck coefficient S is nearly constant; its value increases
monotonically with increasing Se content y, from a negative value
_S_(300 K) =−0.85 μV/K for the _y_=0 sample to a positive saturation
value slightly above +7 μV/K for the samples with y > 0.3. This trend of
_S_(300 K) is also plotted in the uppermost panel of Fig. 2(b).

In the Fe_(1 + x)Te sample, S undergoes an abrupt steplike change at the
magnetic/structural transition around 66 K, in agreement with the step
in the resistivity curve, it reaches a minimum value and eventually
tends to vanish when the temperature tends to zero. The y = 0.1 sample
is reminiscent of the same behavior but the transition appears to be
broadened and the transition temperature suppressed below 50 K. The
curve passes from a positive constant value around +0.97 μV/K to a
minimum negative value; the crossover

quality.

temperature $T_{\rm cr}$ where S changes in sign is 66 K. The other
samples with y >= 0.2 follow the same trend described above in the
high-temperature regime but are pretty different at the lowest
temperatures: consistent with resistivity curves, the Seebeck
coefficient becomes zero at finite temperatures, indicating the onset of
the superconducting state. The temperature $T_{\rm c}$ where S vanishes
is around 11 K for the y = 0.2 sample, it reaches 13 K with increasing y
and then slightly decreases in the y = 0.45 sample. This trend of
$T_{\rm c}$ is plotted in the bottom panel of Fig. 2(b) and confirms
that y = 0.3 is the optimal Se concentration for superconductivity. The
transition temperatures extracted from resistivity and Seebeck effect
are slightly different, either for reasons related to the measuring
technique, as the Seebeck measurement is much slower and averages out
the signal over a larger temperature interval during the temperature
sweep, or due to the particular criterion chosen to define $T_{\rm c}$,
or else due to intrinsic reasons related to the difference in these
properties, as noted in Ref. [24]. However the trend of $T_{\rm c}$ as a
function of y is alike. Above the superconducting transition, the
samples with 0.2 <= y <= 0.45 exhibit a similar behavior with a negative
minimum of S, a crossover at $T_{\rm cr}$ where S changes in sign, and a
constant positive high-temperature value. The crossover temperature
increases monotonically with increasing y >= 0.2 as shown in the second
panel of Fig. 2(b) while the minimum value of S increases in magnitude
with y for the 0.2 < y < 0.45 samples but it decreases for the y = 0.45
sample as shown in the third panel of Fig. 2(b).

The effect of the application of a magnetic field is very weak in all
cases. In Fig. 3, the S curve at B = 0 and B = 8 T are compared for all
the six samples. In the high-temperature regime, not shown, the effect
of the magnetic field is negligible and the B = 0 and B = 8 T curves
merge within the experimental uncertainty. In the low-temperature regime
around the negative minimum of S, the B = 8 T curves are systematically
smaller in magnitude than the B = 0 curves. Finally, the 8 T field
slightly lowers the superconducting transition temperature; the shift of
$T_{\rm c}$ is smaller than 1 K for all samples, consistently with the
very large upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}^{\rm f}$ parallel to the Fe
planes reported in literature.[12, 3]

## IV Discussion

The Seebeck coefficient in a metal in the diffusive regime can be
expressed as[28]

$$S = \frac{\pi^{2}K_{B}^{2}T}{3q}\left.\left[\frac{1}{\sigma(E)}\frac {d\sigma(E)}{dE}\right]\right|_{E=E_{F}}$$
(1)
$$= \frac{\pi^{2}K_{B}^{2}T}{3q}\left.\left(\frac{N}{n}+\frac{1}{ \tau}\frac{d\tau}{dE}\right)\right|_{E=E_{F}},$$

where K_(B) is the Boltzmann constant, N is the density of states, E_(F)
is the Fermi energy, q is the electron charge (with positive sign for
hole transport and negative sign for electron transport), n is the
charge-carrier density, σ is the conductivity, and τ is the scattering
time. Usually the first term is dominant so that S has the same sign of
the charge carriers. The second term depends on the scattering mechanism
and is negative or negligible as the energy dependence of τ is usually
described by a power law τ∝E^(−α) with α > 0. Yet, close to a
transition, if any abrupt change in the scattering mechanism occurs,
also the second term may play a role.

When more than one band cross the Fermi level and contribute to the
transport, Eq. (1) describes the contribution of each band to the
Seebeck effect and the overall Seebeck effect is the sum of the band
contributions, weighted by the respective band conductivities

$$S = \frac{\Sigma\sigma_{i}S_{i}}{\Sigma\sigma_{i}},$$
(2)

where i is the band index and σ_(i) and S_(i) are the electrical
conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of the ith band, respec

following quantities are plotted as a function of the Se content y

tively. In the case of Fe(Te,Se) compounds, four or five bands are
indeed thought to contribute to transport, depending on the
composition.[5, 10]

Considering the curves of Fig. 2(a) and specifically the
high-temperature behavior plotted in the topmost panel of Fig. 2(b), it
can be said that the isovalent substitution of Te with Se results in an
effect equivalent to introducing holes in the system so that the
high-temperature Seebeck coefficient passes from negative to positive
values with increasing y. In parallel, the resistivity decreases with
increasing y. In fact, the structure is stabilized by either excess Fe
or Se substitution; hence, with increasing Se substitution, less excess
Fe is required.[26] As excess Fe is in the +1 valence state, it dopes
electrons into the system, so that the effect of Se substitution results
in less electron doping and is equivalent to hole doping. Beside this
scenario, this hole doping could be alternatively explained as an effect
of band modification by isovalent substitution of Se. Regarding the
effect of hole doping on the Seebeck value at high temperatures, it is
clearly understood in terms of Eq. (2), by assuming that with increasing
y the conductivities of the hole bands increase and the high-temperature
behavior of the thermopower is eventually dominated by the positive
Seebeck coefficients of the hole bands. We notice that in a single band
metal, the first term of Eq. (1) yields a decrease in S with increasing
doping so that the trend of S(300 K) as a function of y can be accounted
for only within a multiband picture, where the relative contributions of
the different bands change with y.[29] This effect is particularly
dramatic in all Fe-based superconductors due to their nature of almost
compensated metals with bands of carriers of opposite signs and nearly
equal charge concentrations. In the 11 phase, the small magnitude of the
Seebeck coefficient, which hardly exceeds 10 μV/K as compared to those
of other Fe-based phases, that are several tens of μV/K,[16] suggests
that this charge compensation is even more balanced.

The strictly constant dependence of S on temperature at high
temperatures is remarkable and peculiar with respect to other Fe-based
families. Such behavior has been predicted in the narrow-band Hubbard
model, valid for semiconductors and metals, at sufficiently high
temperatures, where the kinetic terms of S can be neglected;[30, 31]
hence the high-temperature flatness of the S curves seems to point out
that in iron chalcogenides transport has a more localized character than
in other Fe-based families. Such higher localization is also confirmed
by magnetic susceptivity data on the same samples, showing a more
evident Curie-Weiss behavior.[25, 26] In the case of strong on-site
Coulomb repulsion[32]U ≫ K_(B)T, the model predicts

$$S(T\rightarrow\infty)=\frac{K_{B}}{q}\text{ln}\left(2\frac{1-n}{n}\right),$$
(3)

where n is the carrier density per atomic site. This description has
been applied to account for the high-temperature constant behavior of S
in metallic La₂CuO_(4.β) (Ref. [33]) and semiconducting
La₂CuO_(4.β).[34] This model has been developed only for single band
systems, which is not our case; if we try to apply it to our data, from
our S values at high temperature, we get that n varies by 3

temperature for the six samples in the low-temperature region, in zero
field and in a magnetic field B = 8 T.

system, to account for the flat high-temperature behavior of S.

Also the crossover temperature _T_cr where S changes in sign can be
interpreted in terms of a multiband picture. Below _T_cr the electron
bands dominate the thermoelectrical transport and S is negative;
however, if these electron bands are more strongly coupled with phonons
or other excitations than the hole bands, their conductivity has a
steeper temperature dependence and eventually, above _T_cr,
thermoelectrical transport becomes dominated by the hole bands. In this
scenario, the increase in _T_cr with y, shown in the second panel of
Fig. 2(b), indicates that, despite the relative weight of holes in the
thermoelectrical transport at high temperatures increases with
increasing y, the temperature range over which electrons dominate
becomes broader. These two findings could be reconciled in the
hypothesis that Se substitution is effective in either decreasing the
coupling with excitations of carriers in the electron channel or in
increasing the coupling in the hole channel. Indeed, within each band,
the temperature dependence of scattering rate is proportional to the
coupling strength; thereby, if the coupling of hole bands increases with
y, the scattering rate in hole bands increases with temperature more
quickly for larger y so that the hole bands start to dominate
thermoelectrical transport only beyond a larger value of the _T_cr
temperature. This hypothesis of increasing hole band coupling with
increasing y seems consistent with the identification of such coupling
with the pairing mechanism responsible for the occurrence of
superconductivity in the Se substituted samples.

In the Fe1+xTe sample, the abrupt change in S at the magnetic and
structural transition is likely again an indication that the relative
contribution to transport of the different bands undergoes a dramatic
change. A more or less sharp change in S at the transition is a common
feature of all Fe-based superconductors and respective parent compounds;
[16-24] a nonmonotonic behavior with local minima and maxima is often
observed, [16,19,20,23,24] pointing to the complexity of the competing
mechanisms into play. Also in our case, other mechanisms, besides this
rearrangement of multiband contributions, may yield significant effects,
even if the simultaneous occurrence of the structural and magnetic
transitions in iron chalcogenides may make it difficult to discriminate
the different contributions. First, a sudden change in the scattering
mechanism, that is the second term of Eq. (1), may undergo an abrupt
change at the transition; indeed, scattering by spin fluctuations
associated to either the SDW state or the antiferromagnetic (AF)
ordering may change dramatically. Second, the spin-entropy term of S may
be affected by the magnetic ordering, which could indeed limit the
energetically allowable spin configurations of carriers due to the
exchange interaction between the magnetic ions and the carriers
themselves. The change in slope observed in the temperature dependence
of resistivity (see Fe1+xTe curve in Fig. 1) can be reconciled with
either the above scenarios of rearrangement of multiband contributions
and change in the scattering mechanism. However, the Hall-effect
measurements reported in literature are more consistent with the band
rearrangement picture, as the Hall resistance exhibits an abrupt step at
the transition either with [12] or without [13] a change in sign,
possibly depending on the excess Fe content.

The sample Fe1+xTe0.9Se0.1 can be considered to be midway between the
behavior of the parent compound and that of the superconducting samples
with y 0.2. Indeed, for 0.2 <= y 0.3, a monotonic trend of increasing
_T_cr with increasing y is observed. The magnitude of S at the minimum,
|_S_min|, and _T_c increase with increasing y 0.2 but they decrease
again for the y = 0.45 sample. |_S_min| may be viewed as a measure of
the charge density unbalance between the electrons and hole bands; this
unbalance is thought to destroy the nesting condition for the formation
of the spin-density-wave ground state thus favoring the onset of the
superconducting ground state. Indeed, the sample with the largest
|_S_min| value, that is, the Fe1+xTe0.9Se0.3 sample (sample b), also has
bulk superconductivity, as seen in magnetic measurements, [25,26] and
the largest _T_c. Yet we suggest another interpretation of this
proportionality between _T_c and |_S_min|, namely, that at low
temperatures, beside the diffusive term of S expressed by Eq. (1), there
is a phonon-drag term, [35] or, more in general, an excitation-drag
term. Such a term may indeed reveal the presence of a strong interaction
between electrons and excitations, possibly spin fluctuations, which may
be identified with the pairing mechanism that ultimately determine the
_T_c. The examination of the shape of the S curves in the range between
the temperature of the minimum of S (_T_min) and the saturation
temperature allows to substantiate this hypothesis: indeed, the curves
of all the samples, except the Fe1+xTe one, are very well described by a
power law _x_T_-1 in the range from  1.5_T_min up to the onset of the
flat behavior [see dashed black lines in Fig. 2(a)]; this law is just a
signature of a drag term in the thermopower. [36]

The large magnetic field of 8 T, besides shifting the superconducting
transition temperature proportionally to (_dH_c2/_dT_c)-1 = 0.1 K/T, has
the effect of decreasing the magnitude of S at low temperature by few
percent. This dependence is opposite to that observed in SmAsFeO and
NdAsFeO oxypnicides. [23] In our case, it may be related to the magnetic
field dependence of the spin-fluctuation-drag contribution to the
thermopower: as the spin fluctuations are quenched by the magnetic
field, they drag the electrons less than at B = 0. This has been
observed experimentally in different systems with spin fluctuations
[37,38] and was theoretically predicted by Granemann. [39] Such spin
fluctuations coupled with the charge carriers may be identified with the
incommensurate two-dimensional spin excitations that have been found by
inelastic neutron-scattering measurements; [40] their contribution
dominates the spin-fluctuation spectrum and is possibly responsible for
the pairing mechanism.

All the above discussions are qualitative and based on conjectures. A
theoretical backing could provide valuable information about
conductivities, carrier density, and phonon couplings of each band for
different chemical compositions, which would be necessary ingredients
for quantitative analysis of our experimental data. This could help in
casting light on the electronic mechanisms which determine the ground
state in these 11 phase samples and more in general in all Fe-based
phases. In parallel, experimental measurements of other transport
properties such as magnetoresistivity and Hall effect on single-crystal
samples or on epitaxial thin films would help in completing a consistent
picture.

## V Conclusions

We measure the Seebeck coefficient curves of Fe_(1 + x)Te_(1 − y)Se_(y)
single-crystalline samples with y= 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.45 in zero
field and in a magnetic field B= 8 T, in order to evidence the
peculiarities of the so-called 11 phase among the Fe-based
superconductors. Indeed, Seebeck curves exhibit a fairly different shape
as respect to the ones measured in the other phases. We find that Se
doping favors hole transport in the system, however different bands of
both electrons and holes contribute to the total Seebeck coefficient.
Due to the almost compensated metallic character of these systems, the
relative contribution of the different bands yields dramatic changes in
S as a function of temperature and doping, yielding a superconducting
ground state for y ≡ 0.2. The optimal Se concentration for
superconductivity turns out to be y= 0.3 with an excess Fe content
x=0.013. At low temperatures, an excitation-drag contribution to the
thermopower, which is possibly closely related to the
excitation-mediated pairing, is identified; its weak but detectable
magnetic field dependence suggests that such excitations are spin
fluctuations. At high temperatures, the Seebeck effect is strictly flat,
which is a peculiar behavior among other Fe-based families and points to
a more localized type of transport in iron chalcogenides.

of completely compensated bands, S vanishes; when carriers of one type
are doped into the system S increases as terms of opposite sign no
longer cancel out in Eq. (2); eventually, at high doping levels, when
one type of carriers dominates transport, S decreases with increasing
doping as predicted by Eq. (1) for a single band system. * [30] P. M.
