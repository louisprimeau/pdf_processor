  measurements of the gap structure of polycrystalline samples are accounted for by nodeless single gap \(s\)-wave superconductivity [27; 28; 29; 30], but different conclusions are drawn from recent point contact spectroscopy results from single crystal measurements, which give evidence for multiple gaps [38]. As such, it is important to perform further measurements of Re\({}_{6}\)Zr single crystals sensitive to low energy excitations to clarify this issue. In this paper we study the superconducting order parameter of single crystalline Re\({}_{6}\)Zr by measuring the magnetic penetration depth and specific heat of single crystals, which are both consistent with a single nodeless isotropic gap with a moderate coupling strength.

## II Experimental Details

Single crystals of Re\({}_{6}\)Zr were synthesized using the Czochralski method, as described in Ref. [38]. Magnetization measurements were performed using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS) with both field cooling (FC) and zero-field cooling (ZFC), with a small applied magnetic field of 10 Oe. The electrical resistivity \(\rho(T)\) was measured by using a standard four-probe method from room temperature down to 0.3 K in a \({}^{3}\)He refrigerator. The specific heat \(C(T)\) was measured using a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) with a \({}^{3}\)He insert down to around 0.6 K. The temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth shift \(\Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(T)-\lambda(0)\) was measured using a tunnel-diode-oscillator (TDO) technique in a \({}^{3}\)He cryostat down to 0.35 K. The operating frequency of the TDO setup is about 7 MHz, with a noise level as low as 0.1 Hz. For the TDO measurements, the sample was cut into a regular shape with dimensions of 700\(\times\)500\(\times\)200 \(\mu\)m\({}^{3}\) and mounted onto a sapphire rod so that it may be placed into the coil without making contact. The sample experiences a very small ac field of about 20 mOe along the [100] direction induced by the coil, which is much smaller than the lower critical field \(H_{c1}\), ensuring that the sample remains in the Meissner state, so that the change of the magnetic penetration depth \(\Delta\lambda(T)\) is proportional to the frequency change \(\Delta f(T)=f(T)-f(0)\). Here \(\Delta\lambda(T)=G\,\Delta f(T)\), where the calibration constant \(G\) is determined by the geometry of the sample and coil [39].

## III Results and Discussion

Single crystals of Re\({}_{6}\)Zr were characterized by the measurements of the electrical resistivity \(\rho(T)\) and magnetic susceptibility \(4\pi\,\chi(T)\), which are displayed in Fig. 1. \(\rho(T)\) exhibits metallic behavior in the normal state with a residual resistivity of \(\rho(7\) K\()=0.3\) m\(\Omega\) cm, just above the superconducting transition. This yields a mean free path of 2.1 nm [40], with a coherence length of \(\xi=5.5\) nm deduced from the upper critical field, and a Sommerfeld coefficient of \(\gamma_{n}=27.4\) mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) from our specific heat measurements described below. The calculated mean free path is less than half the coherence length, indicating that the sample is closer to the dirty limit. The inset of Fig. 1(a) displays an enlargement of \(\rho(T)\) at low temperatures, where a sharp superconducting transition occurs at \(T_{c}=6.8\) K, with a transition width less than 0.2 K. In addition, the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility in Fig. 1(b) shows that the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) curve exhibits full diamagnetism, providing evidence for bulk superconductivity in the Re\({}_{6}\)Zr single crystals.

Figure 2 displays the temperature dependence of the penetration depth shift \(\Delta\lambda(T)\) at low temperatures from TDO-based measurements. The frequency change \(\Delta f(T)\) is plotted in the inset from about 7.5 K down to the base temperature of 0.35 K, which has been normalized by the normal state value. Here a sharp superconducting transition occurs at around 6.8 K, in line with the resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. \(\Delta\lambda(T)\) decreases rapidly upon reducing the temperature, before becoming flat below around 1.5 K, indicating a fully open superconducting gap in Re\({}_{6}\)Zr. For an \(s\)-wave superconductor,

The inset of (a) shows an enlargement of \(\rho(T)\) around \(T_{c}=6.8\) K.

  the change of magnetic penetration depth shows exponentially activated behavior at \(T\ll T_{c}\), as

\[\Delta\lambda(T)=\lambda(0)\Bigg{[}\sqrt{\frac{\pi\,\Delta(0)}{2k_{B}T}}\exp\! \left(-\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T}\right)\Bigg{]},\] (1)

where \(\lambda(0)\) and \(\Delta(0)\) are the penetration depth and superconducting gap magnitude at zero temperature, respectively. As shown by the solid red line, our experimental data can be well described by a single \(s\)-wave gap with \(\lambda(0)=200\) nm and \(\Delta(0)=1.96\)\(k_{B}T_{c}\). The value of \(\lambda(0)\) and the temperature dependence of \(\Delta\lambda(T)\) are comparable with those in Ref. [29], suggesting that both single crystal and polycrystalline samples are consistent with a similar nodeless gap structure. We note that for a superconductor with line nodes in the dirty limit, a quadratic dependence would be expected at low temperatures instead of a linear \(\Delta\lambda(T)\)[41]. However, upon analyzing with a power-law dependence \(\Delta\lambda(T)\propto T^{n}\), values of \(n\) of 4.4 and 6.1 are obtained fitting from the base temperature up to 3 and 2.2 K, respectively. Since these exponents are significantly larger than two, such a dirty nodal scenario can be ruled out.

Moreover the magnetic penetration depth was also converted into the normalized superfluid density via \(\rho_{s}=[\lambda(0)/\lambda(T)]^{2}\), which is displayed as a function of the reduced temperature \(T/T_{c}\) in Fig. 3. For a clean superconductor, \(\rho_{s}(T)\) can be calculated using

\[\rho_{\rm c}(T)=1+2\Bigg{\langle}\!\int_{\Delta_{k}}^{\infty}\frac{EdE}{\sqrt {E^{2}-\Delta_{k}^{2}}}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\Bigg{\rangle}_{\rm FS}\ ,\] (2)

where \(f(E,T)=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1}\) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the superconducting gap function is defined as \(\Delta_{k}(T)=\Delta(T)g_{k}\). This contains an angular dependent part \(g_{k}\) and a temperature dependent component \(\Delta(T)\), which can be approximated as \(\Delta(T)=\Delta(0)\)tanh\(\{1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T-1)]^{0.51}\}\)[42]. Here the zero temperature gap magnitude \(\Delta(0)\) is the only fitted parameter. As shown by the green dashed-dotted line in Fig. 3, a single gap \(s\)-wave model with \(g_{k}=1\) can well reproduce the experimental data with \(\Delta(0)=2.23\)\(k_{B}T_{c}\). This gap magnitude is larger than the value of 1.76 \(k_{B}T_{c}\) for weakly coupled BCS superconductors, suggesting moderately strong coupling in Re\({}_{6}\)Zr. On the other hand, since as discussed above the samples are near to the dirty limit, a dirty \(s\)-wave model was also applied, where \(\rho_{s}(T)=\frac{\Delta(T)}{\Delta(0)}\)tanh\(\frac{\Delta(T)}{2k_{B}T}\)[43]. The results are shown by the solid red line, which also well accounts for the experimental data with \(\Delta(0)=2.1\)\(k_{B}T_{c}\). In order to compare with nodal superconducting scenarios, both a \(p\)-wave model with \(g_{k}=\) sin\(\theta\) and a \(d\)-wave model \(g_{k}=\) cos\(2\phi\) are also displayed, where \(\theta\) is the polar angle and \(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle. It is obvious that the superfluid density of \(p\)- and \(d\)-wave superconductors change significantly with temperature, even at very low temperatures, which is in contrast with the data showing near temperature independence below around 0.25 \(T_{c}\). Furthermore, we also compare our results with measurements of polycrystalline samples using transverse-field muon-spin rotation (\(\mu\)SR) measurements from Ref. [27]. These are displayed in Fig. 3 and show that comparable superconducting gap structures are inferred from measurements of single crystal and polycrystalline samples.

The specific heat measurements of Re\({}_{6}\)Zr single crystals were also analyzed to further characterize the superconducting order parameter. In the inset of Fig. 4, the total specific heat as \(C/T\) is displayed, which contains both electronic and phonon contributions. In the normal state, the data were fitted using \(C(T)=\gamma_{n}T+\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5}\), where \(C_{e}=\gamma_{n}T\) and \(C_{\rm ph}=\beta T^{3}+\delta T^{5}\) represent the electron and phonon contributions, respectively, and \(\gamma_{n}\) is the Sommerfeld coefficient. The fitting

The black squares are the data from this work, while the dots are from \(\mu\)SR results in Ref. [27]. The lines show the superfluid density calculated from various models of the gap structure.

Figure 2: Temperature dependence of the penetration depth shift \(\Delta\lambda(T)\) at low temperatures, where exponential behavior is observed. The solid red line displays the fitted curve for an \(s\)-wave model with \(\Delta(0)=1.96\)\(k_{B}T_{c}\). The inset shows the frequency shift from 7.5 down to 0.35 K, normalized by the 7 K value, which displays a sharp superconducting transition at \(T_{c}=6.8\) K.

  results are shown by the dashed line with fitted parameters of \(\beta=0.39\) mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-4}\), \(\delta=1\)\(\mu\)J mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-6}\), and \(\gamma_{n}=27.4\) mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\), which are consistent with measurements of polycrystalline samples [27].

The main panel of Fig. 4 displays the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat as \(C_{e}/T\) in the superconducting state after subtracting the phonon contribution. A sizable jump is observed around \(T_{c}\) of \(\Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c}=1.76\), which is larger than the value of 1.43 for a weakly coupled BCS superconductor, again indicating an enhancement of the coupling strength in Re\({}_{6}\)Zr. In the superconducting state, the entropy \(S\) can be expressed as [44]

\[S=-\frac{3\gamma_{n}}{\pi^{3}}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}[f\ln f+(1-f)\ln( 1-f)]d\varepsilon d\phi\] (3)

and therefore the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state can be calculated as \(C_{e}=TdS/dT\). Due to \(C_{e}(T)/T\) becoming flat with decreasing temperature for \(T\ll T_{c}\), the data were fitted using an isotropic \(s\)-wave model, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 by the solid red line. It can be clearly seen that this model well describes the experimental data, with a fitted parameter of \(\Delta(0)=1.95\)\(k_{B}T_{c}\). This is consistent with the penetration depth and superfluid density results and also indicates a moderately enhanced superconducting gap magnitude.

Since Re\({}_{6}\)Zr is a NCS, the ASOC will lift the spin degeneracy of the electron bands, which can potentially give rise to a mixture of spin singlet and spin triplet pairing states, leading to a two-gap structure \(\Delta_{\pm}=\psi\pm|\mathbf{d}|\), where \(\psi\) and \(\mathbf{d}\) represent the singlet and triplet components [1]. Therefore the experimental results being consistent with a single nodeless gap implies that the spin triplet component is very small relative to the spin singlet. The origin of TRS breaking in Re\({}_{6}\)Zr still remains difficult to account for. In LaNiC\({}_{2}\), because of the low symmetry of the orthorhombic crystal structure, the breaking of TRS at \(T_{c}\) implies that singlet-triplet mixing is weak, and moreover that the pairing corresponds to a nonunitary triplet state [36, 37]. Here the lack of a role played by ASOC was corroborated by the breaking of TRS in the similar but centrosymmetric LaNiGa\({}_{2}\)[45], and the observation of two-gap superconductivity in both LaNiC\({}_{2}\) and LaNiGa\({}_{2}\) allowed for the proposal of a nodeless even-parity, nonunitary triplet state, where the overall pairing wave function is antisymmetric upon particle exchange due to an antisymmetric orbital index [46]. Such a scenario is not readily applied to Re\({}_{6}\)Zr, since the higher symmetry of the cubic \(\alpha\)-Mn crystal structure lifts the constraint that TRS breaking at \(T_{c}\) must correspond to nonunitary pairing, and moreover most studies only show evidence for single-gap behavior. As the symmetry analysis of Re\({}_{6}\)Zr also allows for mixed singlet-triplet pairing with broken TRS [27], further studies are highly desirable to understand the origin of TRS breaking and the role of the ASOC in the superconducting state of Re\({}_{6}\)Zr.

## IV Conclusions

To summarize, we have measured the magnetic penetration depth and electronic specific heat of single crystals of the non-centrosymmetric superconductor Re\({}_{6}\)Zr. Exponential behavior of \(\Delta\lambda(T)\) was observed at \(T\ll T_{c}\), which indicates the absence of low energy excitations, and a fully gapped superconducting state. Both the superfluid density and specific heat can be well accounted for by a single gap \(s\)-wave model across the whole temperature range with a gap magnitude larger than the weak coupling BCS value, providing strong evidence for fully gapped superconductivity with moderately strong coupling in Re\({}_{6}\)Zr.
