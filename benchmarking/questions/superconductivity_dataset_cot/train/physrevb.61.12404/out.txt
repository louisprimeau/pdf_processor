###### Abstract

We present results of a comparative study of the normal-state and superconducting properties in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with substitutions by Pr for the R and Ba sites. The temperature dependences of the resistivity and thermopower were measured for the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} (_x_ = 0.0-0.35) samples and analyzed in comparison with data for the Y_{1-y}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. It was observed that the Pr\rightarrowBa substitution affects all the properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, both the normal state and superconducting, much stronger compared to the Pr\rightarrowY one. This manifests itself in an increasing oxygen content, an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition at x = 0.3-0.35, a stronger rise of the thermopower value, and a faster T_{c} drop. The results obtained are analyzed within a phenomenological narrow-band model in order to reveal both common peculiarities and specific features of the Pr influence on the band spectrum parameters in the normal state when substituting for different lattice positions. We have observed that the Pr doping leads to a significant modification of the band spectrum, resulting in a strong band broadening and states localization. At the same time, changes of the total effective width of the conduction band W_{D} and the T_{c} value in two systems with the different kind of Pr doping are shown to correspond to each other so that the T_{c}(W_{D}) dependence follows the universal correlation for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with different deviations from stoichiometry. Based on our analysis and in agreement with earlier suggestions, we conclude that the superconductivity suppression in both Pr-doped systems could be mainly attributed to the hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states. In addition, Pr in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} on the Ba site acts like other trivalent rare-earth impurities inducing the extra hole filling effect that leads to a stronger T_{c} suppression compared to Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y}.

## I Introduction

Among different elements substituting for the native cations in the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y}-type high-T_{c} superconductors (HTSC's) Pr has attracted much attention (for a general review, see Ref. [1]). It was widely reported that despite the fact that PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} is orthorhombic and isostructural to RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} (R is Y or a rare-earth element except Ce and Tb), the former compound does not exhibit superconductivity.[2, 3, 4] With increasing Pr doping in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} the critical temperature decreases and goes to zero at x_{c} = 0.55.[2, 5]

Numerous studies have been performed to investigate both the normal-state and superconducting properties of the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system and to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the suppression of superconductivity. Several possible models have been earlier proposed, such as (i) the hole filling effect arising from the valence of the Pr ion which could be much greater than 3+,[4, 6, 7] (ii) the pair-breaking model suggesting that superconductivity is destroyed due to the interaction of the Pr magnetic moments and the spin of the mobile holes,[8, 9, 10] (iii) the effect of the hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states which leads to the localization of the charge carriers or to significant changes in the band structure.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15] In most of recent papers it is argued that the T_{c} suppression is mainly caused by the hybridization effect[16, 17, 18, 19, 20] or, at least, by a coexistence of the pair-breaking and hybridization effects.[21] A recent short review presenting the arguments in favor of the hybridization model can be found in Ref. [22].

We have previously performed an analysis of the normal-state transport properties for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system within a narrow-band model.[23] This model was shown to allow one to estimate the main band spectrum parameters, to trace their transformation with increasing doping level in the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, and to compare the modification of the conduction band with varying superconducting properties.[24, 25, 26, 27] Applying this model to the Pr-doped samples we have come to the conclusion that the main reason for the superconductivity suppression is rather to be a strong modification of the conduction band caused by praseodymium.[23]

It was recently reported by several groups about successful preparation of single-phase RBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} samples where Pr substitutes for the Ba site.[28, 29, 30, 31, 32] In this case Pr obviously being a nonisovalent impurity is expected to decrease the mobile hole concentration. There are two main questions to be answered: (i) whether or not the Pr ion on the Ba site affects the normal-state and superconducting properties of the RBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system like other trivalent rare-earth ions (for example, La), and (ii) whether or not the hybridization effect is realized when Pr substitutes for Ba. For this reason a comparative study of the R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and RBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system is of considerable interest due  to a possibility to investigate the Pr effect when it acts as either an isovalent or a nonisovalent impurity. At present, the question on different and common features of the Pr\rightarrow_R_ and Pr\rightarrowBa substitutions undoubtedly calls for further investigations because of a lack of experimental results on the Pr substitution for the Ba site.

The purpose of the present work is to perform a comparative analysis of the normal-state resistivity and thermopower as well as of the superconducting properties of the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems. The results obtained for the last system will be interpreted in the framework of a narrow-band model. Using this approach, we will analyze the band spectrum transformation and the variation of the critical temperature in the case of Pr\rightarrowBa doping in comparison with those obtained earlier for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. [23] Based on these results we will discuss the role of Pr ions on different sites in the _R_Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} lattice as well as both common peculiarities and specific features of the superconductivity suppression by Pr when substituting for the R and Ba sites.

## II Samples and experimental details

We have investigated the normal-state transport properties of SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} (_x_ = 0.0-0.35) ceramic samples. The samples were prepared by the standard solid-state processing technique from the high-purity respective carbonates and oxides mixed in required proportions. The mixtures were heated at T = 950 ^{\circ}C for 24 h, reground, pressed into pellets and then sintered two or three times at T = 950-970 ^{\circ}C for 24 h with intermediate reginding. Finally, the products were annealed in flowing oxygen at T = 450 ^{\circ}C for 24 h and slowly furnace cooled down to room temperature.

X-ray-diffraction analysis was used to characterize the samples' purity and to determine the lattice parameters. The oxygen content was determined by the iodometric titration technique with an accuracy of +-0.01-0.02. All the samples were of single phase with the foreign impurity level less than 1-2%. The oxygen content and the lattice parameters as a function of doping are presented in Table 1. Comparing these results with the data for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y}, one can see that substitutions by Pr for the Y and Ba sites influence all these parameters in a different way. In the case of Pr on the Y site the oxygen content is almost constant with doping level and the orthorhombic symmetry retains for all the samples up to x = 0.6. [82, 33, 34] Contrary to this, in the case of Pr on the Ba site the oxygen content increases gradually with x and an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition was observed at x = 0.30-0.35. Note that analogous lattice transformation and oxygen content change were observed in the NdBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. [28, 29, 31] The revealed difference in the Pr effect on structural properties of the _R_Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system can be considered as an additional evidence that in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system presacoymium indeed substitutes for Ba. In this connection it is necessary to note that substitutions for Ba by trivalent rare-earth elements, for instance, by either La or Eu, [26, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] lead to the same lattice transformation and oxygen content change. Thus Pr on the Ba site seems to influence the sample structure like other trivalent ions.

The resistivity and thermopower were measured in the temperature range of T = T _{c}-300 K. The resistivity measurements were performed by the standard four-probe low-frequency ac (20 Hz) method. The thermopower was measured relative to copper electrodes and then calculated by correcting for the thermopower of copper. The temperature difference between the two ends of the sample was kept around 1-2 K throughout the measuring procedure.

## III Experimental results

The temperature dependences of the normalized resistivity for SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} are shown in Fig. 1. Peculiarities of the _r_(_T_) dependence including its transformation with deviations from stoichiometry are typical for the HTSC materials. For the undoped sample the _r_(_T_) curve is metallic-like, while for heavily doped samples the resistivity at low temperature demonstrates a semiconductorlike behavior. Note, that the Pr influence on the _r_(_T_) transformation in the case of substitution for the Ba site is stronger compared to that for the Y site so that the metallic-semiconductor transition takes place at x \sim 0.15 for the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system and at x \approx 0.4 for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. [23] The critical temperature _T__{c} was determined as the midpoint of the resistive superconducting transition. The _T__{c} variation with doping level for the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system in comparison with that for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one (taken from Ref. 23) is shown in Fig. 2. In the case of the Pr\rightarrowY substitution _T__{c} decreases slightly in the range of x = 0.0-0.1, goes down faster as the doping level increases further, and the superconductivity vanishes at the Pr content of x = 0.5-0.6. The Pr\rightarrowBa substitution affects the superconducting properties much stronger and, as a result, the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system becomes nonsuperconducting at the Pr content of x \approx 0.3. To compare the influence of the Pr ion placed at dif

  ferent sites of the lattice, it is necessary to take into account the data on the rare-earth R ion-size effect on T_{c} in the R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. It was well-established that T_{c} at a given Pr content and a critical Pr content corresponding to the superconductivity disappearance in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} decrease almost linearly with increasing radius of the R ion.[18, 20, 40, 41, 42, 43] To explain this finding, authors of Refs. [18, 20], and [41] suggest that the hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states enhances as the R ion radius increases that results in a stronger superconductivity suppression. Since the Sm ion radius is larger then the Y one, the T_{c} value even in the Sm_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system should drop faster compared to the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. Using the data mentioned above we have plotted in Fig. 2 the T_{c}(x) dependence for the Sm_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system together with our data. It can be seen that the observed drop of T_{c} in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} is even faster than it should be in case of Pr\rightarrowSm substitution. This fact clearly indicates that in the case of Pr\rightarrowBa substitution Pr has a twofold effect on T_{c} . In addition to the hybridization of 4f Pr states with band states praseodymium acts as an nonisovalent impurity and, as a result of two of these mechanisms, T_{c} in the Sm_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system falls much faster. Note that this conclusion is in a good agreement with results of Colonescu _et al.[28]_ They have found that in the case of the insulating Nd_{0.7}Pr_{0.3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} sample (where superconductivity is suppressed by the hybridization) substitution by Ca for Nd fails to restore superconductivity, whereas in the NdBa_{1.7}Pr_{0.3}Cu_{3}O_{y} compound (which is also an insulator, but, in addition, due to the hole-filling effect) the same substitution raises the T_{c} value from zero to 31 K. These results have nicely shown that the suppression of superconductivity when the Pr ion occupies the Ba site may not result solely from the hybridization effect.

The temperature dependences of the thermopower are shown in Fig. 3. They demonstrate the well-known characteristic features of the thermopower behavior in the doped RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system (Ref. [44]) being qualitatively analogous, in their main peculiarities, to those for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system.[23] For slightly doped samples the thermopower is almost temperature independent at T>150-200 K depending on sample composition. With increasing doping level the S(T) dependence at high temperatures becomes stronger. Besides, all the S(T) curves show a well-pronounced maximum at a temperature above the superconducting transition which shifts towards higher temperatures with increasing doping level. On the other hand, the incorporation of praseodymium into the Y or Ba sites affects the thermopower to a different extent. To demonstrate this, the variation of the thermopower value at T=300 K, S_{300}, with the Pr content for the Sm_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems is shown in Fig. 4. With increasing Pr content the S_{300} value increases slightly in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} , but rises extremely strongly in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} compared to other substitutions in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system reaching the value of about 120 \muV/K at x=0.35. In fact, this result can be considered as the direct evidence for the hole filling effect in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system realized due to a higher valence of Pr compared to that of Ba. Thus the difference between the S_{300} variation for cases of different kinds of Pr doping is caused by different relation between the valences of Pr and substituted elements.

Before analyzing the results obtained, we would like to mention one more experimental fact. Comparing the S(T) dependence for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} (see Ref. [23]) and SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} (see Fig. 3) systems, one can observe that the S_{300} values for the sample with x= 0.4 for the first case and x= 0.1 for the second one as well as for x= 0.6 and

  x\!=\!0.2, respectively, are equal. Moreover, even the S(T) dependences for those couples of samples are very close to each other excluding a temperature region in the vicinity of the superconducting transition. But in both cases the T_{c} value for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} sample is less then for SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} (31.5 K for x\!=\!0.4 and 57 K for x\!=\!0.1 for the first couple of samples and <4 K for x\!=\!0.6 and 27 K for x\!=\!0.2 for the second one). This fact will be discussed below.

Summarizing the experimental results, we have observed that the Pr\rightarrowBa substitution affects all the properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, both the normal-state and superconducting, much stronger compared to the Pr\rightarrowY one. Below we will analyze the normal-state transport properties on the basis of our phenomenological band spectrum model and compare the results obtained here on SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} with those for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} .[23]

## IV Discussion

To obtain the information on the conduction-band transformation in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} , we have used a narrow-band model described in detail in Ref. [24]. Note, that various models have been proposed in order to describe the thermopower behavior in HTSC materials. Different authors have considered both single.[45, 46, 47, 48] and two-band pictures,[49, 50, 51, 52] analyzed the thermopower taking into account the presence of the van Hove singularity near the Fermi level,[53] the phonon drag effect,[54, 55] and a bosonic contribution to the S(T) dependences.[56, 57] The question on validity of these models is still under discussion. It was demonstrated by different groups that several models, including the model we use, can reasonably fit the experimental S(T) curves for both Y- and Bi-based HTSC's.[58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64] However, some of those models contain parameters having no clear physical interpretation. Besides, when applying those models to doped HTSC's, the parameters show, in some cases, no systematic variation or the values of them for some sample compositions look to be rather unphysical.[58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 1  agreement with the results of other authors [16, 17] who proposed that in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, though Pr is predominantly trivalent, an admixture of Pr^{4+} of about 10% exists.

Figure 5 shows that the F value in the case of the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system increases with doping level much stronger than in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one, and, at the same time, the F(x) dependence is close to that for the YBa_{2-x}La_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. [26] Thus both the structural changes (increasing oxygen content, an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition) and the band filling variations in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} and YBa_{2-x}La_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems are analogous to each other. These facts make it possible to conclude that Pr on the Ba site has a valence of 3+ and acts like other nonisovalent rare-earth impurities.

The concentration dependences of the total effective bandwidth W_{D} and the "conductivity" effective bandwidth W_{\sigma} for Pr-doped samples are shown in Fig. 6. Before analyzing them, let us note that according to our previous results the variation of the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio with changing sample composition characterizes the variation of the degree of the charge carriers localization in the band. [24] It can be seen that an increase in Pr content leads to an essential broadening of the conduction band in both Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} accompanied by a gradual and strong rise of the localization degree (the decrease of the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio). In the latter system the band broadening is extremely strong compared to other substitutions in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y}[24, 26, 38] and, as a result, even for the sample with x\!=\!0.2W_{D} reaches the value of about 500 meV. To interpret these data, it is necessary to mention that in the framework of our model the reason for such a modification of the band spectrum is assumed to be the Anderson localization of the states [66] caused by a lattice disordering induced by substitutions for the native cations. As it was shown in Refs. [24, 26], and [38] in cases of different nonisovalent substitutions or an increasing oxygen deficit, the main reason for the band broadening and the localization of the states is a redistribution of oxygen atoms induced by an impurity and resulting in an oxygen subsystem disordering. Such a disordering does not occur, however, in the case of the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system because the Pr\rightarrowY substitution has practically no effect on the oxygen content and the oxygen subsystem as a whole. [23] This fact allowed us earlier to conclude that the modification of the conduction band in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system is caused by the direct impact of the Pr impurity. [23] These results give support to the conclusion that the reason for the band spectrum modification with Pr doping is the hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states accompanied by a strong localization of the states. [16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 67]

Further, as one can see in Fig. 6, the bandwidth and the degree of the states localization rise with increasing doping in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system much faster compared to the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. This is a result of a simultaneous effect of two mechanisms. First, as noted above Pr on the Ba site acts as a trivalent rare-earth impurity. If so, this should cause, in agreement with our previous results, both the band broadening and states localization. The incorporation of the Pr ions into the Ba sites induces a disordering of the oxygen subsystem that can be confirmed by an increasing oxygen content and a transition to the tetragonal symmetry (see Table 1). However, comparing our results on the La^{3+}\rightarrowBa^{2+} substitution [26] with the case of the Pr\rightarrowBa one we can conclude that Pr has more essential effect upon the degree of the states localization and the effective bandwidth than the trivalent La ion has. For example, in the YBa_{2-x}La_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system in the range of x\!=\!0.0\!-\!0.2 a broadening of the band is less than 50 meV and the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio changes by a factor of 1.5, while the W_{D} variation in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system in the same impurity range is about 400 meV and the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio changes by about 2.5 times. Consequently, one can conclude that on the background of the oxygen subsystem disordering induced by the Ba-site Pr effect, the hybridization of Pr 4f states with conduction-band states in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system also takes place, like in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. Moreover, as it was shown in Ref. [18] this hybridization is stronger in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system compared to the YBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} one because of the difference between the Sm and Y ionic radii. Thus, due to the combination of two of those types of the Pr influence, the localization of the mobile holes in the case of the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system should be much stronger than in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. Our results give a strong support to this point of view. As one can see in Fig. 6, the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio decreases with doping much faster in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} implying a more essential increase in the localization degree. In this connection, we would like to note that the stronger localization of the states in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system compared to the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one revealed by our analysis of the S(T) dependences correlates well with the stronger \rho(T) transformation [for example, as noted above, a transition to a semiconductorlike \rho(T) behavior at low temperatures in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} takes place at lower Pr content].

By such a way, an increase in the Pr content in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system results in a very strong band spectrum modification, namely, the conduction-band broadening and the localization of the states at the edges of the band. In this connection let us discuss the transformation of the S(T) dependences in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} and Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems. As shown in Ref. [23] and noted above, the charge-carrier concentration in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system (or, in other words, the band filling in our model) depends slightly on the Pr content. In this case rising the slope of the S(T) curves in the range of T\sim\!150\!-\!300 K accompanied by increasing S_{300} is caused, in

Figure 6: Effective bandwidth W_{D} and conductivity bandwidth W_{\sigma} vs Pr content in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} in comparison with the data for Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} (Ref. [23]).

  the framework of our model, by a gradual increase of the state's localization degree (the decrease of the W_{\alpha}/W_{D} ratio).[24] At the same time, a domorlike character of the Pr^{3+}\rightarrowBa^{2+} substitution results in the essential rise of the S_{300} value with doping level in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, on whose background the influence of a strong states localization on the S(T) curves shape becomes less pronounced. Taking into account these different reasons for the S(T) transformation in the investigated systems, one can explain the noted above fact that for the samples of the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems with the same S_{300} value T_{c} is higher in the first case. Indeed, it is obvious that the hybridization effect resulting in the strong band broadening should affect the T_{c} value stronger compared to the hole filling effect. On the other hand, the hole filling effect leads to a stronger S_{300} rise. As a result, the same S_{300} value is reached by the Pr\rightarrowBa substitution at a lower Pr content than by the Pr\rightarrowY one (see Fig. 4). It is clear that T_{c} in the first case should be higher in agreement with our experimental results.

Finally, let us discuss the common reason for the superconductivity suppression in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with different deviations from stoichiometry. The data presented in Figs. 2 and 6 show that a stronger band broadening in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system is accompanied by a faster T_{c} drop. We would like to note, that analyzing the band spectrum transformation in the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with increasing oxygen deficit[24] as well as under different nonisovalent substitutions[24, 26] including the codoped system[68] we have concluded that there is the universal correlation between the effective bandwidth and the critical temperature value. The existence of such a correlation can be easily understood qualitatively. It is clear that doping cannot lead (at least in most cases) to an increase of the total number of states in the band. If so, a broadening of the band has to be accompanied by decreasing value of the DOS function at the Fermi level. The latter can be considered as the major reason for the T_{c} decrease. Thus the modification of the band spectrum in the normal state influences the superconducting properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. For this reason it was interesting to check the presence of the T_{c}(W_{D}) correlation in the case of Pr-doped samples. Results of this checking are shown in Fig. 7 together with the data for other doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems taken from our previous publications. As one can see the T_{c}(W_{D}) dependence for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems also follows the universal correlation.[68] Note, that this finding points again to a slighter effect of the hole filling on the superconducting properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system compared to the band broadening. On the other hand, this fact can be considered as an evidence for the conclusion that praseodymium affects the superconducting properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system due to its influence on the band spectrum modification, i.e., like other nonisovalent impurities. A specific role of the Pr impurity manifests itself in the fact that due to an effect of the states hybridization praseodymium affects the structure of the conduction band drastically, inducing the strong band broadening accompanied by the strong states localization. Let us note that in the case of Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} substitution for Ba_{2} by BaSr and heat treating the samples in argon prior to oxygenation was demonstrated to increase the critical Pr content x_{c} to 0.7,[69] which seems to rule out the pair-breaking mechanism as the main course of the T_{c} suppression and to support therefore our point of view, as well as the conclusion drawn in Ref. [22].

## V Conclusions

In summary, the results obtained and the comparative analysis of the band spectrum transformation in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems based on the interpretation of the thermopower data in the framework of the narrow-band model allow us to draw the following conclusions.

(i) The substitution by Pr for the Ba site affects the properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system much stronger compared to the Pr\rightarrowR one resulting in the increasing oxygen content, appearance of an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition, a stronger rise of the thermopower, and a faster T_{c} drop.

(ii) The Pr\rightarrowY substitution affects very slightly the total number of electrons in the conduction band due to the fact that the valence of the Pr ion in the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system is close to 3+. To the contrary, in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system the nonisovalent Pr\rightarrowBa substitution results in the hole filling effect, and the Pr ion on the Ba site influences the charge-carrier concentration like other rare-earth impurities placed at the Ba site.

(iii) In both kinds of Pr doping praseodymium has a remarkable effect on the conduction-band transformation inducing the strong band broadening accompanied by the strong states localization. Such an influence can be attributed to the effect of the hybridization between 4f states of Pr ion and the conduction-band states. In the case of the Pr\rightarrowBa substitution a random ordering of the excess oxygen caused by a higher valence of Pr compared to Ba leads to an additional band broadening and localization of the states.

(iv) Despite a different extent of the Pr influence on the band spectrum and the critical temperature in the

  Y1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3Oy and SmBa2-_x_PrxCu3Oy systems, the T_{c}(W_{D}) dependence for these systems follows the universal correlation for different substitutions in YBa2Cu3Oy. The main reason for the superconductivity suppression by praseodymium in both systems is the modification of the band spectrum caused by the Pr introducing into the lattice.

###### Abstract

We present results of a comparative study of the normal-state and superconducting properties in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with substitutions by Pr for the R and Ba sites. The temperature dependences of the resistivity and thermopower were measured for the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} (_x_ = 0.0-0.35) samples and analyzed in comparison with data for the Y_{1-y}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. It was observed that the Pr\rightarrowBa substitution affects all the properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, both the normal state and superconducting, much stronger compared to the Pr\rightarrowY one. This manifests itself in an increasing oxygen content, an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition at x = 0.3-0.35, a stronger rise of the thermopower value, and a faster T_{c} drop. The results obtained are analyzed within a phenomenological narrow-band model in order to reveal both common peculiarities and specific features of the Pr influence on the band spectrum parameters in the normal state when substituting for different lattice positions. We have observed that the Pr doping leads to a significant modification of the band spectrum, resulting in a strong band broadening and states localization. At the same time, changes of the total effective width of the conduction band W_{D} and the T_{c} value in two systems with the different kind of Pr doping are shown to correspond to each other so that the T_{c}(W_{D}) dependence follows the universal correlation for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with different deviations from stoichiometry. Based on our analysis and in agreement with earlier suggestions, we conclude that the superconductivity suppression in both Pr-doped systems could be mainly attributed to the hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states. In addition, Pr in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} on the Ba site acts like other trivalent rare-earth impurities inducing the extra hole filling effect that leads to a stronger T_{c} suppression compared to Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y}.

## I Introduction

Among different elements substituting for the native cations in the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y}-type high-T_{c} superconductors (HTSC's) Pr has attracted much attention (for a general review, see Ref. [1]). It was widely reported that despite the fact that PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} is orthorhombic and isostructural to RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} (R is Y or a rare-earth element except Ce and Tb), the former compound does not exhibit superconductivity.[2, 3, 4] With increasing Pr doping in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} the critical temperature decreases and goes to zero at x_{c} = 0.55.[2, 5]

Numerous studies have been performed to investigate both the normal-state and superconducting properties of the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system and to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the suppression of superconductivity. Several possible models have been earlier proposed, such as (i) the hole filling effect arising from the valence of the Pr ion which could be much greater than 3+,[4, 6, 7] (ii) the pair-breaking model suggesting that superconductivity is destroyed due to the interaction of the Pr magnetic moments and the spin of the mobile holes,[8, 9, 10] (iii) the effect of the hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states which leads to the localization of the charge carriers or to significant changes in the band structure.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15] In most of recent papers it is argued that the T_{c} suppression is mainly caused by the hybridization effect[16, 17, 18, 19, 20] or, at least, by a coexistence of the pair-breaking and hybridization effects.[21] A recent short review presenting the arguments in favor of the hybridization model can be found in Ref. [22].

We have previously performed an analysis of the normal-state transport properties for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system within a narrow-band model.[23] This model was shown to allow one to estimate the main band spectrum parameters, to trace their transformation with increasing doping level in the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, and to compare the modification of the conduction band with varying superconducting properties.[24, 25, 26, 27] Applying this model to the Pr-doped samples we have come to the conclusion that the main reason for the superconductivity suppression is rather to be a strong modification of the conduction band caused by praseodymium.[23]

It was recently reported by several groups about successful preparation of single-phase RBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} samples where Pr substitutes for the Ba site.[28, 29, 30, 31, 32] In this case Pr obviously being a nonisovalent impurity is expected to decrease the mobile hole concentration. There are two main questions to be answered: (i) whether or not the Pr ion on the Ba site affects the normal-state and superconducting properties of the RBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system like other trivalent rare-earth ions (for example, La), and (ii) whether or not the hybridization effect is realized when Pr substitutes for Ba. For this reason a comparative study of the R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and RBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system is of considerable interest due  to a possibility to investigate the Pr effect when it acts as either an isovalent or a nonisovalent impurity. At present, the question on different and common features of the Pr\rightarrow_R_ and Pr\rightarrowBa substitutions undoubtedly calls for further investigations because of a lack of experimental results on the Pr substitution for the Ba site.

The purpose of the present work is to perform a comparative analysis of the normal-state resistivity and thermopower as well as of the superconducting properties of the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems. The results obtained for the last system will be interpreted in the framework of a narrow-band model. Using this approach, we will analyze the band spectrum transformation and the variation of the critical temperature in the case of Pr\rightarrowBa doping in comparison with those obtained earlier for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. [23] Based on these results we will discuss the role of Pr ions on different sites in the _R_Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} lattice as well as both common peculiarities and specific features of the superconductivity suppression by Pr when substituting for the R and Ba sites.

## II Samples and experimental details

We have investigated the normal-state transport properties of SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} (_x_ = 0.0-0.35) ceramic samples. The samples were prepared by the standard solid-state processing technique from the high-purity respective carbonates and oxides mixed in required proportions. The mixtures were heated at T = 950 ^{\circ}C for 24 h, reground, pressed into pellets and then sintered two or three times at T = 950-970 ^{\circ}C for 24 h with intermediate reginding. Finally, the products were annealed in flowing oxygen at T = 450 ^{\circ}C for 24 h and slowly furnace cooled down to room temperature.

X-ray-diffraction analysis was used to characterize the samples' purity and to determine the lattice parameters. The oxygen content was determined by the iodometric titration technique with an accuracy of +-0.01-0.02. All the samples were of single phase with the foreign impurity level less than 1-2%. The oxygen content and the lattice parameters as a function of doping are presented in Table 1. Comparing these results with the data for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y}, one can see that substitutions by Pr for the Y and Ba sites influence all these parameters in a different way. In the case of Pr on the Y site the oxygen content is almost constant with doping level and the orthorhombic symmetry retains for all the samples up to x = 0.6. [82, 33, 34] Contrary to this, in the case of Pr on the Ba site the oxygen content increases gradually with x and an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition was observed at x = 0.30-0.35. Note that analogous lattice transformation and oxygen content change were observed in the NdBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. [28, 29, 31] The revealed difference in the Pr effect on structural properties of the _R_Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system can be considered as an additional evidence that in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system presacoymium indeed substitutes for Ba. In this connection it is necessary to note that substitutions for Ba by trivalent rare-earth elements, for instance, by either La or Eu, [26, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] lead to the same lattice transformation and oxygen content change. Thus Pr on the Ba site seems to influence the sample structure like other trivalent ions.

The resistivity and thermopower were measured in the temperature range of T = T _{c}-300 K. The resistivity measurements were performed by the standard four-probe low-frequency ac (20 Hz) method. The thermopower was measured relative to copper electrodes and then calculated by correcting for the thermopower of copper. The temperature difference between the two ends of the sample was kept around 1-2 K throughout the measuring procedure.

## III Experimental results

The temperature dependences of the normalized resistivity for SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} are shown in Fig. 1. Peculiarities of the _r_(_T_) dependence including its transformation with deviations from stoichiometry are typical for the HTSC materials. For the undoped sample the _r_(_T_) curve is metallic-like, while for heavily doped samples the resistivity at low temperature demonstrates a semiconductorlike behavior. Note, that the Pr influence on the _r_(_T_) transformation in the case of substitution for the Ba site is stronger compared to that for the Y site so that the metallic-semiconductor transition takes place at x \sim 0.15 for the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system and at x \approx 0.4 for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. [23] The critical temperature _T__{c} was determined as the midpoint of the resistive superconducting transition. The _T__{c} variation with doping level for the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system in comparison with that for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one (taken from Ref. 23) is shown in Fig. 2. In the case of the Pr\rightarrowY substitution _T__{c} decreases slightly in the range of x = 0.0-0.1, goes down faster as the doping level increases further, and the superconductivity vanishes at the Pr content of x = 0.5-0.6. The Pr\rightarrowBa substitution affects the superconducting properties much stronger and, as a result, the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system becomes nonsuperconducting at the Pr content of x \approx 0.3. To compare the influence of the Pr ion placed at dif

  ferent sites of the lattice, it is necessary to take into account the data on the rare-earth R ion-size effect on T_{c} in the R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. It was well-established that T_{c} at a given Pr content and a critical Pr content corresponding to the superconductivity disappearance in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} decrease almost linearly with increasing radius of the R ion.[18, 20, 40, 41, 42, 43] To explain this finding, authors of Refs. [18, 20], and [41] suggest that the hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states enhances as the R ion radius increases that results in a stronger superconductivity suppression. Since the Sm ion radius is larger then the Y one, the T_{c} value even in the Sm_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system should drop faster compared to the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. Using the data mentioned above we have plotted in Fig. 2 the T_{c}(x) dependence for the Sm_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system together with our data. It can be seen that the observed drop of T_{c} in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} is even faster than it should be in case of Pr\rightarrowSm substitution. This fact clearly indicates that in the case of Pr\rightarrowBa substitution Pr has a twofold effect on T_{c} . In addition to the hybridization of 4f Pr states with band states praseodymium acts as an nonisovalent impurity and, as a result of two of these mechanisms, T_{c} in the Sm_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system falls much faster. Note that this conclusion is in a good agreement with results of Colonescu _et al.[28]_ They have found that in the case of the insulating Nd_{0.7}Pr_{0.3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} sample (where superconductivity is suppressed by the hybridization) substitution by Ca for Nd fails to restore superconductivity, whereas in the NdBa_{1.7}Pr_{0.3}Cu_{3}O_{y} compound (which is also an insulator, but, in addition, due to the hole-filling effect) the same substitution raises the T_{c} value from zero to 31 K. These results have nicely shown that the suppression of superconductivity when the Pr ion occupies the Ba site may not result solely from the hybridization effect.

The temperature dependences of the thermopower are shown in Fig. 3. They demonstrate the well-known characteristic features of the thermopower behavior in the doped RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system (Ref. [44]) being qualitatively analogous, in their main peculiarities, to those for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system.[23] For slightly doped samples the thermopower is almost temperature independent at T>150-200 K depending on sample composition. With increasing doping level the S(T) dependence at high temperatures becomes stronger. Besides, all the S(T) curves show a well-pronounced maximum at a temperature above the superconducting transition which shifts towards higher temperatures with increasing doping level. On the other hand, the incorporation of praseodymium into the Y or Ba sites affects the thermopower to a different extent. To demonstrate this, the variation of the thermopower value at T=300 K, S_{300}, with the Pr content for the Sm_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems is shown in Fig. 4. With increasing Pr content the S_{300} value increases slightly in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} , but rises extremely strongly in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} compared to other substitutions in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system reaching the value of about 120 \muV/K at x=0.35. In fact, this result can be considered as the direct evidence for the hole filling effect in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system realized due to a higher valence of Pr compared to that of Ba. Thus the difference between the S_{300} variation for cases of different kinds of Pr doping is caused by different relation between the valences of Pr and substituted elements.

Before analyzing the results obtained, we would like to mention one more experimental fact. Comparing the S(T) dependence for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} (see Ref. [23]) and SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} (see Fig. 3) systems, one can observe that the S_{300} values for the sample with x= 0.4 for the first case and x= 0.1 for the second one as well as for x= 0.6 and

  x\!=\!0.2, respectively, are equal. Moreover, even the S(T) dependences for those couples of samples are very close to each other excluding a temperature region in the vicinity of the superconducting transition. But in both cases the T_{c} value for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} sample is less then for SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} (31.5 K for x\!=\!0.4 and 57 K for x\!=\!0.1 for the first couple of samples and <4 K for x\!=\!0.6 and 27 K for x\!=\!0.2 for the second one). This fact will be discussed below.

Summarizing the experimental results, we have observed that the Pr\rightarrowBa substitution affects all the properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, both the normal-state and superconducting, much stronger compared to the Pr\rightarrowY one. Below we will analyze the normal-state transport properties on the basis of our phenomenological band spectrum model and compare the results obtained here on SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} with those for Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} .[23]

## IV Discussion

To obtain the information on the conduction-band transformation in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} , we have used a narrow-band model described in detail in Ref. [24]. Note, that various models have been proposed in order to describe the thermopower behavior in HTSC materials. Different authors have considered both single.[45, 46, 47, 48] and two-band pictures,[49, 50, 51, 52] analyzed the thermopower taking into account the presence of the van Hove singularity near the Fermi level,[53] the phonon drag effect,[54, 55] and a bosonic contribution to the S(T) dependences.[56, 57] The question on validity of these models is still under discussion. It was demonstrated by different groups that several models, including the model we use, can reasonably fit the experimental S(T) curves for both Y- and Bi-based HTSC's.[58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64] However, some of those models contain parameters having no clear physical interpretation. Besides, when applying those models to doped HTSC's, the parameters show, in some cases, no systematic variation or the values of them for some sample compositions look to be rather unphysical.[58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 1  agreement with the results of other authors [16, 17] who proposed that in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, though Pr is predominantly trivalent, an admixture of Pr^{4+} of about 10% exists.

Figure 5 shows that the F value in the case of the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system increases with doping level much stronger than in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one, and, at the same time, the F(x) dependence is close to that for the YBa_{2-x}La_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. [26] Thus both the structural changes (increasing oxygen content, an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition) and the band filling variations in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} and YBa_{2-x}La_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems are analogous to each other. These facts make it possible to conclude that Pr on the Ba site has a valence of 3+ and acts like other nonisovalent rare-earth impurities.

The concentration dependences of the total effective bandwidth W_{D} and the "conductivity" effective bandwidth W_{\sigma} for Pr-doped samples are shown in Fig. 6. Before analyzing them, let us note that according to our previous results the variation of the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio with changing sample composition characterizes the variation of the degree of the charge carriers localization in the band. [24] It can be seen that an increase in Pr content leads to an essential broadening of the conduction band in both Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} accompanied by a gradual and strong rise of the localization degree (the decrease of the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio). In the latter system the band broadening is extremely strong compared to other substitutions in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y}[24, 26, 38] and, as a result, even for the sample with x\!=\!0.2W_{D} reaches the value of about 500 meV. To interpret these data, it is necessary to mention that in the framework of our model the reason for such a modification of the band spectrum is assumed to be the Anderson localization of the states [66] caused by a lattice disordering induced by substitutions for the native cations. As it was shown in Refs. [24, 26], and [38] in cases of different nonisovalent substitutions or an increasing oxygen deficit, the main reason for the band broadening and the localization of the states is a redistribution of oxygen atoms induced by an impurity and resulting in an oxygen subsystem disordering. Such a disordering does not occur, however, in the case of the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system because the Pr\rightarrowY substitution has practically no effect on the oxygen content and the oxygen subsystem as a whole. [23] This fact allowed us earlier to conclude that the modification of the conduction band in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system is caused by the direct impact of the Pr impurity. [23] These results give support to the conclusion that the reason for the band spectrum modification with Pr doping is the hybridization between 4f states of the Pr ion and the conduction-band states accompanied by a strong localization of the states. [16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 67]

Further, as one can see in Fig. 6, the bandwidth and the degree of the states localization rise with increasing doping in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system much faster compared to the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. This is a result of a simultaneous effect of two mechanisms. First, as noted above Pr on the Ba site acts as a trivalent rare-earth impurity. If so, this should cause, in agreement with our previous results, both the band broadening and states localization. The incorporation of the Pr ions into the Ba sites induces a disordering of the oxygen subsystem that can be confirmed by an increasing oxygen content and a transition to the tetragonal symmetry (see Table 1). However, comparing our results on the La^{3+}\rightarrowBa^{2+} substitution [26] with the case of the Pr\rightarrowBa one we can conclude that Pr has more essential effect upon the degree of the states localization and the effective bandwidth than the trivalent La ion has. For example, in the YBa_{2-x}La_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system in the range of x\!=\!0.0\!-\!0.2 a broadening of the band is less than 50 meV and the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio changes by a factor of 1.5, while the W_{D} variation in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system in the same impurity range is about 400 meV and the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio changes by about 2.5 times. Consequently, one can conclude that on the background of the oxygen subsystem disordering induced by the Ba-site Pr effect, the hybridization of Pr 4f states with conduction-band states in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system also takes place, like in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. Moreover, as it was shown in Ref. [18] this hybridization is stronger in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system compared to the YBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} one because of the difference between the Sm and Y ionic radii. Thus, due to the combination of two of those types of the Pr influence, the localization of the mobile holes in the case of the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system should be much stronger than in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one. Our results give a strong support to this point of view. As one can see in Fig. 6, the W_{\sigma}/W_{D} ratio decreases with doping much faster in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} implying a more essential increase in the localization degree. In this connection, we would like to note that the stronger localization of the states in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system compared to the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} one revealed by our analysis of the S(T) dependences correlates well with the stronger \rho(T) transformation [for example, as noted above, a transition to a semiconductorlike \rho(T) behavior at low temperatures in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} takes place at lower Pr content].

By such a way, an increase in the Pr content in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system results in a very strong band spectrum modification, namely, the conduction-band broadening and the localization of the states at the edges of the band. In this connection let us discuss the transformation of the S(T) dependences in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} and Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems. As shown in Ref. [23] and noted above, the charge-carrier concentration in the Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system (or, in other words, the band filling in our model) depends slightly on the Pr content. In this case rising the slope of the S(T) curves in the range of T\sim\!150\!-\!300 K accompanied by increasing S_{300} is caused, in

Figure 6: Effective bandwidth W_{D} and conductivity bandwidth W_{\sigma} vs Pr content in SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} in comparison with the data for Y1_{-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} (Ref. [23]).

  the framework of our model, by a gradual increase of the state's localization degree (the decrease of the W_{\alpha}/W_{D} ratio).[24] At the same time, a domorlike character of the Pr^{3+}\rightarrowBa^{2+} substitution results in the essential rise of the S_{300} value with doping level in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system, on whose background the influence of a strong states localization on the S(T) curves shape becomes less pronounced. Taking into account these different reasons for the S(T) transformation in the investigated systems, one can explain the noted above fact that for the samples of the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems with the same S_{300} value T_{c} is higher in the first case. Indeed, it is obvious that the hybridization effect resulting in the strong band broadening should affect the T_{c} value stronger compared to the hole filling effect. On the other hand, the hole filling effect leads to a stronger S_{300} rise. As a result, the same S_{300} value is reached by the Pr\rightarrowBa substitution at a lower Pr content than by the Pr\rightarrowY one (see Fig. 4). It is clear that T_{c} in the first case should be higher in agreement with our experimental results.

Finally, let us discuss the common reason for the superconductivity suppression in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with different deviations from stoichiometry. The data presented in Figs. 2 and 6 show that a stronger band broadening in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system is accompanied by a faster T_{c} drop. We would like to note, that analyzing the band spectrum transformation in the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with increasing oxygen deficit[24] as well as under different nonisovalent substitutions[24, 26] including the codoped system[68] we have concluded that there is the universal correlation between the effective bandwidth and the critical temperature value. The existence of such a correlation can be easily understood qualitatively. It is clear that doping cannot lead (at least in most cases) to an increase of the total number of states in the band. If so, a broadening of the band has to be accompanied by decreasing value of the DOS function at the Fermi level. The latter can be considered as the major reason for the T_{c} decrease. Thus the modification of the band spectrum in the normal state influences the superconducting properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system. For this reason it was interesting to check the presence of the T_{c}(W_{D}) correlation in the case of Pr-doped samples. Results of this checking are shown in Fig. 7 together with the data for other doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems taken from our previous publications. As one can see the T_{c}(W_{D}) dependence for the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} and SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems also follows the universal correlation.[68] Note, that this finding points again to a slighter effect of the hole filling on the superconducting properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system compared to the band broadening. On the other hand, this fact can be considered as an evidence for the conclusion that praseodymium affects the superconducting properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system due to its influence on the band spectrum modification, i.e., like other nonisovalent impurities. A specific role of the Pr impurity manifests itself in the fact that due to an effect of the states hybridization praseodymium affects the structure of the conduction band drastically, inducing the strong band broadening accompanied by the strong states localization. Let us note that in the case of Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} substitution for Ba_{2} by BaSr and heat treating the samples in argon prior to oxygenation was demonstrated to increase the critical Pr content x_{c} to 0.7,[69] which seems to rule out the pair-breaking mechanism as the main course of the T_{c} suppression and to support therefore our point of view, as well as the conclusion drawn in Ref. [22].

## V Conclusions

In summary, the results obtained and the comparative analysis of the band spectrum transformation in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} and Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} systems based on the interpretation of the thermopower data in the framework of the narrow-band model allow us to draw the following conclusions.

(i) The substitution by Pr for the Ba site affects the properties of the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system much stronger compared to the Pr\rightarrowR one resulting in the increasing oxygen content, appearance of an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition, a stronger rise of the thermopower, and a faster T_{c} drop.

(ii) The Pr\rightarrowY substitution affects very slightly the total number of electrons in the conduction band due to the fact that the valence of the Pr ion in the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system is close to 3+. To the contrary, in the SmBa_{2-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{3}O_{y} system the nonisovalent Pr\rightarrowBa substitution results in the hole filling effect, and the Pr ion on the Ba site influences the charge-carrier concentration like other rare-earth impurities placed at the Ba site.

(iii) In both kinds of Pr doping praseodymium has a remarkable effect on the conduction-band transformation inducing the strong band broadening accompanied by the strong states localization. Such an influence can be attributed to the effect of the hybridization between 4f states of Pr ion and the conduction-band states. In the case of the Pr\rightarrowBa substitution a random ordering of the excess oxygen caused by a higher valence of Pr compared to Ba leads to an additional band broadening and localization of the states.

(iv) Despite a different extent of the Pr influence on the band spectrum and the critical temperature in the

Figure 7: Correlation between the critical temperature and the effective bandwidth in the RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{y} system with different doping. Data for the systems without Pr are taken from Refs. [24], [26] and [68].

  Y1-_x_PrxBa2Cu3Oy and SmBa2-_x_PrxCu3Oy systems, the T_{c}(W_{D}) dependence for these systems follows the universal correlation for different substitutions in YBa2Cu3Oy. The main reason for the superconductivity suppression by praseodymium in both systems is the modification of the band spectrum caused by the Pr introducing into the lattice.
