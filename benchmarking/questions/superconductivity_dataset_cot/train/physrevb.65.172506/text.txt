###### Abstract

The crystal structure and magnetism of the layered ruthenocuprate Pb2RuSr2Cu2O8Cl have been studied. A powder neutron diffraction study reveals that the crystal structure is tetragonal (space group \(P\)4/_mmm_, \(a\) = 3.866 81(9) A , \(c\) = 15.3699(8) A at 295 K) with disordered rotations and tilts of the RuO6 octahedra with no structural transitions down to 10 K. A magnetic transition to a canted antiferromagnetic state occurs at \(T_{M}\) = 117 K, and the ordered Ru moment is 1.1(1) \(m_{B}\) , at 10 K from Rietveld analysis of neutron data. A spin-flop or metamagnetic transition is observed above a field of 0.5 T, and the saturated ferromagnetic Ru moment is 0.5_m__B_ - 0.8_m__B_ . The sample is not superconducting.

The coexistence of weak ferromagnetism and superconductivity has recently been observed in the 1212-type layered ruthenocuprate RuSr2GdCu2O8 (Refs. 1-9) and in 1222-type analogs such as RuSr2CeO8Gd1,5Cu2O10,1 Bulk superconductivity originates in the CuO2 planes below \(T_{c}\) < 50 K, and a magnetic transition (\(T_{M}\) = 136 K in RuSr2GdCu2O8) results from the ordering of moments in the RuO2 planes and persists through the onset of superconductivity to the lowest temperature investigated (1.9 K).3\(G\)-type antiferromagnetic order within the RuO2 planes has been observed from neutron scattering experiments6 on RuSr2GdCu2O8 with an ordered moment of 1.18(6)\(m_{B}\) , and an upper limit of 0.1_m__B_ was obtained for the ferromagnetic component. The Ru moments are canted in RuSr2GdCu2O8, yielding a small ferromagnetic moment in zero field, due to a Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction between neighboring Ru moments which is nonzero due to the symmetry-breaking tilts and rotations of the RuO6 octahedra. Upon the application of a magnetic field the Ru spins cant further away from the _G_-type magnetic structure until at 7 T there is no evidence of antiferromagnetic order.

In this paper, results from the ruthenocuprate Pb2RuSr2Cu2O8Cl (Fig. 1) will be discussed. This material has a similar structure to RuSr2GdCu2O8, but diamagnetic Pb2Cl layers replace Gd, making the material an attractive candidate for neutron diffraction and magnetic measurements although it is difficult to prepare as a pure phase. The isosstructural materials Pb2_M_Sr2Cu2O8Cl (_M_ = Nb,Ta,Sb) have previously been reported;10-12 they are insulating (_r_ ~ 106\(\Omega\) cm, at 300 K) and are not ferromagnetic.

Samples were prepared by the solid-state reaction of RuO2, SrCO3, CuO, and PbO and at 550-700 degC. Details of the synthesis will be reported elsewhere. It has proved very difficult to prepare Pb2RuSr2Cu2O8Cl free of other phases. The sample used here contained 73% (by mass) Pb2RuSr2Cu2O8Cl, 19% 'SrRuO3,' and 8% CuO; phase proportions were determined by Rietveld fitting of neutron data. Although this sample contains secondary phases, it has enabled the basic physical properties of the ruthenocuprate Pb2RuSr2Cu2O8Cl to be determined as below.

Neutron powder diffraction data were collected on the General Materials Diffractometer (GEM) at the Rutherford-Appleton laboratory. Neutron diffraction patterns were collected at 295 and 10 K from a 1 g sample in 1 h. The data from the 20, 60, 90, and 169.3deg 2 _th_ detector banks were analyzed simultaneously, giving a \(d\) space range of 0.42-12 A, using the gsas program.13 The neutron diffraction pattern of the Pb2RuSr2Cu2O8Cl sample showed it to contain a 'SrRuO3' perovskite phase and CuO. These secondary phases were included in the refinement and excellent Rietveld fits (\(R_{P}\) = 2.55% and 2.61% at 295 and 10 K, respectively) were obtained (Fig. 2) with a tetragonal \(P\)4/_mmm_ symmetry structural model for Pb2RuSr2Cu2O8Cl [_a_ = 3.866 81(9) A, \(c\) = 15.3688(7) A at 295 K; \(a\) = 3.858 04(8) A, \(c\) = 15.3094(7) A at 10 K]. The atomic

 displacement factors for all sites in the Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl structure were refined, and displacive disorder of the oxygen atoms within the RuO\({}_{2}\) planes and those linking the CuO\({}_{5}\) units and RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra was evidenced by large \(U\) values. This disorder was modeled in the same way as that in the 1212 and 1222-type ruthenocurates.[6] The RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra are rotated by 13.4\({}^{\circ}\) around the \(z\) axis and are tilted away from this axis by 7.1\({}^{\circ}\) at 295 K. These displacements were also observed at 10 K, showing that they are due to static disorder within the average structure rather than phonon motion. The metal and oxygen site occupancies did not yield any significant deviations from complete filling. The apical Cu-O distance [2.243(5) A] is longer than that in RuSrGdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)[2.184(6) A] at room temperature. A bond valence sum calculation shows that the hole transfer to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes is \(\sim\)0.1 less than that in RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\). Doping studies of the latter material have shown that the hole concentration per Cu is 0.08,[14, 15] so we conclude that CuO\({}_{2}\) planes in Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl are essentially undoped.

Antiferromagnetic order was detected in the 10 K diffraction pattern by the observation of the (1/2 1/2 1/2) magnetic diffraction peak which is not observed in the 295 K pattern [Fig. 3(a)]. This was fitted with a \(G\)-type antiferromagnetic model, as was used for RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\),[6] in which the spins are antiparallel to their neighbors in the \(ab\) plane and along \(c\). Assuming the spins lie parallel to the \(c\) axis, this model gives a refined Ru moment of 1.1(1) \(\mu_{B}\) which is within error of the value \(\mu_{\rm Ru}\)= 1.18(6) \(\mu_{B}\) in RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\).[8] There is no increase in the intensity of any of the (0 0 \(l\)) Bragg peaks between 295 and 10 K which would be expected from a ferromagnetic ordering in the \(xy\) plane. The temperature dependence of the (1/2 1/2 1/2) intensity [Fig. 3(b)] shows the magnetic ordering transition in Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl at 117 K.

Variable-field neutron diffraction measurements were recorded up to 3 T at 10 K using an Oxford Instruments 7.5-T cryomagnet. At fields higher than 0.5 T, the intensity of the (1/2 1/2 1/2) magnetic peak decreases while an increase of the (0 0 3) peak intensity is observed corresponding to the induced ferromagnetism in the \(xy\) plane [Fig. 4(a)]. There is no significant (1/2 1/2 1/2) intensity remaining at 1.1 T [Fig. 4(b)]. Returning to zero field, the (1/2 1/2 1/2) peak recovers its original intensity, indicating that the effect of the field is reversible. Evidence of such a spin-flop or metamagnetic transition has been reported in RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) at 0.4 T (Ref. [6]) and RuSr\({}_{2}\)YCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (Ref. [16]). The similarity of the variable-field neutron diffraction data for Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl to those of the 1212 phases suggests that this field-dependent magnetic order is common to the ruthenocurate structures, but more detailed neutron diffraction experiments on a phase pure sample of Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl will be necessary in order to confirm this.

Magnetizations were measured between 10 and 300 K on a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in an applied field of 0.1 T after zero-field and field cooling. A ferromagnetic transition at a Curie temperature of \(T_{M}\)= 117(1) K is evidenced from the rise in magnetism and the divergence of the field-cooled and zero-field-cooled magnetizations (Fig. 5). This coincides with the appearance of the (1/2 1/2 1/2) neutron peak that characterises long-range antiferromagnetic order [Fig. 3(b)], showing that the magnetic order in fields 0 \(\leq\)\(H\)\(<\)0.5 T has a mixed ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic character as expected for a canted antiferromagnet (weak ferromagnet). No sepa

(b) shows the temperature variation of the (1/2 1/2 1/2) peak intensity.

Lower, middle, and upper reflection markers correspond to Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl, SrRuO\({}_{3}\), and CuO, respectively.

  rate ferromagnetic transition is observed for the '\(\cdot\)'SrRuO\({}_{3}\)' 'secondary phase. This suggests that nonstoichiometry or chemical substitutions have either suppressed the ferromagnetism found in pure SrRuO\({}_{3}\) (\(T_{M}\) = 165 K) or reduced the Curie temperature until it is coincident with that of the main Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl phase. The former scenario seems most probable as there is no observable ferromagnetic contribution to the '\(\cdot\)'SrRuO\({}_{3}\)' ' peaks in the 10-K neutron profile. The magnetic properties of SrRuO\({}_{3}\) are known to be sensitive to substitutions at the Sr (Ref. [17]) or Ru sites [e.g., in SrRu\({}_{1-x}\)Pb\({}_{x}\)O\({}_{3}\) (Ref. [18])] and to the synthesis conditions, [19] so the present '\(\cdot\)'SrRuO\({}_{3}\)' ' phase is likely to be a complex (Sr,Pb)(Ru,Pb,Cu)O\({}_{3\pm x}\) composition. This is corroborated by the difference between the lattice parameters of SrRuO\({}_{3}\) (Ref. [20] [\(a\) = 5.5328(1) A, \(b\) = 7.8471(1) A, \(c\) = 5.5693(1) A] and those of the '\(\cdot\)'SrRuO\({}_{3}\)' ' phase derived from our Rietveld refinement [\(a\) = 5.5589(1) A, \(b\) = 7.8250(1) A, \(c\) = 5.5646(1) A].

Magnetic hysteresis loops recorded at 10 K with the field swept between \(\pm\)5 T confirm the ferromagnetic order and yield a moment of 0.8(1) \(\mu_{B}\) per Ru atom in the sample; a typical loop is displayed in the inset of Fig. 5. The maximum possible contribution of the 19% '\(\cdot\)'SrRuO\({}_{3}\)' ' secondary phase is \(\sim\)0.3 \(\mu_{B}\) per Ru [if it were stoichiometric SrRuO\({}_{3}\) which has \(\mu_{\rm Ru}\)= 1.4 \(\mu_{B}\) at 5 T (Ref. [18])]. Hence we conclude that the principal ferromagnetic phase at high fields is Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl for which the saturated Ru moment of 0.5\(\mu_{B}\)\(-\)0.8\(\mu_{B}\) is comparable to the value of 1.09\(\mu_{B}\) for RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\). [14, 15] The narrowing of the hysteresis loop for Pb\({}_{2}\)SrRuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl at low fields is consistent with the transition from weak ferromagnetism to full ferromagnetism above 0.5 T. The Ru magnetism in Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl is thus similar to that of the ruthenocuprates RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (Ref. [6]) and RuSr\({}_{2}\)Ce\({}_{0.5}\)Gd\({}_{1.5}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10}\) (Ref. [1]).

The resistivity of a sintered polycrystalline bar was measured between 10 and 300 K using the standard four-probe ac technique. Resistivity measurements show that the sample is semiconducting with a room-temperature resistivity of 160 G cm. There is no evidence for a superconducting transition at low temperatures. This is consistent with the copper oxide planes being too underdoped to superconduct as the apical Cu-O bond length is longer for Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl than that in RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) .

In conclusion, the ruthenocuprate Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl has a crystal structure (including rotations and tilts of the RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra) and magnetic properties that are very similar to the previously reported Ru-1212 and -1222 phases, although the sample is not superconducting. Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl is a canted antiferromagnet in zero field with a Curie temperature of \(T_{M}\) = 117 K and an ordered moment of 1.1\(\mu_{B}\) per Ru. The Ru spins undergo a spin-flop or metamagnetic transition above \(H\) = 0.5 T, giving a saturated Ru moment of 0.5\(\mu_{B}\)\(-\)0.8\(\mu_{B}\) . Despite the similarity to the Ru-1212 and -1222 phases, the carrier distribution in Pb\({}_{2}\)RuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\)Cl appears to be different, as the lack of superconductivity and the longer apical Cu-O distance suggest that the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes are essentially undoped. The RuO\({}_{2}\) planes thus contain Ru\({}^{5+}\) with little or no electron doping to the Ru\({}^{4+}\) state. This confirms that the weak ferromagnetism in the layered ruthenocuprates arises from the local symmetry-breaking structural distortions rather than a mixed Ru\({}^{4+}\)/Ru\({}^{5+}\) electronic state.
