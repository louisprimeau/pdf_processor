###### Abstract

We present a study concerning the partial substitution of yttrium at the lanthanum site of the undoped LaFeAsO and superconducting LaFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} compounds. We prepared samples with a nominal yttrium content up to 70% producing simultaneous shrinkage of both the a- and c-lattice parameters by 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. The chemical pressure provided by the partial substitution with this smaller ion size causes a lowering of the spin density wave temperature in the undoped compounds, as well as an increase in the superconducting transition temperatures in the doped ones. The 15% fluorine-doped samples reach a maximum critical temperature of 40.2 K for the 50% yttrium substitution. Comparison with literature data indicates that chemical pressure cannot be the only mechanism which tunes drastically both T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} in 1111 compounds. Our data suggest that the structural disorder induced by the partial substitution in the La site or by doping could play an important role as well.

## I Introduction

Iron-arsenide-based compounds (pnictides) have shown superconductivity (SC) with surprisingly high T_{c}. The first discovered superconductor has been LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} with T_{c} as high as 26 K.[1] This compound of chemical formula REFeAsO_{x}F_{1-x} (RE being a rare earth) belongs to the so-called "1111" family. After only one month, T_{c} has doubled thanks to a substitution of the La by different RE elements (Sm, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Gd) yielding an increase up to 52 K with Pr (Ref. [2]) and 55 K with Sm.[3] Almost the same high critical temperature has been reported in hole-doped oxygen deficient REFeAsO_{1-\delta} compounds with a maximum critical temperature of 51, 54, and 55 K in Pr, Nd, and Sm systems, respectively.[4, 5] Nowadays, T_{c} seems to have reached its maximum value, (56 K) in the electron-doped Gd_{1-x}Th_{x}FeAsO.[6]

The La system presents the lowest T_{c} within the 1111 family, nearly one half of the maximum value, likely due to the large ionic radius of La. This aspect makes La-1111 one of the best systems to investigate the effects of the external and chemical pressure on T_{c}. By applying an external pressure of 4 GPa to optimally doped LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}, T_{c} has been raised up to 43 K then slowly dropped off to 9 K for larger pressures.[7] F-doped and O-deficient La1111 under external pressure has shown how the increase in T_{c} is related to doping. LaFeAsO_{1-\delta} under 1.5 GPa (Ref. [8]) has shown a superconducting T_{c} onset of about 50 K, which is the highest record in La-based system.

Also, the role of chemical pressure has been explored by the partial substitution of the RE element in the La_{1-y},RE_{y}FeAsO_{1-\delta} compound. T_{c} up to 43 K has been obtained in the 40% yttrium-substituted compound.[9] In the case of RE=Sm, a monotonic rise of T_{c} from 30 K (y=0) to (y=1) 55 K (Ref. [10]) has been reported.

All these experimental results clearly evidence that both the substitution with smaller ions and the application of an external pressure cause lattice shrinkage, even if the mechanisms involved are different. The chemical pressure is isotopic, whereas the external pressure may induce an anisotropic shrinkage because of the pnictide-layered structure. In both cases, a strong correlation between lattice shrinkage and T_{c} can be established.

The external pressure produces significant effects also on the structural transition and/or spin density wave (SDW) ordering-related temperatures of the parent compound. In a weakly F-doped SmFeAsO sample, a reduction in T_{\rm SDW} with pressure has been observed.[11] A suppression of the SDW with pressure has been put in evidence also in CaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [12]) and in K_{x}Sr_{1-x}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [13]) (122 family). In Ref. [12], it has been argued that the simultaneous increase in T_{c} and decrease in T_{\rm SDW} with pressure are evidences that pressure induces doping through charge transfer from the charge reservoir block. These aspects have never been considered in systems where the chemical pressure is varied.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of chemical pressure on T_{c} and T_{\rm SDW} through the partial substitution of the La ions by Y in the pure and 15% F-doped LaFeAsO compounds. Increasing the Y content, the cell parameters reduce monotonically. In the undoped compounds, this shrinking results in a monotone decrease in T_{\rm SDW} down to 120 K, while in the 15% F-doped system the critical temperature increases reaching a maximum of about 40 K for 50% yttrium substitution and then decreases with further increasing yttrium content.

  

## II Experimental

### Synthesis

The samples of the series La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (y=0, 0.30, 0.50, and 0.70 and x=0 and 0.15) were synthesized at _ambient pressure_ by a solid-state reaction method using high-purity (La, Y)As, Fe_{2}O_{3}, Fe, and FeF_{2} with a two-step reaction procedure.[14, 15] A stoichiometric pellet was pressed and reacted in a welded tantalum crucible closed in quartz ampouleus at 1000 ^{\circ}C for 70 h. The pellet was subsequently grinded, mixed, pressed in a new pellet, and annealed with the same procedure at 1250 ^{\circ}C for 25 h. All the handling and manipulation of the samples was carried out in a glovebox, where the working atmosphere was continuously purified to less than 1 ppm H_{2}O/O_{2}. The use of tantalum crucibles prevented losses of fluorine, the dopant responsible for the superconductivity, even if some consumption of arsenic by tantalum was observed. The final product was a black and hard cylinder, with a density of about 80% of the theoretical value, which has been cut for measurements. The same procedure was also used without success to synthesize the compounds with y=1, YFeAsO, and YFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15}: only a mixture constituted by Y_{2}O_{3}, YAs, FeAs, and Fe_{2}As (and YOF in the F-doped sample) was obtained. Probably, in this case, a high-pressure synthesizing method followed by a special rapid quench process would be necessary, as reported by Yang _et al.[16]_

### Sample characterization: Structural analysis

Phase identification was performed by the x-ray powder diffraction [(XPRD) phillips PW3020; Bragg-Brentano geometry; Cu K_{a}; range 15-120^{\circ}2\theta; step 0.020^{\circ}; and sampling time of 10 s]; the crystal structures of the samples were refined in the space group P4/mmm-129 (origin choice 2) according to the Rietveld method using the fullprof software. By means of a LaB_{6} standard, an instrumental resolution file was obtained and applied during refinements in order to detect possible microstructural contribution to XRPD peak shape.

Figure 1 shows the Rietveld refinement plot obtained for the sample with nominal composition (La_{0.70}Y_{0.30})FeAs(O_{0.85}F_{0.15}), containing (La,Y)As and (La,Y)OF as secondary phases, whose amounts result 6.4% and 8%, respectively.

The effectiveness of the substitution is proved by the monotonic decrease in the a- and c-lattice parameters obtained from the Rietveld refinement with Y content as shown in Fig. 2. Information on the chemical homogeneity of the samples was obtained analyzing the broadening XRPD lines by means of the Williamson-Hall plot method.[17] Generally, in case size effects are negligible, a straight line passing through the origin have to be observed, whereas the slope provides the lattice strain. When broadening is not isotropic, size and strain effects along some crystallographic directions can be obtained by considering different orders of the same reflection. For solid solutions, the \Delta d/d (d: interplanar spacing) term can also have a contribution from chemical fluctuations and inhomogeneities inside the sample because the larger the distribution of lattice parameters the broader the peaks. Broadening related to chemical inhomogeneity is generally anisotropic, depending on the symmetry of the crystal system.[18] Williamson-Hall plots for all the F-doped samples (not showed) evidence two main features: (1) size contribution is negligible since a straight line passing through the origin can be traced and (2) broadening related to microstrain and/or chemical fluctuations is isotropic, indicating a good chemical homogeneities of our samples since they crystallize in the tetragonal system.

Figure 2 shows the cell parameters of La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO and La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} (square symbol) as a function of yttrium nominal content. As expected, in the undoped compounds, starting from the y=0 sample (a=4.033 A, c=8.744 A) the effect of the substitution results in a monotonic decrease by 1.8% and 1.7% of a- and c-lattice parameters, respectively, for the highest yttrium content (a=3.962 A, c=8.597 A). The 15% fluorine doping shows a further shrinkage of about 0.3% of these cell parameters, indicating the covalent character of the intralayer chemical bonding due to the smaller radius of fluorine as compared to the oxygen one.[3]

Substitution at the La site has been earlier reported in oxygen deficient La_{1-x}Y_{y}FeAsO_{1-\delta} compounds produced by the high-pressure synthesis process:[9] the a- and c-lattice parameters exhibit a weak decrease, 0.92% and 0.88%, respec

  the resistivity but present the same behavior as a function of y.

## III III. Discussion

We have shown that both T_{c} in La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} samples and T_{\rm SDW} in the parent La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO samples present a clear dependence on the Y content. Since the lattice parameters monotonically shrink with increasing Y content, the evolution of T_{c} and T_{\rm SDW} can be discussed as a function of chemical pressure.

Figure 7(a) shows the critical temperatures of the La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} series as a function of a axis with data collected from literature. As it was previously noted for oxygen deficient compounds,[9] the literature data of the 1111 family seem to stay into a common line which describes the increase in T_{c} with the decrease in the lattice parameters, showing a clear indication in favor of the role played by the chemical pressure in increasing T_{c}.

Our 15% F-doped La-Y series, instead--by increasing the chemical pressure--show a peculiar domelike behavior, compressed and shifted in the right-bottom side of the graph in respect to that of the 1111 family with high-T_{c} rare earth. With decreasing the a axis, T_{c} increases showing a maximum which is about 40 K for a = 3.975 nm and then decreases for smaller a axis.

In Fig. 7(b) we plot T_{\rm SDW} of the La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO series as a function of a-lattice parameter with data collected from literature on the 1111 family, with RE=Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, and Tb. In all these data, T_{\rm SDW} was estimated by the maximum of d\rho/dT. The graph shows two distinct curves which monotonically rise with increasing the a axis. The upper line contains all the high-T_{c} rare earths. The lower line contains the La-Y series. This behavior resembles the one reported for T_{\rm SDW} versus external pressure in the 1111 (Ref. 11) and 122 (Refs. 12 and 13) families, confirming the effectiveness of the Y substitution in La site in producing chemical pressure.

The twofold effects of increasing T_{c} and decreasing T_{\rm SDW} were considered as evidence of doping induced by pressure.[13] Our data cannot exclude that chemical pressure can contribute to doping, but the indication we can draw is that this is a small effect. In fact, in the undoped compound, starting from y = 0, the a axis is shrunk by 1.8% without observing the occurrence of superconductivity, while the superconductivity occurs after F substitution, which causes a much lower further shrinkage (about 0.3%). Therefore, we

The black arrows indicate the critical temperatures T_{c} evaluated in the same way as the resistivity ones, that is, through the intersection of the lines corresponding to the normal state above T_{c} and the steepest part of the magnetization in the superconducting one.

(c) T_{c} versus T_{\rm SDW} for La-Y series and other rare earths. The SC samples used for comparison are LaFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.1-\delta} (Ref. 24), CeFeAsO_{0.84}F_{0.16} (Ref. 25), PrFeAsO_{0.84}F_{0.16} (Ref. 2), NdFeAsO_{1-\delta} (Ref. 5), SmFeAsO_{0.5}F_{0.1} (Ref. 3), Gd_{0.85}Th_{0.2}FeAsO (Ref. 6), TbFeAsO_{1-\delta} (Ref. 26), and DyFeAsO_{1-\delta} (Ref. 26). T_{\rm SDW} data for undoped REFeAsO are, when different data are present for the same compound, the average between the maximum and minimum values reported: La [T_{\rm SDW}=138 K (Ref. 19) and T_{\rm SDW}=143 K (Ref. 27)]; Ce [T_{\rm SDW}=136 K (Ref. 27) and T_{\rm SDW}=140 K (Ref. 28)]; Pr [T_{\rm SDW}=127 K (Ref. 21) and T_{\rm SDW}=139 K (Ref. 27)]; Nd [T_{\rm SDW}=137 K (Ref. 29) and T_{\rm SDW}=141 K (Ref. 27)]; Sm [T_{\rm SDW}=131 K (Ref. 26)]; Gd [T_{\rm SDW}=125 K (Ref. 6)]; and Tb [T_{\rm SDW}=124 K (Ref. 26)].

  conclude that in the 1111 family, doping with F, as well as the O vacancies, is able to suppress the SDW and favor superconductivity much more effectively than chemical pressure does.

Finally, Fig. 7(c) shows T_{c} as a function of T_{\rm SDW}. Also in this case, a correlation can be found provided that we consider separately the La-Y series and the high-T_{c} rare-earth series. The graph suggests that smaller T_{\rm SDW} favors higher T_{c}, even with a saturation around 55 and 40 K, in the high-T_{c} rare earth and in La-Y series, respectively, occurs. This point needs more investigation.

It is interesting to discuss the differences between La and other rare-earths 1111 compounds that emerge from the discussion above. It is evident that the larger ionic radius of La cannot explain these differences because by substituting a certain amount of Y, we can obtain a cell volume smaller than in the case of Ce and Pr and comparable with that of Nd, but T_{c} values remain smaller.

We should point out that the substitution of La with Y decreases the average lattice parameters, but--locally--this could not be equivalent to the effect exerted by ions with smaller radius. Structural disorder induced by substitution could also be detrimental to superconductivity. Moreover, an important role can also be played by a different kind of doping. By substituting up to 50% of F, T_{c} does not reach 40 K, while reducing O, T_{c} over 40 K can be obtained.[8] To better clarify the different effects of doping and chemical pressure, further studies on La-Y series with a different type of doping can be useful.

## IV Conclusions

In order to investigate the effect of chemical pressure on normal and superconducting properties of the 1111 compounds, we have synthesized La_{1-x}Y_{x}FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} compound as a function of yttrium content and x=0 and 0.15 at ambient pressure. The progressive inclusion of Y is proved by the monotonic decreasing in the lattice parameters as a function of y content. In the undoped compounds, the SDW ordering progressively shifts to lower temperature and superconductivity does not occur. In the 15%-doped samples, T_{c} progressively grows from 24 to 40 K with increasing y from 0 to 0.5 and then decreases. Similar evolution of T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} has been observed as a function of external pressure, indicating that chemical and external pressures play a very similar role.

To emphasize the role of chemical pressure, we have plotted T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} as a function of a axis of La-Y series, in comparison with other rare earths. Both T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} of La-Y system evolve in similar but distinct way with respect to other high-T_{c} rare-earths-1111 compounds.

Lattices parameters have been widely varied in the La-Y series obtaining a-axis values in between those of Nd and Sm. This indicates that chemical pressure cannot be the only mechanism which tune drastically both T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} in 1111 compounds. Our data suggest that the structural disorder induced by the partial substitution in the La site or by doping could play an important role as well.

###### Abstract

We present a study concerning the partial substitution of yttrium at the lanthanum site of the undoped LaFeAsO and superconducting LaFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} compounds. We prepared samples with a nominal yttrium content up to 70% producing simultaneous shrinkage of both the a- and c-lattice parameters by 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. The chemical pressure provided by the partial substitution with this smaller ion size causes a lowering of the spin density wave temperature in the undoped compounds, as well as an increase in the superconducting transition temperatures in the doped ones. The 15% fluorine-doped samples reach a maximum critical temperature of 40.2 K for the 50% yttrium substitution. Comparison with literature data indicates that chemical pressure cannot be the only mechanism which tunes drastically both T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} in 1111 compounds. Our data suggest that the structural disorder induced by the partial substitution in the La site or by doping could play an important role as well.

## I Introduction

Iron-arsenide-based compounds (pnictides) have shown superconductivity (SC) with surprisingly high T_{c}. The first discovered superconductor has been LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} with T_{c} as high as 26 K.[1] This compound of chemical formula REFeAsO_{x}F_{1-x} (RE being a rare earth) belongs to the so-called "1111" family. After only one month, T_{c} has doubled thanks to a substitution of the La by different RE elements (Sm, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Gd) yielding an increase up to 52 K with Pr (Ref. [2]) and 55 K with Sm.[3] Almost the same high critical temperature has been reported in hole-doped oxygen deficient REFeAsO_{1-\delta} compounds with a maximum critical temperature of 51, 54, and 55 K in Pr, Nd, and Sm systems, respectively.[4, 5] Nowadays, T_{c} seems to have reached its maximum value, (56 K) in the electron-doped Gd_{1-x}Th_{x}FeAsO.[6]

The La system presents the lowest T_{c} within the 1111 family, nearly one half of the maximum value, likely due to the large ionic radius of La. This aspect makes La-1111 one of the best systems to investigate the effects of the external and chemical pressure on T_{c}. By applying an external pressure of 4 GPa to optimally doped LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}, T_{c} has been raised up to 43 K then slowly dropped off to 9 K for larger pressures.[7] F-doped and O-deficient La1111 under external pressure has shown how the increase in T_{c} is related to doping. LaFeAsO_{1-\delta} under 1.5 GPa (Ref. [8]) has shown a superconducting T_{c} onset of about 50 K, which is the highest record in La-based system.

Also, the role of chemical pressure has been explored by the partial substitution of the RE element in the La_{1-y},RE_{y}FeAsO_{1-\delta} compound. T_{c} up to 43 K has been obtained in the 40% yttrium-substituted compound.[9] In the case of RE=Sm, a monotonic rise of T_{c} from 30 K (y=0) to (y=1) 55 K (Ref. [10]) has been reported.

All these experimental results clearly evidence that both the substitution with smaller ions and the application of an external pressure cause lattice shrinkage, even if the mechanisms involved are different. The chemical pressure is isotopic, whereas the external pressure may induce an anisotropic shrinkage because of the pnictide-layered structure. In both cases, a strong correlation between lattice shrinkage and T_{c} can be established.

The external pressure produces significant effects also on the structural transition and/or spin density wave (SDW) ordering-related temperatures of the parent compound. In a weakly F-doped SmFeAsO sample, a reduction in T_{\rm SDW} with pressure has been observed.[11] A suppression of the SDW with pressure has been put in evidence also in CaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [12]) and in K_{x}Sr_{1-x}Fe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [13]) (122 family). In Ref. [12], it has been argued that the simultaneous increase in T_{c} and decrease in T_{\rm SDW} with pressure are evidences that pressure induces doping through charge transfer from the charge reservoir block. These aspects have never been considered in systems where the chemical pressure is varied.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of chemical pressure on T_{c} and T_{\rm SDW} through the partial substitution of the La ions by Y in the pure and 15% F-doped LaFeAsO compounds. Increasing the Y content, the cell parameters reduce monotonically. In the undoped compounds, this shrinking results in a monotone decrease in T_{\rm SDW} down to 120 K, while in the 15% F-doped system the critical temperature increases reaching a maximum of about 40 K for 50% yttrium substitution and then decreases with further increasing yttrium content.

  

## II Experimental

### Synthesis

The samples of the series La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (y=0, 0.30, 0.50, and 0.70 and x=0 and 0.15) were synthesized at _ambient pressure_ by a solid-state reaction method using high-purity (La, Y)As, Fe_{2}O_{3}, Fe, and FeF_{2} with a two-step reaction procedure.[14, 15] A stoichiometric pellet was pressed and reacted in a welded tantalum crucible closed in quartz ampouleus at 1000 ^{\circ}C for 70 h. The pellet was subsequently grinded, mixed, pressed in a new pellet, and annealed with the same procedure at 1250 ^{\circ}C for 25 h. All the handling and manipulation of the samples was carried out in a glovebox, where the working atmosphere was continuously purified to less than 1 ppm H_{2}O/O_{2}. The use of tantalum crucibles prevented losses of fluorine, the dopant responsible for the superconductivity, even if some consumption of arsenic by tantalum was observed. The final product was a black and hard cylinder, with a density of about 80% of the theoretical value, which has been cut for measurements. The same procedure was also used without success to synthesize the compounds with y=1, YFeAsO, and YFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15}: only a mixture constituted by Y_{2}O_{3}, YAs, FeAs, and Fe_{2}As (and YOF in the F-doped sample) was obtained. Probably, in this case, a high-pressure synthesizing method followed by a special rapid quench process would be necessary, as reported by Yang _et al.[16]_

### Sample characterization: Structural analysis

Phase identification was performed by the x-ray powder diffraction [(XPRD) phillips PW3020; Bragg-Brentano geometry; Cu K_{a}; range 15-120^{\circ}2\theta; step 0.020^{\circ}; and sampling time of 10 s]; the crystal structures of the samples were refined in the space group P4/mmm-129 (origin choice 2) according to the Rietveld method using the fullprof software. By means of a LaB_{6} standard, an instrumental resolution file was obtained and applied during refinements in order to detect possible microstructural contribution to XRPD peak shape.

Figure 1 shows the Rietveld refinement plot obtained for the sample with nominal composition (La_{0.70}Y_{0.30})FeAs(O_{0.85}F_{0.15}), containing (La,Y)As and (La,Y)OF as secondary phases, whose amounts result 6.4% and 8%, respectively.

The effectiveness of the substitution is proved by the monotonic decrease in the a- and c-lattice parameters obtained from the Rietveld refinement with Y content as shown in Fig. 2. Information on the chemical homogeneity of the samples was obtained analyzing the broadening XRPD lines by means of the Williamson-Hall plot method.[17] Generally, in case size effects are negligible, a straight line passing through the origin have to be observed, whereas the slope provides the lattice strain. When broadening is not isotropic, size and strain effects along some crystallographic directions can be obtained by considering different orders of the same reflection. For solid solutions, the \Delta d/d (d: interplanar spacing) term can also have a contribution from chemical fluctuations and inhomogeneities inside the sample because the larger the distribution of lattice parameters the broader the peaks. Broadening related to chemical inhomogeneity is generally anisotropic, depending on the symmetry of the crystal system.[18] Williamson-Hall plots for all the F-doped samples (not showed) evidence two main features: (1) size contribution is negligible since a straight line passing through the origin can be traced and (2) broadening related to microstrain and/or chemical fluctuations is isotropic, indicating a good chemical homogeneities of our samples since they crystallize in the tetragonal system.

Figure 2 shows the cell parameters of La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO and La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} (square symbol) as a function of yttrium nominal content. As expected, in the undoped compounds, starting from the y=0 sample (a=4.033 A, c=8.744 A) the effect of the substitution results in a monotonic decrease by 1.8% and 1.7% of a- and c-lattice parameters, respectively, for the highest yttrium content (a=3.962 A, c=8.597 A). The 15% fluorine doping shows a further shrinkage of about 0.3% of these cell parameters, indicating the covalent character of the intralayer chemical bonding due to the smaller radius of fluorine as compared to the oxygen one.[3]

Substitution at the La site has been earlier reported in oxygen deficient La_{1-x}Y_{y}FeAsO_{1-\delta} compounds produced by the high-pressure synthesis process:[9] the a- and c-lattice parameters exhibit a weak decrease, 0.92% and 0.88%, respec

  the resistivity but present the same behavior as a function of y.

## III III. Discussion

We have shown that both T_{c} in La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} samples and T_{\rm SDW} in the parent La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO samples present a clear dependence on the Y content. Since the lattice parameters monotonically shrink with increasing Y content, the evolution of T_{c} and T_{\rm SDW} can be discussed as a function of chemical pressure.

Figure 7(a) shows the critical temperatures of the La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.15} series as a function of a axis with data collected from literature. As it was previously noted for oxygen deficient compounds,[9] the literature data of the 1111 family seem to stay into a common line which describes the increase in T_{c} with the decrease in the lattice parameters, showing a clear indication in favor of the role played by the chemical pressure in increasing T_{c}.

Our 15% F-doped La-Y series, instead--by increasing the chemical pressure--show a peculiar domelike behavior, compressed and shifted in the right-bottom side of the graph in respect to that of the 1111 family with high-T_{c} rare earth. With decreasing the a axis, T_{c} increases showing a maximum which is about 40 K for a = 3.975 nm and then decreases for smaller a axis.

In Fig. 7(b) we plot T_{\rm SDW} of the La_{1-y}Y_{y}FeAsO series as a function of a-lattice parameter with data collected from literature on the 1111 family, with RE=Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, and Tb. In all these data, T_{\rm SDW} was estimated by the maximum of d\rho/dT. The graph shows two distinct curves which monotonically rise with increasing the a axis. The upper line contains all the high-T_{c} rare earths. The lower line contains the La-Y series. This behavior resembles the one reported for T_{\rm SDW} versus external pressure in the 1111 (Ref. 11) and 122 (Refs. 12 and 13) families, confirming the effectiveness of the Y substitution in La site in producing chemical pressure.

The twofold effects of increasing T_{c} and decreasing T_{\rm SDW} were considered as evidence of doping induced by pressure.[13] Our data cannot exclude that chemical pressure can contribute to doping, but the indication we can draw is that this is a small effect. In fact, in the undoped compound, starting from y = 0, the a axis is shrunk by 1.8% without observing the occurrence of superconductivity, while the superconductivity occurs after F substitution, which causes a much lower further shrinkage (about 0.3%). Therefore, we

The black arrows indicate the critical temperatures T_{c} evaluated in the same way as the resistivity ones, that is, through the intersection of the lines corresponding to the normal state above T_{c} and the steepest part of the magnetization in the superconducting one.

(c) T_{c} versus T_{\rm SDW} for La-Y series and other rare earths. The SC samples used for comparison are LaFeAsO_{0.85}F_{0.1-\delta} (Ref. 24), CeFeAsO_{0.84}F_{0.16} (Ref. 25), PrFeAsO_{0.84}F_{0.16} (Ref. 2), NdFeAsO_{1-\delta} (Ref. 5), SmFeAsO_{0.5}F_{0.1} (Ref. 3), Gd_{0.85}Th_{0.2}FeAsO (Ref. 6), TbFeAsO_{1-\delta} (Ref. 26), and DyFeAsO_{1-\delta} (Ref. 26). T_{\rm SDW} data for undoped REFeAsO are, when different data are present for the same compound, the average between the maximum and minimum values reported: La [T_{\rm SDW}=138 K (Ref. 19) and T_{\rm SDW}=143 K (Ref. 27)]; Ce [T_{\rm SDW}=136 K (Ref. 27) and T_{\rm SDW}=140 K (Ref. 28)]; Pr [T_{\rm SDW}=127 K (Ref. 21) and T_{\rm SDW}=139 K (Ref. 27)]; Nd [T_{\rm SDW}=137 K (Ref. 29) and T_{\rm SDW}=141 K (Ref. 27)]; Sm [T_{\rm SDW}=131 K (Ref. 26)]; Gd [T_{\rm SDW}=125 K (Ref. 6)]; and Tb [T_{\rm SDW}=124 K (Ref. 26)].

  conclude that in the 1111 family, doping with F, as well as the O vacancies, is able to suppress the SDW and favor superconductivity much more effectively than chemical pressure does.

Finally, Fig. 7(c) shows T_{c} as a function of T_{\rm SDW}. Also in this case, a correlation can be found provided that we consider separately the La-Y series and the high-T_{c} rare-earth series. The graph suggests that smaller T_{\rm SDW} favors higher T_{c}, even with a saturation around 55 and 40 K, in the high-T_{c} rare earth and in La-Y series, respectively, occurs. This point needs more investigation.

It is interesting to discuss the differences between La and other rare-earths 1111 compounds that emerge from the discussion above. It is evident that the larger ionic radius of La cannot explain these differences because by substituting a certain amount of Y, we can obtain a cell volume smaller than in the case of Ce and Pr and comparable with that of Nd, but T_{c} values remain smaller.

We should point out that the substitution of La with Y decreases the average lattice parameters, but--locally--this could not be equivalent to the effect exerted by ions with smaller radius. Structural disorder induced by substitution could also be detrimental to superconductivity. Moreover, an important role can also be played by a different kind of doping. By substituting up to 50% of F, T_{c} does not reach 40 K, while reducing O, T_{c} over 40 K can be obtained.[8] To better clarify the different effects of doping and chemical pressure, further studies on La-Y series with a different type of doping can be useful.

## IV Conclusions

In order to investigate the effect of chemical pressure on normal and superconducting properties of the 1111 compounds, we have synthesized La_{1-x}Y_{x}FeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} compound as a function of yttrium content and x=0 and 0.15 at ambient pressure. The progressive inclusion of Y is proved by the monotonic decreasing in the lattice parameters as a function of y content. In the undoped compounds, the SDW ordering progressively shifts to lower temperature and superconductivity does not occur. In the 15%-doped samples, T_{c} progressively grows from 24 to 40 K with increasing y from 0 to 0.5 and then decreases. Similar evolution of T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} has been observed as a function of external pressure, indicating that chemical and external pressures play a very similar role.

To emphasize the role of chemical pressure, we have plotted T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} as a function of a axis of La-Y series, in comparison with other rare earths. Both T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} of La-Y system evolve in similar but distinct way with respect to other high-T_{c} rare-earths-1111 compounds.

Lattices parameters have been widely varied in the La-Y series obtaining a-axis values in between those of Nd and Sm. This indicates that chemical pressure cannot be the only mechanism which tune drastically both T_{\rm SDW} and T_{c} in 1111 compounds. Our data suggest that the structural disorder induced by the partial substitution in the La site or by doping could play an important role as well.
