###### Abstract

The influence of hydrostatic pressure on the electrical resistivity \rho and ferromagnetic transition temperature T_{c} of La1-_x_CaMnO3 is presented for x = 0.21, 0.33, and 0.40. Pressure strongly decreases \rho and drives T_{c} up at rates as large as +37 K/GPa for the x = 0.21 specimen; this is significantly larger than dT_{c}/dP values observed in conventional ferromagnets and about eight times larger than dT_{N}/dP observed in Ca1-_x_SrMnO3 antiferromagnets. The transport mechanism in these oxides is influenced in a qualitatively similar way by both pressure and magnetic field. The results are interpreted in the framework of the double-exchange interaction involving conduction via magnetic polarons.

The physical properties of the perovskite-based La1-_x_(Ca, Sr, or Ba)MnO3 compounds have fascinated scientists for over 40 years. Early work by Jonker and van Santen [1] revealed ferromagnetism over an appreciable concentration range. At the time, it was thought to be the first observation of positive indirect magnetic exchange (i.e., positive superexchange interaction). The exchange was believed to originate within the Mn3+-O-Mn4+ complex. Electrical resistance measurements [2] showed activated behavior above the ferromagnetic transition T_{c} followed by the onset of a transition to metallic behavior at T_{c}. These observations led Zener to postulate the double-exchange (DE) model, which differs from superexchange or direct exchange, and describes the influence of magnetism on the electrical resistivity. [3] In this model, the conduction electrons mediate the positive magnetic exchange between the next-nearest neighbor manganese ions. The structure of the La1-_x_CaMnO3 magnetic lattice was investigated by neutron diffraction and numerous antiferromagnetic lattices in the ranges 0 <= x < 0.22 and 0.45 < x < 1, and ferromagnetism in the range 0.2 < x < 0.45 (Ref. [4]) were reported. These observations inspired de Gennes [5] to extend the DE model to describe the magnetic lattices.

  For all specimens the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at zero pressure was reproduced after releasing pressure.

In Fig. 1 the electrical resistivity \rho versus temperature is plotted at three pressures for a specimen of La_{0.79}Ca_{0.21}MnO_{3}. At zero pressure, the peak in \rho corresponds to the ferromagnetic transition temperature and occurs at T_{c} = 203.3 K; the onset of ferromagnetic order induces a strong drop in \rho. Above T_{c} , \rho is activated [plots of ln(\rho) vs 1/T and the formula \rho - \exp\{E_{g}/kT\}] were used to determine the activation energy E_{g} ] with an activation energy for charge-carrier hopping of E_{g} = 108.9 meV. Pressure strongly reduces \rho near room temperature at a rate of \sim - 45%/GPa (- 80.4 m\Omega cm/GPa) (Ref. [16]) and moves T_{c} to higher temperatures. The inset of Fig. 1 shows T_{c} (left abscissa) and E_{g} (right abscissa) versus pressure P. E_{g} is observed to be weakly dependent on P; an initial slope of dE_{g}/dP = - 5.3 meV/GPa (or - 4.9%/GPa) was observed. On the other hand, T_{c} is observed to be strongly pressure dependent with a slope near P = 0 of dT_{c}/dP = + 36.7 K/GPa.[16]

In Fig. 2 the electrical resistivity at a number of pressures is displayed for the La_{0.67}Ca_{0.33}MnO_{3} specimen. Increasing pressure decreases the electrical resistivity near room temperature at a rate of - 49%/GPa (- 16.5 m\Omega cm/GPa) (Ref. [16]) and moves T_{c} to higher temperatures. In an early stage of our investigations, some as-deposited thin-film specimens[12] exhibited a lack of correlation between T_{c} measured by magnetic susceptibility and that inferred from the peak in electrical resistivity. As a means of probing this correlation, or lack thereof, we studied the dependence of T_{c} on pressure for T_{c} obtained from ac magnetic susceptibility measurements X_{\rm ac}_and_ electrical resistivity for the x = 0.33 specimen. In the inset of Fig. 2T_{c} versus P is plotted, the open symbols are for T_{c} determined from \chi_{\rm ac} while the closed symbols are for T_{c} determined from \rho(T). Excellent agreement is observed between these two data sets illustrating that the sharp drop in electrical resistivity coincides with the magnetic transition in the entire pressure range. The slope dT_{c}/dP near P = 0 is + 15.7 K/GPa.[16]

Figure 3(a) displays \rho(T) at a number of pressures for a specimen of La_{0.60}Ca_{0.40}MnO_{3}. Pressure drives T_{c} to higher temperatures at a rate P = 0 of dT_{c}/dP = + 16.0 K/GPa.[16] The T_{c} versus P data for La_{0.60}Ca_{0.40}MnO_{3} are shown in Fig. 3(b); T_{c} nearly saturates at P \approx 1.7 GPa. The electrical resistivity near room temperature is reduced with P at a rate of - 55%/GPa (- 16.5 m\Omega cm/GPa);[16] the increase of \rho near T_{c} at P = 1.73 GPa is probably due to specimen cracking since after releasing pressure the temperature dependence of the P = 0 curve was reproduced, but \rho was larger than the initial value. The electrical resistivity behaves differently for this concentration at temperatures below 200 K. Namely, the \rho(T) curve develops a bump near 120 K

  which is strongly enhanced by pressure. This feature may indicate a magnetic transition from the ferromagnetic state to a canted ferromagnetic state which would decrease electrical conduction within the DE description. Such behavior might arise in the x\!=\!0.40 specimen, and not in the x\!=\!0.21 and 0.33 specimens, since it is close to the boundary of the antiferromagnetic state which occurs at x\!=\!0.49 (Ref. [17]) and pressure appears to have a similar effect on \rho and T_{c} as increasing Ca^{2+} doping (this will be discussed further below). Neutron-diffraction studies at high pressure could address such pressure-induced magnetic ordering.

T_{c} versus P for all specimens studied herein is not linear and appears to approach a maximum. This is most clearly visible in the T_{c}(P) data for the x\!=\!0.4 specimen show in Fig. 3(b). Measurements to pressures above the limitations of our experimental apparatus would be useful to investigate if T_{c}(P) does indeed develop a negative slope at pressures above 1.8 GPa. An estimate of the pressure P(T_{c}(\max)) where T_{c} may reach its maximum can be obtained by fitting the T_{c} versus P data with second-order polynomials; the values P(T_{c}(\max))\!=\!2.2, 2.0, and 1.7 GPa for the x\!=\!0.21, 0.33, and 0.40 specimens, respectively are obtained. In Fig. 4 the dT_{c}/dP (left abscissa) versus x data and the P(T_{c}(\max)) (right abscissa) versus x data are shown; these data will be discussed below.

An interesting feature of the data (neglecting the unusual behavior of the x\!=\!0.40 specimen below 250 K) is that the influence of pressure on \rho qualitatively resembles the influence of magnetic field on \rho (at zero pressure).[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] In addition, measurements of \rho(T,\!H) by Khazeni _et al.[18]_ on Pb-doped single crystals of La(Pb)MnO_{3} indicate that pressure also reduces the Mr effect. Thus the decrease of \rho under application of pressure not only mimics the effect of magnetic field, it also destroys the anomalously large magnetoresistance of this system. Apparently, a reduction in volume erodes the unusual physical state which is responsible for the anomalously large magnetoresistance. These observations establish the importance of changes in volume (i.e, pressure) for not only electrical transport, but magnetotransport as well.

According to the DE model, transfer of charge carriers from site to site mediates the ferromagnetic exchange.[3, 5] The transfer integral for electrical conduction between neighboring Mn sites is approximated by t_{\rm eff}\!=\!t_{0} cos \{\Theta/2\}; when the angle \Theta between two neighboring spins is zero (i.e., ferromagnetic alignment) t_{\rm eff} is maximized. It follows from this model that the dramatic decrease of \rho with decreasing temperature near T_{c} (i.e., as \Theta goes to zero) _at zero pressure_ occurs as a result of broadening of the bandwidth, which is proportional to t_{\rm eff}, resulting in an increase of charge-carrier mobility. Pressure would be expected to increase t_{0}, whereas H and T would affect the degree of magnetic order and in turn the cos\{\Theta/2\} term.

The sensitivity of the electrical resistivity to pressure near T_{c} is particularly strong. This is in part due to the pressure-induced rapid movement of T_{c} toward higher temperatures, but it is mainly a result of particular sensitivity of \rho in the neighborhood of T_{c} to pressure. This is seen most clearly in the x\!=\!0.21 specimen where the activation energy and \rho decrease with pressure. As mentioned above, pressure and magnetic field have similar effects on \rho through their respective influences on t_{\rm eff}. The resistivity above T_{c} can be considered as arising from the propagation of magnetic polarons,[6, 8, 12, 13] which move via thermally activated hopping. The bandwidth for a polaron is given by J_{B}\!\!-\!\exp(-\alpha R) where \alpha is a constant and R is the distance between two neighboring polarons.[19] Pressure decreases R and has a strong positive effect on J_{B} (due to its exponential dependence on R) thereby increasing the charge-carrier mobility and decreasing \rho. The pressure-induced increase of charge-carrier mobility would increase t_{0} and be partly responsible for enhancing the DE ferromagnetic coupling strength which increases T_{c}.

In Fig. 4dT_{c}/dP is observed to drop off strongly with increasing x and pass through an apparent minimum while P(T_{c}(\max)) moves to lower pressures with increasing x suggesting the development of a peak in T_{c} versus P at high x. The largest dT_{c}/dP and d\rho/dP values occur for the specimen with the highest electrical resistivity (and lowest value of x). These observations indicate that the pressure dependence of T_{c} is a strong function of the doping level and are reminiscent of effects observed in high-temperature superconductors[20] where the total charge-carrier concentration n increases with pressure. In the present work a limited number of dT_{c}/dP versus x data points and a lack of experimental information about n(P), precludes a reasonable analysis in this regard; future investigations should address this aspect. At this stage it appears reasonable that n(P) could be nonzero, this would also enhance the ferromagnetic DE coupling and decrease \rho.

The observed values of dT_{c}/dP are larger than those for other ferromagnetic materials such as SrRuO_{3} (also a perovskite with dT_{c}/dP\!\mapsto\!-5.7 K/GPa),[21] Ni (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!+3.2 K/GPa), Fe (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!0), Co (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!0),[22] Sc_{3}In (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!+1.7 K/GPa),[23] but comparable to that observed for ferrimagnets such as Y_{3}Fe_{5}O_{12} (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!+12.5 K/GPa).[22] Experiments on Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3} (Ref. [24]) showed that the pressure dependence of the Neel temperature were in the range dT_{N}/dP\!\mapsto\!+4 K/GPa; this is five to ten times weaker than in the ferromagnetic specimens investigated herein. In this case the ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction is presumably more highly pressure dependent than direct (or super-) exchange (assumed responsible for the antiferromagnetism) in similar compounds because, in addition

  to the normal effects of pressure, double exchange depends directly on the charge-carrier mobility and number of total charge carriers which in this system increase with P. In addition, large values of dT_{c}/dP suggest that strong magneto-volume effects will be observed in these materials.

An interesting observation is that the larger A=Sr and Ba ions, when substituted for Ca in La_{1-x}A_{x}MnO_{3} possess higher values of T_{c}. This is contrary to chemical pressure considerations which would argue that, since dT_{c}/dP is strongly positive for the A=Ca specimens, a larger A ion should result in a _lower_T_{c}. This discrepancy was discussed in early studies on Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3} (Refs. [24] and [25]) as arising from the fact that Ca is more covalent than Sr and hence Ca competes with the Mn-O-Mn interaction; such covalency could be expected to make dT_{c}/dP less positive. In such a framework, La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3} would have larger positive values of dT_{c}/dP than A=Ca specimens. Early \chi_{\rm ac} studies on ferromagnetic La_{0.75}Sr_{0.25}MnO_{3} show [26] that dT_{c}/dP = + 6 K/GPa, which is smaller than the values observed therein. Perhaps the more important factor in determining T_{c} is the Mn-O-Mn bond angle, which systematically varies with the A-ion size, and was recently observed to reduce the magnetic exchange and electron hopping as the angle decreased from 180^{\circ}. [27] Future structural investigations under pressure could address the exact influence of P on the La_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_{3} crystal structure.

In summary, values of dT_{c}/dP in La_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_{3} are significantly larger than in conventional ferromagnets, and about eight times stronger than dT_{N}/dP in Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}. The electrical resistivity is also strongly reduced by the application of pressure and dT_{c}/dP is a strong function of x indicating that pressure increases charge-carrier mobility and total charge-carrier concentration which in turn enhance the ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction and T_{c}. This work establishes pressure as an important variable for large MR perovskites.

These observations indicate that the pressure dependence of T_{c} is a strong function of the doping level and are reminiscent of effects observed in high-temperature superconductors[20] where the total charge-carrier concentration n increases with pressure. In the present work a limited number of dT_{c}/dP versus x data points and a lack of experimental information about n(P), precludes a reasonable analysis in this regard; future investigations should address this aspect. At this stage it appears reasonable that n(P) could be nonzero, this would also enhance the ferromagnetic DE coupling and decrease \rho.

The observed values of dT_{c}/dP are larger than those for other ferromagnetic materials such as SrRuO_{3} (also a perovskite with dT_{c}/dP\!\mapsto\!-5.7 K/GPa),[21] Ni (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!+3.2 K/GPa), Fe (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!0), Co (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!0),[22] Sc_{3}In (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!+1.7 K/GPa),[23] but comparable to that observed for ferrimagnets such as Y_{3}Fe_{5}O_{12} (dT_{c}/dP\!=\!+12.5 K/GPa).[22] Experiments on Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3} (Ref. [24]) showed that the pressure dependence of the Neel temperature were in the range dT_{N}/dP\!\mapsto\!+4 K/GPa; this is five to ten times weaker than in the ferromagnetic specimens investigated herein. In this case the ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction is presumably more highly pressure dependent than direct (or super-) exchange (assumed responsible for the antiferromagnetism) in similar compounds because, in addition

  to the normal effects of pressure, double exchange depends directly on the charge-carrier mobility and number of total charge carriers which in this system increase with P. In addition, large values of dT_{c}/dP suggest that strong magneto-volume effects will be observed in these materials.

An interesting observation is that the larger A=Sr and Ba ions, when substituted for Ca in La_{1-x}A_{x}MnO_{3} possess higher values of T_{c}. This is contrary to chemical pressure considerations which would argue that, since dT_{c}/dP is strongly positive for the A=Ca specimens, a larger A ion should result in a _lower_T_{c}. This discrepancy was discussed in early studies on Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3} (Refs. [24] and [25]) as arising from the fact that Ca is more covalent than Sr and hence Ca competes with the Mn-O-Mn interaction; such covalency could be expected to make dT_{c}/dP less positive. In such a framework, La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3} would have larger positive values of dT_{c}/dP than A=Ca specimens. Early \chi_{\rm ac} studies on ferromagnetic La_{0.75}Sr_{0.25}MnO_{3} show [26] that dT_{c}/dP = + 6 K/GPa, which is smaller than the values observed therein. Perhaps the more important factor in determining T_{c} is the Mn-O-Mn bond angle, which systematically varies with the A-ion size, and was recently observed to reduce the magnetic exchange and electron hopping as the angle decreased from 180^{\circ}. [27] Future structural investigations under pressure could address the exact influence of P on the La_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_{3} crystal structure.

In summary, values of dT_{c}/dP in La_{1-x}Ca_{x}MnO_{3} are significantly larger than in conventional ferromagnets, and about eight times stronger than dT_{N}/dP in Ca_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3}. The electrical resistivity is also strongly reduced by the application of pressure and dT_{c}/dP is a strong function of x indicating that pressure increases charge-carrier mobility and total charge-carrier concentration which in turn enhance the ferromagnetic double-exchange interaction and T_{c}. This work establishes pressure as an important variable for large MR perovskites.
