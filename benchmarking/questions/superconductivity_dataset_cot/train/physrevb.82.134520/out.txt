###### Abstract

Superconductivity and structural characterization is reported for the Heusler structure compounds ScRh_{2}Sn, LuRh_{2}Sn, and YRh_{2}Sn. The superconducting T_{\rm c}'s are 2.0 K, 2.9 K, and 4.1 K, respectively. The electronic contributions to the specific heat and the Debye temperatures are reported, and suggest that the observed trend in T_{\rm c} is governed primarily by an increase in electron-phonon coupling on going from ScRh_{2}Sn to YRh_{2}Sn. The electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm sp} and the normalized specific-heat jump \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} suggest that the _M_Rh_{2}Sn system evolves from weak coupling to moderate coupling superconductivity.

## I Introduction

A large number of ternary intermetallic compounds are known to form in the Heusler and half-Heusler structure types. These compounds display interesting physical properties, ranging from high Seebeck coefficient thermoelectrics,^{1,2} to half metallic ferromagnets,^{3,4} to superconductivity,^{5-8} and have recently been proposed as hosts for topological surface states.^{9,10} The prototype of the family, AlCu_{2}Mn, was studied at the beginning of the last century by Friedrich Heusler.^{11} The Heusler alloys, also called full Heuslers, crystallize in the cubic L2_{1} structure and have the general formula AT_{2}M. In the formula, A stands for d transition metals such as Y, Sc, Ti, Hf, Zr, Nb, and Mn but some of the smallest rare-earth elements form the compound as well. T is a transition metal from groups VIIIIB and IB of the periodic table and M stands for sp metals and the metalloids Sb and Bi.^{12}

Among more than half-thousand reported Heusler compounds, fewer than 30 are superconductors, all with rather low transition temperatures. The Pd-based Heusler superconductors YPd_{2}Sn, LuPd_{2}Sn, and ScPd_{2}Sn are among the first discovered superconductors in this family.^{5,13} we report that the analogous Rh-based compounds YRh_{2}Sn, LuRh_{2}Sn, and ScRh_{2}Sn are superconducting, with T_{\rm c}'s in the range of 2-4 K. We also report an elementary band-structure calculation for the Y-based compound. Comparison of the measured properties suggests that variation in the electron-phonon coupling in the series is an important factor in determining the observed trend in T_{\rm c}.

## II Experimental

The polycrystalline samples were prepared by arc melting mixtures of the pure elements (2-5 % excess Sn was used to compensate for volatilization) in an ultrapure argon atmosphere. Special care was taken to avoid oxygen contamination. The samples were annealed afterward at 750 ^{\circ}C in evacuated quartz tubes. This temperature was held for a week before the tubes were quenched in -13 ^{\circ}C brine to minimize possible structural disorder.^{8} The samples were characterized before and after annealing by powder x-ray diffraction, performed on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer with Cu K_{\alpha} radiation (\lambda = 0.15460 nm). Rietveld refinements of the structures were achieved using GSAS.^{14,15}

dc magnetic measurements were performed using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design). ac magnetic measurements, heat capacity, and ac electrical resistivity (60 Hz) were measured in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System. For the heat-capacity measurements, a standard relaxation calorimetry method was used. For the resistivity measurements we used a standard four-probe technique, with four platinum wires spot welded to the surface of previously polished samples. The electronic structure of YPd_{2}Sn was calculated using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method in the elk implementation.^{16} The generalized gradient approximation was used with parameters from Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof for the exchange-correlation functional.^{17} A grid of 25 \times 25 \times 25 points was used as the basis of the k-space vectors.

## III Results and Discussion

### Structural characterization

Both resistivity and magnetization tests indicate that for ScRh_{2}Sn and LuRh_{2}Sn the annealing process improves the superconducting properties and the crystallinity of the Heusler phase, whereas the same treatment for YRh_{2}Sn induces partial chemical decomposition of the Heusler phase and degrades the superconductivity. Therefore in this paper we present the physical and crystallographic properties of assembled, quenched YRh_{2}Sn, and annealed ScRh_{2}Sn and LuRh_{2}Sn.

The _M_Rh_{2}Sn (_M_ = Sc, Y, Lu) compounds crystallize in the Heusler structure, shown in the inset of Fig. 1. In the cubic L2_{1} Heusler structure, space group Fm\overline{3}m, the M atom oc cupies site 4a (0,0,0), Rh occupies site 8c (\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}), and Sn occupies site 4b (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}). Figure 1 shows as an example the powder XRD pattern for as-cast YRh_{2}Sn; all atomic positions are fixed by symmetry and other structural parameters were freely refined in the fit. Refined lattice are 6.7139(2) A, 6.6417(3) A, and 6.5079(5) A for YRh_{2}Sn, LuRh_{2}Sn, and ScRh_{2}Sn, respectively. These numbers are very close to the reported lattice parameters for the corresponding _M_Pd_{2}Sn compounds.[13] The relative covalent radii of Y, Lu, and Sc account for the respective unit-cell sizes.

### Properties of the superconducting state

The superconducting transition for all _M_Rh_{2}Sn (_M_ = Y,Lu,Sc) samples was initially characterized via measurements of ac susceptibility. Figure 2 presents ac susceptibility versus temperature with the applied \mu_{0}H_{\rm dc} field 0.5 mT and \mu_{0}H_{\rm ac} field 0.3 mT. A very sharp onset of superconductivity (T_{\rm c}) is observed for both ScRh_{2}Sn and LuRh_{2}Sn, whereas for YRh_{2}Sn the transition is broader; \Delta T_{\rm c} is about 0.4 K. Table 1 summarizes crystallographic data and superconducting critical temperatures for _M_Rh_{2}Sn and previously reported _M_Pd_{2}Sn (_M_ = Y,Lu,Sc) compounds. Similarly to _M_Pd_{2}Sn, the highest T_{\rm c} is found for YRh_{2}Sn and decreases as the lattice parameter decreases on proceeding from Y to Lu to Sc. The same observation was made in the Pd-based phases[18] and for Y_{\rightarrow}Pd_{2}Sn_{\rightarrow} under pressure.[19]

To estimate the demagnetization factor (d) for the studied samples, measurements of the low-field magnetization as a function of field _M_(_H_) were performed at various temperatures below T_{\rm c}. A representative measurement at 2 K for YRh_{2}Sn is shown in the main panel of Fig. 3. Assuming that the initial linear response to a magnetic field of less than 5 mT is perfectly diamagnetic, that is, that the slope _dM_/_dH_ is -1/4\pi, we obtain a demagnetization factor that is consistent with the sample's shape. Applying this demagnetization factor, and calculating the volume of the sample (based on refined lattice parameter), gives the maximum observed zero-field cooling susceptibility of approximately -1.02(1/4\pi) for YRh_{2}Sn. A somewhat smaller value, possibly caused by the presence of a small amount of impurities, was obtained for LuRh_{2}Sn [-0.92(1/4\pi)]. Due to the low superconducting temperature for ScRh_{2}Sn, a similar analysis was not possible in that case.

As shown in the main panel of Fig. 3, _M_(_H_) for YRh_{2}Sn, begins to deviate from a fitted linear dependence on \mu_{0}H at a field \mu_{0}H^{\prime} = 6.2 mT, giving a lower critical field, taking into account the demagnetization factor, of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(2 K) = \mu_{0}H^{\prime}/(1-d) = 7.0 \pm 1.2 mT. The estimated uncertainty reflects the criteria that \mu_{0}H^{\prime} is either the field above which M first deviates from the fitted line or the field where M deviates by 2.5% above the fitted curve. The resulting \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} vs T behavior is plotted in the inset of Fig. 3, allowing the estimation of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0) for YRh_{2}Sn as 9.8 mT assuming the form \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(T) = \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}].

The superconducting transition of _M_Rh_{2}Sn was further examined through measurements of the electrical resistivity; the results are shown in the main panel of Fig. 4. The critical temperatures estimated from these measurements are very close to those estimated from M_{\infty}(T). A very sharp transition is visible for all compounds, an indication of the good quality of the samples. However, the normal-state resistivity measured just above T_{\rm c} is almost 2.5 times larger for YRh_{2}Sn than it is for LuRh_{2}Sn and ScRh_{2}Sn. This is likely caused by the fact that the YRh_{2}Sn sample was not annealed after melting, and some residual structural disorder remains present. Similarly, the reported residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is the smallest for YRh_{2}Sn, RRR=1.4, compared to RRR=2.4 and 2.1 for LuRh_{2}Sn and ScRh_{2}Sn, respectively. These rather low values of RRR are typical for Heusler compound, in

The upper critical-field values, H_{\rm c2}, were determined from electrical resistivity measurements under various magnetic fields, presented in the inset of Fig. 5. As shown by the dashed line in Fig. 5, the temperature dependence of H_{\rm c2} is well described by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression for a dirty type-II superconductor, [20] giving \mu_{\rm o}H_{\rm c2}(0)=1.2 T for YRh_{2}Sn. Knowing the values of H_{\rm c1} and H_{\rm c2}, we can calculate several superconducting parameters for YRh_{2}Sn. Using the Ginzburg-Landau formula for coherence length \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=[\phi_{\rm o}/2\pi H_{\rm c2}(0)]1/2, where \phi_{\rm o} is the flux quantum h/2e, we find \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=16 nm. With these results for \xi_{\rm GL}(0) and H_{\rm c1}, the penetration depth, \lambda_{\rm GL}(0)=207 nm is obtained from \mu_{\rm o}H_{\rm c1}=\frac{\Phi_{\rm D}}{4\pi\lambda_{\rm GL}}\frac{\lambda_{\rm GL}}{\xi_{\rm GL}}, and, hence the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa\approx13, which suggests that YRh_{2}Sn is a type-II superconductor.

The heat capacity measured through the superconducting transition is shown for all three compounds in Fig. 6. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by sharp, large anomalies at temperatures that are consistent with the T_{\rm c}'s determined by magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. Measured heat capacities at an applied field of \mu_{\rm o}H=3 T, which exceeds the upper critical-field values, were fitted using the formula C_{\rm p}= \gamma T+ \beta T^{3}+ \delta T^{5} in which the first and two last parameters are attributed to electronic and lattice contribution to the specific heat, respectively. The extracted Sommerfeld coefficients, \gamma, are very close to the values obtained for the analogous compounds in the MPd_{2}Sn family, [19, 21] and are in the range typical of the Heusler materials.

A simple Debye model for the phonon contribution to the specific heat dictates that \beta is related to the Debye temperature through \Theta_{\rm D}=(\frac{12\pi^{2}}{5\beta}nR)1/3, where R=8.314 J/mol K, and n=4 is the number of atoms in the formula unit. Using the observed values of \beta, we find that the Debye temperature is highest for ScRh_{2}Sn (\Theta_{\rm D}=282 K) and lowest for YRh_{2}Sn (\Theta_{\rm D}=219 K), which deviates from a simple mass relationship because the Debye temperature of significantly heavier LuRh_{2}Sn (\Theta_{\rm D}=228 K) falls between these two values. This suggests the presence of relatively stiff Lu-Rh bonds. Interestingly, a similar trend is observed in the Pd-based Heusler superconductors.

With these results, assuming \mu^{\star}=0.13, the electron-phonon coupling constant (\lambda_{\rm qp}) can be calculated from the McMillan relation, [22]

The lower left inset is the temperature dependence of the lower critical field (\mu_{\rm o}H_{\rm c1}) for YRh_{2}Sn.

  \[T_{\rm c}=\frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45}\exp\left[\frac{-1.04(1+\lambda_{\rm ep})}{ \lambda_{\rm ep}-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda_{\rm ep})}\right].\]

By comparing the values of \lambda_{\rm ep} obtained, we conclude that the MRh_{2}Sn system evolves from weak coupling to moderate coupling superconductivity, as \lambda_{\rm ep} increases from 0.52 to 0.59 to 0.66 on proceeding from ScRh_{2}Sn to LuRh_{2}Sn to YRh_{2}Sn. Similarly, YRh_{2}Sn is more strongly correlated than the Lu analog when comparing their normalized specific-heat jumps \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}, a ratio that is often used as a test of the coupling strength.[23, 24] The value \lambda_{\rm ep}=0.66 obtained for YRh_{2}Sn is, to our knowledge, the highest reported for the Heusler compounds. Interestingly, taking the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D}=179 K and the superconducting temperature T_{\rm c}=4.8 K of YPd_{2}Sn (see Table 1) we obtain an even higher \lambda_{\rm ep}=0.75. This suggests that yttrium optimizes the electron-phonon coupling for superconductivity in Heusler phases.

In the framework of the free-electron gas, and including the enhancement of the Sommerfeld parameter by electron-phonon coupling, the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy can be calculated from: N(E_{F})= \frac{1}{\pi^{2}\lambda_{\rm Bj}^{2}(1+\lambda_{\rm ep})}\gamma. The values obtained for all the MRh_{2}Sn (M= Sc, \gamma,Lu) compounds are almost the same \left[N(E_{F})\approx 2\right. state/eV]. This means that a simple relationship between N(E_{F}) and T_{\rm c} is not found in this family as one might expect given the differences in \lambda_{\rm ep}.

The specific-heat data shown in Fig. 6 provide additional information on the superconductivity in these materials. While the finite residual linear term seen in the ScRh_{2}Sn, could be taken as an indication of nodes or multiband superconducting gap behavior, it is more likely due to a sample which does not possess complete superconductivity. Independent of this, from the temperature dependence of the specific heat we can extract a value for the superconducting gap by fitting the data minus the phonons and the residual linear term to the expected BCS expectation,

\[C_{\rm BCS}=t\frac{d}{dT}\!\!\int_{0}^{\infty}dy\!\left(\frac{-6\gamma\lambda_ {0}}{k_{B}\pi}\right)\!\left[f\ln f+(1-f)\ln(1-f)\right],\]

where t=T/T_{\rm c}, f is the Fermi function f=1/(e^{Et_{B}T}+1), E= \sqrt{e^{2}\!+\!\Delta^{2}}, y=e/\Delta(0), and \Delta(T)/\Delta(0) is taken from the tabulated values by Muhlschlegel.[25] The results for YRh_{2}Sn are shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The gap values are 0.70 meV, 0.44 meV, and 0.27 meV for YRh_{2}Sn, LuRh_{2}Sn, and ScRh_{2}Sn, respectively. This yields a ratio of \Delta/k_{B}T_{\rm c}=2.0, 1.8, and 1.6, respectively, compared with the weak-coupling BCS expectation of 1.76 again indicating that YRh_{2}Sn is the strongest coupling superconductor of the three.

### Band-structure calculations

The calculated band-structure results (Fig. 7) are very similar to those found for ZrNi_{2}Ga (Ref. 7) but the Fermi level has moved down in a rigid-bandlike fashion to reflect

  the loss of 2 electrons/f.u.. This suggests that the superconducting state is more dependent on the general electronic features of the Heusler structure type than on the exact electronic count. The calculated N(E_{F})'s of MRh_{2}Sn are 5.4, 4.8, and 6.0 (states eV^{-1} f.u.^{-1}) for Y, Lu, and Sc, respectively. The inset shows that the Fermi energy is predicted to be quite close to a peak in the DOS. Most of the electronic density around this peak is associated with a low dispersion band which is primarily Rh 4d in character and occurs along the path from W to K to \Gamma in the Brillouin zone. Small deviations in the dispersion of the contributing bands can move the Fermi level further or closer to the peak, which might explain the deviation in N(E_{F})_{M\text{Rh}2\text{Sn}}/N(E_{F})_{\text{YRh}2\text{Sn}} The calculated values are also more than twice larger than the measured values, indicating that in the actual compound the peak near N(E_{F}) is probably shifted to a slightly higher energy, putting the actual E_{F} closer to the valley in DOS predicted by the band-structure calculations. Due to the sharpness of the peak in the DOS, a deviation of \sim0.2 eV would reproduce the experimentally determined N(E_{F}). This discrepancy could be caused by either a slight decrease in 4d band dispersion, which shifts more states toward the center of the band, or loss of <0.5 electron/f.u. which corresponds to \sim2% vacancies on the Rh site.

## IV Conclusions

One of the predictions of the BCS theory is the relationship between the superconducting critical temperature and three material parameters: T_{\text{c}} = 1.13\Theta_{\text{D}} exp[-1/VN(E_{F})], where \Theta_{\text{D}} is the Debye temperature, N(E_{F}) is the density of states at the Fermi energy, and V is the electron-electron attractive interaction. Comparing the Debye temperatures for all six members of the MT_{2}Sn superconducting family (M = Sc, Y,Lu, T = Rh, Pd), we should expect the highest critical temperature for the compounds with the lightest M element: ScRh_{2}Sn and ScPd_{2}Sn. However, the measured T_{\text{c}}'s, as shown in the Table 1, do not display this trend, which means that the Debye temperature is not the dominant parameter. The observed Sommerfeld parameters, a reflection of a dressed density of states (1 + \lambda_{\text{ep}})N(E_{F}), do, however trace the trend in T_{\text{c}}'s.

As can be observed in Table 2, the calculated N(E_{F}) values increase by 18%, comparing values of N(E_{F}) for YRh_{2}Sn and ScRh_{2}Sn, suggesting that the electronic structure can account for the observations. The last parameter to consider is the electron-electron attractive interaction (V), which in fact reflects the strength of the electron-phonon interaction in the material. We can compare this interaction through the electron phonon coupling constants (\lambda_{\text{ep}}). For MRh_{2}Sn, the superconducting critical temperature, T_{\text{c}}, increases as \lambda_{\text{ep}} increases. The relative change in \lambda_{\text{ep}} is 27% comparing the \lambda_{\text{ep}} values for YRh_{2}Sn and ScRh_{2}Sn. The same behavior can be deduced by comparing T_{\text{c}} and \lambda_{\text{ep}} for the NbNi_{2}M (M = Al, Ga, Sn) family.[26]

For comparison purposes, we show in Table 3 various superconducting parameters for YRh_{2}Sn and the two strong-coupling superconductors Nb_{3}Sn and MgB_{2}. Comparing the numbers helps to explain why T_{\text{c}} in the Heusler system is relatively low. Although the Debye temperatures for Nb_{3}Sn and MgB_{2}

  and YRh_{2}Sn are almost identical, both the electron-phonon coupling constant and the Sommerfeld parameter are much lower (by a factor of 2) for the latter. Interestingly MgB_{2} has smaller Sommerfeld parameter in comparison to YRh_{2}Sn, but the characteristic energy, which replaces Debye temperature,[27] is 30 times larger, resulting in a T_{\rm c} that is almost ten times higher.

In conclusion, in the Heusler family, the trends in superconducting T_{\rm c} appear to be driven primarily by the electron-phonon coupling. Comparing the values of \lambda_{\rm ep} and the normalized specific-heat jump \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} suggests that the MRh_{2}Sn system evolves from weak coupling to moderate coupling superconductivity.

###### Abstract

Superconductivity and structural characterization is reported for the Heusler structure compounds ScRh_{2}Sn, LuRh_{2}Sn, and YRh_{2}Sn. The superconducting T_{\rm c}'s are 2.0 K, 2.9 K, and 4.1 K, respectively. The electronic contributions to the specific heat and the Debye temperatures are reported, and suggest that the observed trend in T_{\rm c} is governed primarily by an increase in electron-phonon coupling on going from ScRh_{2}Sn to YRh_{2}Sn. The electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{\rm sp} and the normalized specific-heat jump \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} suggest that the _M_Rh_{2}Sn system evolves from weak coupling to moderate coupling superconductivity.

## I Introduction

A large number of ternary intermetallic compounds are known to form in the Heusler and half-Heusler structure types. These compounds display interesting physical properties, ranging from high Seebeck coefficient thermoelectrics,^{1,2} to half metallic ferromagnets,^{3,4} to superconductivity,^{5-8} and have recently been proposed as hosts for topological surface states.^{9,10} The prototype of the family, AlCu_{2}Mn, was studied at the beginning of the last century by Friedrich Heusler.^{11} The Heusler alloys, also called full Heuslers, crystallize in the cubic L2_{1} structure and have the general formula AT_{2}M. In the formula, A stands for d transition metals such as Y, Sc, Ti, Hf, Zr, Nb, and Mn but some of the smallest rare-earth elements form the compound as well. T is a transition metal from groups VIIIIB and IB of the periodic table and M stands for sp metals and the metalloids Sb and Bi.^{12}

Among more than half-thousand reported Heusler compounds, fewer than 30 are superconductors, all with rather low transition temperatures. The Pd-based Heusler superconductors YPd_{2}Sn, LuPd_{2}Sn, and ScPd_{2}Sn are among the first discovered superconductors in this family.^{5,13} we report that the analogous Rh-based compounds YRh_{2}Sn, LuRh_{2}Sn, and ScRh_{2}Sn are superconducting, with T_{\rm c}'s in the range of 2-4 K. We also report an elementary band-structure calculation for the Y-based compound. Comparison of the measured properties suggests that variation in the electron-phonon coupling in the series is an important factor in determining the observed trend in T_{\rm c}.

## II Experimental

The polycrystalline samples were prepared by arc melting mixtures of the pure elements (2-5 % excess Sn was used to compensate for volatilization) in an ultrapure argon atmosphere. Special care was taken to avoid oxygen contamination. The samples were annealed afterward at 750 ^{\circ}C in evacuated quartz tubes. This temperature was held for a week before the tubes were quenched in -13 ^{\circ}C brine to minimize possible structural disorder.^{8} The samples were characterized before and after annealing by powder x-ray diffraction, performed on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer with Cu K_{\alpha} radiation (\lambda = 0.15460 nm). Rietveld refinements of the structures were achieved using GSAS.^{14,15}

dc magnetic measurements were performed using a commercial superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (Quantum Design). ac magnetic measurements, heat capacity, and ac electrical resistivity (60 Hz) were measured in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System. For the heat-capacity measurements, a standard relaxation calorimetry method was used. For the resistivity measurements we used a standard four-probe technique, with four platinum wires spot welded to the surface of previously polished samples. The electronic structure of YPd_{2}Sn was calculated using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method in the elk implementation.^{16} The generalized gradient approximation was used with parameters from Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof for the exchange-correlation functional.^{17} A grid of 25 \times 25 \times 25 points was used as the basis of the k-space vectors.

## III Results and Discussion

### Structural characterization

Both resistivity and magnetization tests indicate that for ScRh_{2}Sn and LuRh_{2}Sn the annealing process improves the superconducting properties and the crystallinity of the Heusler phase, whereas the same treatment for YRh_{2}Sn induces partial chemical decomposition of the Heusler phase and degrades the superconductivity. Therefore in this paper we present the physical and crystallographic properties of assembled, quenched YRh_{2}Sn, and annealed ScRh_{2}Sn and LuRh_{2}Sn.

The _M_Rh_{2}Sn (_M_ = Sc, Y, Lu) compounds crystallize in the Heusler structure, shown in the inset of Fig. 1. In the cubic L2_{1} Heusler structure, space group Fm\overline{3}m, the M atom oc cupies site 4a (0,0,0), Rh occupies site 8c (\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}), and Sn occupies site 4b (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}). Figure 1 shows as an example the powder XRD pattern for as-cast YRh_{2}Sn; all atomic positions are fixed by symmetry and other structural parameters were freely refined in the fit. Refined lattice are 6.7139(2) A, 6.6417(3) A, and 6.5079(5) A for YRh_{2}Sn, LuRh_{2}Sn, and ScRh_{2}Sn, respectively. These numbers are very close to the reported lattice parameters for the corresponding _M_Pd_{2}Sn compounds.[13] The relative covalent radii of Y, Lu, and Sc account for the respective unit-cell sizes.

### Properties of the superconducting state

The superconducting transition for all _M_Rh_{2}Sn (_M_ = Y,Lu,Sc) samples was initially characterized via measurements of ac susceptibility. Figure 2 presents ac susceptibility versus temperature with the applied \mu_{0}H_{\rm dc} field 0.5 mT and \mu_{0}H_{\rm ac} field 0.3 mT. A very sharp onset of superconductivity (T_{\rm c}) is observed for both ScRh_{2}Sn and LuRh_{2}Sn, whereas for YRh_{2}Sn the transition is broader; \Delta T_{\rm c} is about 0.4 K. Table 1 summarizes crystallographic data and superconducting critical temperatures for _M_Rh_{2}Sn and previously reported _M_Pd_{2}Sn (_M_ = Y,Lu,Sc) compounds. Similarly to _M_Pd_{2}Sn, the highest T_{\rm c} is found for YRh_{2}Sn and decreases as the lattice parameter decreases on proceeding from Y to Lu to Sc. The same observation was made in the Pd-based phases[18] and for Y_{\rightarrow}Pd_{2}Sn_{\rightarrow} under pressure.[19]

To estimate the demagnetization factor (d) for the studied samples, measurements of the low-field magnetization as a function of field _M_(_H_) were performed at various temperatures below T_{\rm c}. A representative measurement at 2 K for YRh_{2}Sn is shown in the main panel of Fig. 3. Assuming that the initial linear response to a magnetic field of less than 5 mT is perfectly diamagnetic, that is, that the slope _dM_/_dH_ is -1/4\pi, we obtain a demagnetization factor that is consistent with the sample's shape. Applying this demagnetization factor, and calculating the volume of the sample (based on refined lattice parameter), gives the maximum observed zero-field cooling susceptibility of approximately -1.02(1/4\pi) for YRh_{2}Sn. A somewhat smaller value, possibly caused by the presence of a small amount of impurities, was obtained for LuRh_{2}Sn [-0.92(1/4\pi)]. Due to the low superconducting temperature for ScRh_{2}Sn, a similar analysis was not possible in that case.

As shown in the main panel of Fig. 3, _M_(_H_) for YRh_{2}Sn, begins to deviate from a fitted linear dependence on \mu_{0}H at a field \mu_{0}H^{\prime} = 6.2 mT, giving a lower critical field, taking into account the demagnetization factor, of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(2 K) = \mu_{0}H^{\prime}/(1-d) = 7.0 \pm 1.2 mT. The estimated uncertainty reflects the criteria that \mu_{0}H^{\prime} is either the field above which M first deviates from the fitted line or the field where M deviates by 2.5% above the fitted curve. The resulting \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1} vs T behavior is plotted in the inset of Fig. 3, allowing the estimation of \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0) for YRh_{2}Sn as 9.8 mT assuming the form \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(T) = \mu_{0}H_{\rm c1}(0)[1-(T/T_{\rm c})^{2}].

The superconducting transition of _M_Rh_{2}Sn was further examined through measurements of the electrical resistivity; the results are shown in the main panel of Fig. 4. The critical temperatures estimated from these measurements are very close to those estimated from M_{\infty}(T). A very sharp transition is visible for all compounds, an indication of the good quality of the samples. However, the normal-state resistivity measured just above T_{\rm c} is almost 2.5 times larger for YRh_{2}Sn than it is for LuRh_{2}Sn and ScRh_{2}Sn. This is likely caused by the fact that the YRh_{2}Sn sample was not annealed after melting, and some residual structural disorder remains present. Similarly, the reported residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is the smallest for YRh_{2}Sn, RRR=1.4, compared to RRR=2.4 and 2.1 for LuRh_{2}Sn and ScRh_{2}Sn, respectively. These rather low values of RRR are typical for Heusler compound, in

The upper critical-field values, H_{\rm c2}, were determined from electrical resistivity measurements under various magnetic fields, presented in the inset of Fig. 5. As shown by the dashed line in Fig. 5, the temperature dependence of H_{\rm c2} is well described by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression for a dirty type-II superconductor, [20] giving \mu_{\rm o}H_{\rm c2}(0)=1.2 T for YRh_{2}Sn. Knowing the values of H_{\rm c1} and H_{\rm c2}, we can calculate several superconducting parameters for YRh_{2}Sn. Using the Ginzburg-Landau formula for coherence length \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=[\phi_{\rm o}/2\pi H_{\rm c2}(0)]1/2, where \phi_{\rm o} is the flux quantum h/2e, we find \xi_{\rm GL}(0)=16 nm. With these results for \xi_{\rm GL}(0) and H_{\rm c1}, the penetration depth, \lambda_{\rm GL}(0)=207 nm is obtained from \mu_{\rm o}H_{\rm c1}=\frac{\Phi_{\rm D}}{4\pi\lambda_{\rm GL}}\frac{\lambda_{\rm GL}}{\xi_{\rm GL}}, and, hence the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa\approx13, which suggests that YRh_{2}Sn is a type-II superconductor.

The heat capacity measured through the superconducting transition is shown for all three compounds in Fig. 6. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by sharp, large anomalies at temperatures that are consistent with the T_{\rm c}'s determined by magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. Measured heat capacities at an applied field of \mu_{\rm o}H=3 T, which exceeds the upper critical-field values, were fitted using the formula C_{\rm p}= \gamma T+ \beta T^{3}+ \delta T^{5} in which the first and two last parameters are attributed to electronic and lattice contribution to the specific heat, respectively. The extracted Sommerfeld coefficients, \gamma, are very close to the values obtained for the analogous compounds in the MPd_{2}Sn family, [19, 21] and are in the range typical of the Heusler materials.

A simple Debye model for the phonon contribution to the specific heat dictates that \beta is related to the Debye temperature through \Theta_{\rm D}=(\frac{12\pi^{2}}{5\beta}nR)1/3, where R=8.314 J/mol K, and n=4 is the number of atoms in the formula unit. Using the observed values of \beta, we find that the Debye temperature is highest for ScRh_{2}Sn (\Theta_{\rm D}=282 K) and lowest for YRh_{2}Sn (\Theta_{\rm D}=219 K), which deviates from a simple mass relationship because the Debye temperature of significantly heavier LuRh_{2}Sn (\Theta_{\rm D}=228 K) falls between these two values. This suggests the presence of relatively stiff Lu-Rh bonds. Interestingly, a similar trend is observed in the Pd-based Heusler superconductors.

With these results, assuming \mu^{\star}=0.13, the electron-phonon coupling constant (\lambda_{\rm qp}) can be calculated from the McMillan relation, [22]

The lower left inset is the temperature dependence of the lower critical field (\mu_{\rm o}H_{\rm c1}) for YRh_{2}Sn.

  \[T_{\rm c}=\frac{\Theta_{\rm D}}{1.45}\exp\left[\frac{-1.04(1+\lambda_{\rm ep})}{ \lambda_{\rm ep}-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda_{\rm ep})}\right].\]

By comparing the values of \lambda_{\rm ep} obtained, we conclude that the MRh_{2}Sn system evolves from weak coupling to moderate coupling superconductivity, as \lambda_{\rm ep} increases from 0.52 to 0.59 to 0.66 on proceeding from ScRh_{2}Sn to LuRh_{2}Sn to YRh_{2}Sn. Similarly, YRh_{2}Sn is more strongly correlated than the Lu analog when comparing their normalized specific-heat jumps \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c}, a ratio that is often used as a test of the coupling strength.[23, 24] The value \lambda_{\rm ep}=0.66 obtained for YRh_{2}Sn is, to our knowledge, the highest reported for the Heusler compounds. Interestingly, taking the Debye temperature \Theta_{\rm D}=179 K and the superconducting temperature T_{\rm c}=4.8 K of YPd_{2}Sn (see Table 1) we obtain an even higher \lambda_{\rm ep}=0.75. This suggests that yttrium optimizes the electron-phonon coupling for superconductivity in Heusler phases.

In the framework of the free-electron gas, and including the enhancement of the Sommerfeld parameter by electron-phonon coupling, the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy can be calculated from: N(E_{F})= \frac{1}{\pi^{2}\lambda_{\rm Bj}^{2}(1+\lambda_{\rm ep})}\gamma. The values obtained for all the MRh_{2}Sn (M= Sc, \gamma,Lu) compounds are almost the same \left[N(E_{F})\approx 2\right. state/eV]. This means that a simple relationship between N(E_{F}) and T_{\rm c} is not found in this family as one might expect given the differences in \lambda_{\rm ep}.

The specific-heat data shown in Fig. 6 provide additional information on the superconductivity in these materials. While the finite residual linear term seen in the ScRh_{2}Sn, could be taken as an indication of nodes or multiband superconducting gap behavior, it is more likely due to a sample which does not possess complete superconductivity. Independent of this, from the temperature dependence of the specific heat we can extract a value for the superconducting gap by fitting the data minus the phonons and the residual linear term to the expected BCS expectation,

\[C_{\rm BCS}=t\frac{d}{dT}\!\!\int_{0}^{\infty}dy\!\left(\frac{-6\gamma\lambda_ {0}}{k_{B}\pi}\right)\!\left[f\ln f+(1-f)\ln(1-f)\right],\]

where t=T/T_{\rm c}, f is the Fermi function f=1/(e^{Et_{B}T}+1), E= \sqrt{e^{2}\!+\!\Delta^{2}}, y=e/\Delta(0), and \Delta(T)/\Delta(0) is taken from the tabulated values by Muhlschlegel.[25] The results for YRh_{2}Sn are shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The gap values are 0.70 meV, 0.44 meV, and 0.27 meV for YRh_{2}Sn, LuRh_{2}Sn, and ScRh_{2}Sn, respectively. This yields a ratio of \Delta/k_{B}T_{\rm c}=2.0, 1.8, and 1.6, respectively, compared with the weak-coupling BCS expectation of 1.76 again indicating that YRh_{2}Sn is the strongest coupling superconductor of the three.

### Band-structure calculations

The calculated band-structure results (Fig. 7) are very similar to those found for ZrNi_{2}Ga (Ref. 7) but the Fermi level has moved down in a rigid-bandlike fashion to reflect

  the loss of 2 electrons/f.u.. This suggests that the superconducting state is more dependent on the general electronic features of the Heusler structure type than on the exact electronic count. The calculated N(E_{F})'s of MRh_{2}Sn are 5.4, 4.8, and 6.0 (states eV^{-1} f.u.^{-1}) for Y, Lu, and Sc, respectively. The inset shows that the Fermi energy is predicted to be quite close to a peak in the DOS. Most of the electronic density around this peak is associated with a low dispersion band which is primarily Rh 4d in character and occurs along the path from W to K to \Gamma in the Brillouin zone. Small deviations in the dispersion of the contributing bands can move the Fermi level further or closer to the peak, which might explain the deviation in N(E_{F})_{M\text{Rh}2\text{Sn}}/N(E_{F})_{\text{YRh}2\text{Sn}} The calculated values are also more than twice larger than the measured values, indicating that in the actual compound the peak near N(E_{F}) is probably shifted to a slightly higher energy, putting the actual E_{F} closer to the valley in DOS predicted by the band-structure calculations. Due to the sharpness of the peak in the DOS, a deviation of \sim0.2 eV would reproduce the experimentally determined N(E_{F}). This discrepancy could be caused by either a slight decrease in 4d band dispersion, which shifts more states toward the center of the band, or loss of <0.5 electron/f.u. which corresponds to \sim2% vacancies on the Rh site.

## IV Conclusions

One of the predictions of the BCS theory is the relationship between the superconducting critical temperature and three material parameters: T_{\text{c}} = 1.13\Theta_{\text{D}} exp[-1/VN(E_{F})], where \Theta_{\text{D}} is the Debye temperature, N(E_{F}) is the density of states at the Fermi energy, and V is the electron-electron attractive interaction. Comparing the Debye temperatures for all six members of the MT_{2}Sn superconducting family (M = Sc, Y,Lu, T = Rh, Pd), we should expect the highest critical temperature for the compounds with the lightest M element: ScRh_{2}Sn and ScPd_{2}Sn. However, the measured T_{\text{c}}'s, as shown in the Table 1, do not display this trend, which means that the Debye temperature is not the dominant parameter. The observed Sommerfeld parameters, a reflection of a dressed density of states (1 + \lambda_{\text{ep}})N(E_{F}), do, however trace the trend in T_{\text{c}}'s.

As can be observed in Table 2, the calculated N(E_{F}) values increase by 18%, comparing values of N(E_{F}) for YRh_{2}Sn and ScRh_{2}Sn, suggesting that the electronic structure can account for the observations. The last parameter to consider is the electron-electron attractive interaction (V), which in fact reflects the strength of the electron-phonon interaction in the material. We can compare this interaction through the electron phonon coupling constants (\lambda_{\text{ep}}). For MRh_{2}Sn, the superconducting critical temperature, T_{\text{c}}, increases as \lambda_{\text{ep}} increases. The relative change in \lambda_{\text{ep}} is 27% comparing the \lambda_{\text{ep}} values for YRh_{2}Sn and ScRh_{2}Sn. The same behavior can be deduced by comparing T_{\text{c}} and \lambda_{\text{ep}} for the NbNi_{2}M (M = Al, Ga, Sn) family.[26]

For comparison purposes, we show in Table 3 various superconducting parameters for YRh_{2}Sn and the two strong-coupling superconductors Nb_{3}Sn and MgB_{2}. Comparing the numbers helps to explain why T_{\text{c}} in the Heusler system is relatively low. Although the Debye temperatures for Nb_{3}Sn and MgB_{2}

  and YRh_{2}Sn are almost identical, both the electron-phonon coupling constant and the Sommerfeld parameter are much lower (by a factor of 2) for the latter. Interestingly MgB_{2} has smaller Sommerfeld parameter in comparison to YRh_{2}Sn, but the characteristic energy, which replaces Debye temperature,[27] is 30 times larger, resulting in a T_{\rm c} that is almost ten times higher.

In conclusion, in the Heusler family, the trends in superconducting T_{\rm c} appear to be driven primarily by the electron-phonon coupling. Comparing the values of \lambda_{\rm ep} and the normalized specific-heat jump \Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm c} suggests that the MRh_{2}Sn system evolves from weak coupling to moderate coupling superconductivity.
