###### Abstract

We have investigated the nature of the superconducting ground state of Cu0.06TiSe2 using muon spin rotation and muon spin relaxation measurements. The temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of Cu0.06TiSe2 is consistent with a single gap _s_-wave BCS superconductor in the clean limit. The gap energy is \Delta(0)=0.27(1) meV, which corresponds to a gap to T_{C} ratio of [2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{C}]=2.5. The estimated magnetic penetration depth, \lambda, and the coherence length, \xi, are 660(10) and 15(5) nm, respectively. Furthermore, we observe an irreversibility line in the temperature dependence of the superconducting part of the muon relaxation rate, \sigma_{sc}(T), indicating the presence of strong pinning in Cu0.06TiSe2. Interestingly, at low temperatures we have found clear evidence of the presence of low-energy spin fluctuations that coexist with superconductivity and have an Arrhenius temperature dependence.

 plate and a small amount of diluted GE varnish was added to aid thermal contact. The sample and mount were then inserted into a dilution fridge with a temperature range of 50 mK to 4 K. Any Ag exposed to the muon beam would give a flat time independent background or a nondecaying sine wave for longitudinal or transverse geometry measurement respectively. The amount of GE varnish was so small such it did not contribute to a \muSR signal.

The TF-\muSR experiment was conducted with applied fields between 5 and 60 mT, which ensured that the sample was in the mixed state. Each field was either applied above the superconducting transition and the sample was then cooled to base temperature [field cooled (FC)] or the sample was first cooled to base temperature and then the field was applied [zero field cooled (ZFC)]. The MuSR spectrometer comprises 64 detectors. In software, each detector is normalized for the muon decay and reduced into a real and imaginary component. The resulting two spectra were simultaneously fitted with a sinusoidal oscillating function with the relaxation Gaussian component,

\[G_{xx}(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{2}A_{i}\exp(-\frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}\sigma_{i}^{2}}{2})\cos (2\,\pi\nu_{i}t+\varphi_{real,imag})\] (1)

where the ith index denotes the contribution from the superconducting and background phases, respectively, A_{i} is the initial asymmetry, \sigma_{i} is the Gaussian relaxation rate, \nu_{i} is the muon spin precessional frequency, and \varphi is the phase offset. Figure 2 shows typical spectra for Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} with an applied field of 5 mT at 0.1 K after being FC. The inset in Fig. 2 is the field distribution as determined using a maximum entropy technique.[19] This shows that the data can be well described using two Gaussian field profiles. Such an asymmetric line shape could be the result of a highly anisotropic superconductor. However, a simpler explanation, consistent with the size of the sample can be given. The sharper peak centered at the applied field is the Ag contribution and the broader peak shifted from the applied field is the contribution associated with the flux line lattice. It is likely that the Ag peak has probably been broadened due to the inhomogeneous field from flux exclusion in the superconductor.

The \sigma_{1} value measured while in the superconducting state, \sigma_{sc} is a convolution of both the flux line lattice and the nuclear moments. The contribution from the nuclear moments has been determined at a temperature just above T_{C} and has been assumed to be constant. This assumption is justified later by the longitudinal zero field \muSR experiment. Figure 3 shows the field dependence of \sigma_{sc} at 0.1 K. Each data point was collected after field cooling the sample from above T_{C}. As the field is increased \sigma_{sc} decreases, this is caused by the overlapping of the flux lines. The data can be well described using the modified London model,

The inset is the field distribution as determined using a Maximum Entropy technique. The points are the results from the maximum entropy and the lines are the Gaussian line shapes. This shows that the data can be well described using two Gaussian field profiles.

  \[\sqrt{\Delta B^{2}}=2\sigma_{sc}^{2}/\gamma_{\mu}^{2}=B_{0}\sqrt{\sum_{h,k}\frac{ \exp(-\xi^{2}q_{h,k}^{2})}{\left(1+\frac{q_{h,k}^{2}\lambda^{2}}{1-b}\right)^{2 }}},\] (2)

where B_{0} is the mean internal field, b=B_{0}/B_{C2}, and the sum is over all nonzero reciprocal-lattice vectors, q_{h,k} of the hexagonal flux line lattice. The results of the fit gives \lambda = 660(10) nm and \xi_{0}=15(5) nm and thus yields a Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \kappa=\lambda/\xi=44 indicating that Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} is an extreme type-II superconductor. Using these results together with the heat capacity then we find that n_{s} and m^{*}/m_{e} of 4.8\times 10^{26} m^{-3} and 7.5, respectively. For further details on these calculations see Ref. [20].

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of \sigma_{sc} for both ZFC and FC. As is clearly seen \sigma_{sc} for the ZFC and FC separates at 2.0 K. A similar effect [see Fig. 4 (inset)] is seen if the field is increased to 20 and 40 mT where the separation temperature is 1.0 and 0.5 K. This suggests that there is an irreversibility line in Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} indicating the presence of strong pinning in Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2}. A similar irreversibility has also been observed in the \muSR depolarization rate of Mo_{3}Sb_{7} (T_{C}=2.2 K), which reveals two BCS-type superconducting gaps.[21]

Now we present a detailed analysis of the FC \sigma_{sc} and, as we can be sure of a stable flux line lattice, the data have been analyzed within the dirty- and the clean-limit approaches. In the dirty-limit theory 1/\lambda^{2}(T) has the form[22]

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=\frac{\sigma(T)}{\sigma(0)}=\frac{ \Delta(T)}{\Delta(0)}\mathrm{tanh}\Bigg{[}\frac{\Delta(T)}{2k_{B}T}\Bigg{]},\] (3)

whereas in the clean limit it has the form

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}=\frac{\sigma(T)}{\sigma(0)}=1+2\int_{ \Delta(T)}^{\infty}\Bigg{(}\frac{\partial f}{\partial E}\Bigg{)}\frac{E}{ \sqrt{E^{2}-\Delta(T)^{2}}}dE,\] (4)

where f=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} which is the Fermi function. For both models, the temperature dependence of the gap was approximated by[23]

\[\Delta(T)=\Delta(0)\mathrm{tanh}\{1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T-1)]^{0.51}\}.\] (5)

As can be seen from Fig. 4 the FC data are best described by the clean-limit theory and not the dirty limit, (as seen in the thermal conductivity[13]), which does not have the correct temperature dependence. The results of the fit to the clean limit give a \Delta(0)=0.27(1) meV which corresponds to a gap to T_{C} ratio of [2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{C}]=2.5, which is significantly less than the predicted BCS value of 3.5. This implies that Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} is a weakly coupled superconductor. It is possible for superconductors, in particular HTSC,[24, 25] with impurities to appear s-wave but actually have a different symmetry, however, we do not have any detectable impurities in our sample and therefore conclude that our data are consistent with Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} being a weakly coupled s-wave superconductor in the clean limit.

Now we discuss the results of our zero field \muSR measurements of Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2}. The muon spin relaxation for a metallic system that does not exhibit magnetic order will only be sensitive to the local fields associated with the nuclear spins. Normally, on the time scale of the muon, these nuclear spins are static and randomly orientated. Therefore, the \muSR spectra can be described by the Kubo-Toyabe function[26]

\[G_{z}^{KT}(t)=\Bigg{[}\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}(1-\xi^{2}t^{2})\exp(-\frac{\xi ^{2}t^{2}}{2})\Bigg{]},\] (6)

where \zeta/\gamma_{\mu} is the local-field distribution width and \gamma_{\mu}/2\,\pi = 135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio. In the magnetically ordered state, the muon polarization will precess with a frequency which is directly proportional to the ordered moment. However, if the internal field is small, or if there is a broad distribution of local fields then an increase in the relaxation rate should be observed and could be described by an exponential decay. The spectrum from Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} are best described [see Fig. 5 (inset)] by

Furthermore, we observe an irreversibility line in the temperature dependence of the superconducting part of the muon relaxation rate, \sigma_{sc}(T), indicating the presence of strong pinning in Cu0.06TiSe2.

The results of the fit gives \lambda = 660(10) nm and \xi_{0}=15(5) nm and thus yields a Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \kappa=\lambda/\xi=44 indicating that Cu_{0.06}TiSe_{2} is an extreme type-II superconductor. Using these results together with the heat capacity then we find that n_{s} and m^{*}/m_{e} of 4.8\times 10^{26} m^{-3} and 7.5, respectively. For further details on these calculations see Ref. [20].

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of \sigma_{sc} for both ZFC and FC. As is clearly seen \sigma_{sc} for the ZFC and FC separates at 2.0 K. A similar effect [see Fig. 4 (inset)] is seen if the field is increased to 20 and 40 mT where the separation temperature is 1.0 and 0.5 K.

where f=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} which is the Fermi function. For both models, the temperature dependence of the gap was approximated by[23]

\[\Delta(T)=\Delta(0)\mathrm{tanh}\{1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T-1)]^{0.51}\}.\] (5)
