###### Abstract

The mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is still an open question. Although the relationship between microstructure and superconductivity has been noticed in the early days, there is still lack of a definite explanation. In this paper we study the microstructure and the superconductivity of La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples and La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.18}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples. It is surprising that the doping of Na\({}^{+}\) does not introduce itinerant hole carriers into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane. All La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples show insulatorlike behavior just like La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\). For La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.18}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples, they exhibit superconductivity even at Na doping content \(y\) = 0.30. We suggest that the microstructure directly dominates the carrier concentration in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane, so that it directly determines the occurrence of the superconductivity.

## I Introduction

La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) is the only copper-oxide superconductor for which the chemical composition can be varied over a wide enough range to obtain the full spectrum of electronic properties. The undoped compound La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) is an insulating antiferromagnet in which the spin moments on adjacent Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions are antiparallel. The bulk susceptibility of La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) shows the Neel like transition at 240 K, which indicates the long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order.[1] It is commonly accepted that upon doping of bivalent ions at La site the charge neutrality requires that the electrons are removed from the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes, thereby effectively creating mobile holes in the planes. With increasing hole concentration, the compound evolves from an AF insulator to a superconductor.[2] The influence of Sr\({}^{2+}\) doping on the carrier concentration of CuO\({}_{2}\) plane and on the conduction behavior of this system is of particular interest. It is crucial to clarify whether such behavior is intrinsic for these compounds or whether some simpler explanation, such as the effects of increasing carrier concentrations, a structural phase transition, or chemical phase separation, can explain the appearance of superconductivity.[3]

It is well known that upon doping La\({}^{3+}\) by divalent ions (such as Sr\({}^{2+}\) and Ba\({}^{2+}\)) in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) matrix, the charge carriers are introduced into the "parent" material. Electronic motion in these materials occurs primarily in the CuO\({}_{2}\) layers. In the cuprates the doped holes are believed to occupy oxygen 2_p\({}_{\sigma}\)_ orbitals which hybridize with the Cu 3_d\({}_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\)_ orbital to form a \(d^{9}\overline{L}\) (\(\overline{L}\) ligand hole) configuration.[4, 5] It is possible to vary the electron density in the square lattice by doping such a compound to La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), and then \(x\) measures the density of holes relative to the insulating state with one electron per site.[6, 7] Compared with the substitution of La\({}^{3+}\) by the 2+ ions, the substitution by monovalent ions, such as H\({}^{+}\), Li\({}^{+}\), Na\({}^{+}\), K\({}^{+}\), or Rb\({}^{+}\), should be more effective to provide holes which are crucial to the superconductivity. Besides the difference of valence, another difference between Na\({}^{+}\) and Sr\({}^{2+}\) lies on the ion radius. It is rather interesting to investigate the different behaviors of Na\({}^{+}\) doping and Sr\({}^{2+}\) doping in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system. In this paper we present the experiments on the microstructure, the superconductivity, and the transport properties of La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples and La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples. We suggest that in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\)-based superconductors, the compressive stress in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane is essential to the hybridization of the Cu 3_d\({}_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\)_ orbitals and the O 2_p\({}_{\sigma}\)_ orbitals, and this hybridization is essential to the introduction of hole carriers in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane. Thus the compressive stress in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\)-based superconductors is necessary for the superconductivity. This result gives a definite explanation on the microstructure and the superconductivity.

## II Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (\(y\) = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5) and La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (\(y\) = 0.02,0.05,0.1,0.15,0.3) were synthesized by means of a conventional solid-state reaction method using high-purity powders of La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), Na\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\), SrCO\({}_{3}\), and CuO. The mixed powders, pressed into pellets, were then reacted at 1100-1150 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 48 h under oxygen atmosphere. X-ray dif  fraction (XRD) analysis was carried out by a Rigaku-D/max-gA diffractometer using high-intensity Cu-_K_a_ radiation to screen for the presence of an impurity phase and the changes in structure. The lattice parameters were determined from the \(d\) value of XRD peaks by a standard least-squares refinement method. X-ray-photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using ESCALAB MK II spectrometer with Mg-_K_a_ x-ray source and a resolution of 0.9 eV. The measurements of infrared (IR) transmission spectra (Nicolet 700) were carried out at room temperature with powder samples in which KBr is used as a carrier. Resistivity was measured using a standard four-probe method in a closed-cycle helium cryostat between 16 K and room temperature. The Hall-effect measurements were performed by a dc method in fields of up to 4 T using a six-probe geometry. The thermoelectric power _S_(_T_) was measured by a differential method. The temperature of the samples was controlled automatically within the precision of 0.01 K, and the temperature gradient between both ends of the sample was 2 K. Magnetic susceptibility was measured by superconducting quantum interference device susceptometer (Quantum Design MPMS) under field cooled condition with 2 Oe.

## III. Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the x-ray-diffraction patterns of La2-3Na3CuO4 samples and La1.85-3Sr0.15Na3CuO4 samples. XRD analyses indicate that La2-3Na3CuO4 samples are crystallized in single-phase orthorhombic symmetry structure at room temperature and La1,85-3Sr0.15Na3CuO4 are crystallized in single-phase tetragonal symmetry structure. The index of diffraction peaks has been marked according to the JCPDS-International Center for Diffraction Data 1990, 40-1100. The impurities, such as La2O3, Na2O, CuO, do not appear in the system. The x-ray-diffraction result convinces that the synthesized samples are free from impurities and possess comparable quality as Na-free samples. The unit-cell parameters of La2-3Na3CuO4 samples and La1,85-3Sr0.15Na3CuO4 samples obtained by Rietveld analysis of the experimental XRD patterns are summarized in Tables 1 and 1, respectively. Clearly the lattice parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), the apical O-Cu bond length, the in-plane O-Cu bond length, and the in-plane Cu-O-Cu bond angle of these two series of samples show little change with increasing Na doping content. While in La2-3Sr0CuO4, previous studies have suggested that the \(c\) parameter expands slightly and the \(a\) and \(b\) parameters contract and finally lead to the stability of tetragonal structure above room temperature.3,8,9 We consider that this difference comes from the different ion radius of La3+ (1.17 A), Sr2+ (1.32 A), and Na+ (1.16 A). La2CuO4 has an intergrowth structure consisting of (LaO)2 rocksalt layers alternating with CuO2 sheets. The tolerance factor of the structure is

\[t = \frac{\text{La} - \text{O}}{\sqrt{2}\left( \text{Cu} - \text{O} \right)}.\]

In this case \(t\) < 1, the La-O bonds are in tension and the Cu-O bonds are in compression. In La2-3Sr2CuO4 system, the substitution of La3+ by larger ions Sr2+ increases the tolerance factor and introduces compressive stress into Cu-O bonds. In La2-3Na3CuO4 system, due to the similar ion ratio of La3+ (1.17 A) and Na+ (1.16 A), the dopant of Na+ does not introduce compressive stress into Cu-O sheet and does not straighten the Cu-O-Cu bond angle. Thus it remains orthorhombic structure at room temperature with increasing Na+ doping content and remains an unchanged Cu-O bond length.

In order to testify that the Na+ ions are introduced into the lattice, we carry out XPS measurements on these samples. As an example, in Fig. 1 we give the XPS results of La1,7Sr0.15Na0.15CuO4 sample. From Fig. 1 we notice that a peak located at 1071 eV which is corresponding to Na1s line. The atom proportions of all atoms concluded from the x-ray-

In order to explore further the doping effects of Na\({}^{+}\), the vibration modes of CuO\({}_{6}\) octahedron have been investigated by means of IR measurements because the vibration modes are effective to reflect the change of structure and other properties. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the infrared transmission spectra of La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples and La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples, respectively. For La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples, two infrared transmission peaks at \(\nu_{1}\) = 511.3 cm\({}^{-1}\) and \(\nu_{2}\) = 678.6 cm\({}^{-1}\) can be clearly observed within the frequency range of 350-800 cm\({}^{-1}\). With increasing Na\({}^{+}\) doping, \(\nu_{1}\) peak keeps steadily and \(\nu_{2}\) peak slightly shifts to high frequency. For La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples, only \(\nu_{1}\) = 503.7 cm\({}^{-1}\) peak can be observed within the frequency range of 350-800 cm\({}^{-1}\). We have carefully studied the infrared absorption spectra of La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system.[9] The \(\nu_{1}\) peak is assigned to the \(c\)-axis vibration mode and the \(\nu_{2}\) peak is assigned to the in-plane O-Cu stretching mode, and our previous report has suggested that the emergence of the \(\nu_{2}\) peak is always along with the metal-insulator transition in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\)-based compounds.[9] The infrared absorption lines exhibit little change with increasing Na\({}^{+}\) doping, which indicates that the doping of Na\({}^{+}\) has little effect on the structure and vibration state in these systems.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the temperature dependence of resistivity of La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples and La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples, respectively. It is obvious that all La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples exhibit semiconductorlike behavior and show no superconductivity at low temperatures. For La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples, it exhibits the superconductivity even at Na doping content \(y\) = 0.30. These results are quite surprising. According to the charge-transfer model, the substitution of monovalent Na\({}^{+}\) at the La\({}^{3+}\) site would introduce twice as many hole carriers into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane compared to the substitution of bivalent Sr\({}^{2+}\). Thus at a certain Na\({}^{+}\) doping content, the carrier concentration in La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) should be 2\(\,y\) per unit cell and the carrier concentration in La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) should be 0.15 + 2\(\,y\) per unit cell. Therefore, with increasing Na\({}^{+}\) doping, the La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) would exhibit the insulator-metal transition and superconductivity , and the superconductivity in the La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) would disappear as the system is driven to the overdoped regime.

In La\({}_{2-x-y}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) systems, Sr\({}^{2+}\) is at the valence of +2 while Na\({}^{+}\) is at the valence of +1. According to the charge transfer model, doping of monovalent Na\({}^{+}\) ions in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) would be easy to provide hole carriers into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane comparing to doping of bivalent Sr\({}^{2+}\) ions. However, our experimental results indicate the semiconducting conduction behavior of all La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples (0 \(\leq\)\(x\) \(\leq\) 0.5) and the superconductivity in all La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{y}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples (0 \(\leq\)\(x\) \(\leq\) 0.3). In Fig. 4(a) we

  show the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient for La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples. From Fig. 3(a) one can see that the carrier densities determined by Hall coefficient are very low in all La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples, and there is no obvious doping-dependent changes of either the magnitude or the shape of the Hall coefficient. The results of Hall coefficient indicate that the hole carriers are not introduced into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane by the Na doping in La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system. For the La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system, we give the temperature dependence of thermoelectric power for these samples, as shown in Fig. 4(b). One can see that there is no obvious change of either the magnitude or the shape of the thermoelectric power. These results also imply that doping of Na\({}^{+}\) does not introduce itinerant hole carriers into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane.

We also give the magnetic susceptibility for La\({}_{1.9}\)Na\({}_{0.1}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) sample as a function of temperature under field cooled condition with 2 Oe, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The bulk susceptibility on La\({}_{1.9}\)Na\({}_{0.1}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) shows the Neel-like transition at 240 K, which is quite similar to the result of undoped La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\). Thus we can conclude that the long-range AF order is not suppressed by Na doping in La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system. It gives direct evidence that it does not introduce itinerant hole carriers into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane by Na doping. Figure 5(b) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples. From Fig. 5(b) one can see the \(T_{c}\) value keeps at 37 K for all samples, which is in accordance with the resistivity measurements.

In the parent compound La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), there undergoes a cooperative tilting of the CuO\({}_{6}\) octahedron below an orthorhombic-tetragonal (OT) transition \(T_{t}\) due to the mismatch of the La-O and Cu-O equilibrium bond lengths, Fig. 6. Previous reports have revealed that the application of pressure on La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) contributes to the OT transition and to the increase of \(T_{c}\). [7, 10, 11, 12] In orthorhombic phase, \(T_{c}\) increases and the Cu-O-Cu bond straightens with pressure. In tetragonal phase, \(T_{c}\) is essentially pressure independent. In La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system the introduction of Sr\({}^{2+}\) has equivalent effects on the OT transition and the superconductivity because the substitution of La\({}^{3+}\) by larger ions Sr\({}^{2+}\) would introduce compressive stress into the Cu-O bond and stabilize the tetragonal structure. This compressive stress on the Cu-O sheet leads to a shortened Cu-O bond length [from 1.904 A (\(x\) = 0) to 1.886 A (\(x\) = 0.15) at room temperature]. However, in La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system, due to the similar ion radius of La\({}^{3+}\) and Na\({}^{+}\), it does not introduce compressive stress into the Cu-O bond and therefore does not undergo the OT transition with increasing Na doping content (the Cu-O bond length keeps constantly of 1.904 A). It is obvious that the doping of Na has little influence on the transport properties in the La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system. In La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples, doping of Na also has little influence on the structure (the Cu-O bond length keeps constant at 1.886 A) and the transport property. It means that the occurrence of superconductivity in La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples is due to the Sr\({}^{2+}\) doping but not to the Na\({}^{+}\) doping. Thus we conclude that in both systems, the doping of Na\({}^{+}\) does not introduce hole carriers into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane. We suggest that in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\)-based systems, the compressive stress is necessary for introduction of hole carriers into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane. With the doping of monovalent or divalent ions, there are holes introduced into the O site. However, if there is no compressive stress, the holes are located at the O site. With the in

  troduction of compressive stress, the Cu-O bond length in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane is shortened and the Cu \(3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) orbitals and the O \(2p_{\sigma}\) orbitals overlap is strengthened at a certain degree (the so-called hybridization). Due to this hybridization, the holes become itinerant and is shared by the Cu \(3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) orbitals and the O \(2p_{\sigma}\) orbitals. When there are itinerant hole carriers in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane, the system shows an insulator-metal transition. And at a certain degree of hybridization, the superconductivity occurs. Departure from this degree, the superconductivity weakens. In La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) the copper is in the \(+2\) valence state. The addition of Sr, Ba, and excess oxygen introduces the compressive stress which is in favor of the \(pd\,\sigma\) hybridization and forces some of the Cu ions into the \(+3\) valence state. The preservation of Cu\({}^{3+}\) is essential to the superconductivity. However, in La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{3}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) the addition of Na does not introduce the compressive stress and the Cu ions remain at the \(+2\) valence state. There may exist some oxygen vacancies. Thus the doping of Na does not contribute to the superconductivity.

We now consider why our results are important to the understanding of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity. They provide evidence that the compressive stress is essential to the introduction of hole carriers into the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane. The compressive stress induced by the doping of larger ion Sr\({}^{2+}\) makes the Cu-O-Cu bond angle changes from 173.1\({}^{\circ}\) to 180\({}^{\circ}\) of La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) and the itinerant charge carriers are introduced into the parent material. Although it is expected that Na\({}^{+}\) doping should be more effective, compared to Sr\({}^{2+}\) doping, to introduce hole carriers to the system, from Table I we notice that the doping of Na\({}^{+}\) does not change the Cu-O-Cu bond angle even at a doping content of \(y=0.3\). Thus it cannot provide hole carriers into the compound. These facts distinctly indicate that the superconductivity occurs at the Cu-O plane without distortion. With the decrease of Cu-O-Cu distortion, the overlap between the Cu \(3d_{x^{2}+y^{2}}\) orbitals and the O \(2P_{xy}\) orbitals strengthens, thus leads to a strength of the \(pd\sigma\) hybridization. When the \(pd\sigma\) hybridization is at a certain degree, the electrons can easily be transferred from an O \(2P_{xy}\) orbital to adjacent Cu \(3d_{x^{2}+y^{2}}\) orbital and the system exhibits metallic behavior. When the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane is not disturbed, it favors the superconductivity. Therefore, the above results indicate that the occurrence of the superconductivity is not only related to the carrier concentration in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane but also related to the degree of the hybridization between the Cu \(3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\) orbitals and the O \(2p_{\sigma}\) orbitals. Based on above discussion, we conclude that the dominance of microstructure on the superconductivity is intrinsical. The microstructure directly determines the carrier concentration in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, the microstructure, magnetic and transport properties of La\({}_{2-y}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples and La\({}_{1.85-y}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)Na\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) samples are studied. The experimental results indicate that doping of Na\({}^{+}\) has little influence on the superconductivity and transport properties in the La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) and La\({}_{1.85}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) systems. The results could not be explained by using the charge-transfer model. We suggest that the introduction of compressive stress in La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system is necessary for the superconductivity. Na\({}^{+}\) ions have similar radius as La\({}^{3+}\) ions. Thus it does not introduce compressive stress by Na\({}^{+}\) doping and thus doping of Na\({}^{+}\) has little influence on the microstructure and the superconductivity.
