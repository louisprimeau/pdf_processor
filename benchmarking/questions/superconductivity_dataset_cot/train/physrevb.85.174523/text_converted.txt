###### Abstract

We report experimental evidence for the connection between
superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in Rb0.8Fe2-ySe2-xTe_x single
crystals under negative chemical pressure introduced by the lattice
expansion of substituting Se with isovalent Te atoms. Electrical
resistance and magnetic measurements in the temperature range from 4 to
600 K demonstrate that both superconducting transition temperature
(_T_c) and the Neel temperature (_T_N) are suppressed continuously with
the lattice expansion. When the Te concentration x in Rb0.8Fe2-ySe2-xTe,
approaches 0.4, the superconductivity is completely suppressed, and the
sample behaves like a semiconductor; meanwhile, the features for
antiferromagnetic transition on resistance and magnetization curves
disappear. Our observation suggests that the effect of
negative-pressure-induced lattice expansion can be used to tune the
correlativity of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the studied
system.

REVIEW B **85**, 174523 (2012)

The discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO1-_x_Fx with _T_c as high
as 26 K [1] has attracted considerable attention in the communities of
condensed matter physics and material science. During the past four
years, several other types of iron-based superconductors with 122
structure (_M_Fe2As2, M = Ca, Sr, Ba, and Eu), [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] structure (_A_FeAs, A = Li and Na), [6, 7] 11
structure (FeSe), [8] and 42622 structure (Sr4V2O6Fe2As2) [9] were
found. Among them, the highest _T_c has reached as high as 55 K in
SmFeAsO1-_x_Fx. [10] Recently, another new family of superconductors
_M_x Fe2-ySe2 (_M_ = K, Rb, Cs, or Tl substituted K, Rb) with _T_c above
30 K and other unusual features was discovered, [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
which simulated great interest in the communities. The _M_x Fe2-ySe2
superconductors show a number of peculiar features, including
electron-dominated carriers in the Fermi surface, [16, 17, 18, 19]
high-transition temperature of antiferromagnetic phase, superstructure
of Fe vacancies, and large ordering magnetic moment for each iron atom.
[20, 21] Application of internal or external positive pressure on these
superconductors showed that the superconducting transition temperature
is suppressed with increasing pressure; [22, 23, 24] especially recent
investigations demonstrate that external physical pressure can tune the
_T_c down continuously until approaching a quantum critical point (QCP).
[22] Moreover, a reemerging superconductivity appears after the pressure
is above the QCP, [25] which enhances the mystery of these kinds of
superconductors. In this paper, we investigate the effect of negative
pressure introduced by substituting selenium (Se) with isovalent
tellurium (Te) in Rb0.8Fe2-ySe2. We found that superconductivity and the
Neel temperature are suppressed with Te doping. When the doping
concentration of Te approaches 0.4, the superconductivity vanishes;
meanwhile, its antiferromagnetic order almost disappears. This indicates
the existence of an interconnection between superconductivity and
antiferromagnetism in this material. By comparison with positive
pressure effect, we propose that a pressure-free sample (applied neither
positive nor negative pressure) possesses an optimal lattice and
electron structure configurations which are in favor of optimal
superconductivity.

Single crystals of Rb0.8Fe2-ySe2-xTe_x were grown by a self-flux method
with several steps. First, precursors of FeSe and FeTe were synthesized
by solid reaction method. High-purity Fe, Se, and Te powders were mixed
together with nominal composition of Fe : Se and Fe : Te in a mortar.
The mixture was put into a furnace and heated to 700 degC with a rate of
100 degC/hour, kept at this temperature for 24 h, and then cooled down
to room temperature naturally. Secondly, the precursors were mingled
with Rb in a glovebox and loaded into an alumina crucible, then sealed
in an evacuated silica ampoule. Thirdly, the sealed silica tube was
placed in a furnace, slowly heated to 1000 degC and kept at this
temperature for 5 h, afterward heated up to 1100 degC and kept for
another 5 h. Finally, the samples were cooled down to 800 degC with a
rate of 4 degC/hour, followed by shutting off the power of the furnace.

The resulting samples were characterized by x-ray diffractometer Rigaku
Ultima IV with Cu K_a_ radiation (_l_ = 1.5418 A) in the 2_th_ scan mode
[Fig. 1(a)]. Sharp (00l) peaks reflect that the sample orientates well
in the c direction. Powder x-ray diffraction was also carried out in the
same diffractometer [Fig. 1(b)]. The sample ground from the same batch
of the single crystal was measured by step scanning in the range from
10deg to 120deg in 2_th_ with sampling intervals of 0.02deg, and the
accumulation time was one minute for each degree. Rietveld refinements
of the data were performed using the fullprof package.

Electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements below 300
K were performed with a physical property measurement system (PPMS-9)
and a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID-XL1). As shown
in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), clear superconducting transitions at 31.4 K
determined by the resistance measurement and at 30.2 K detected by the
magnetic susceptibility measurement were observed, indicating a bulk
nature of superconductivity in Rb0.8Fe2-ySe2.

The actual chemical composition for all samples was characterized by
inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer, the resulting
composition of which is listed in the Table 1. It is seen that the
actual composition of the Te concentration in the studied sample is
quite close to that of its nominal composition.

To investigate how the tellurium substitution influences the lattice
distortion, we first performed powder x-ray diffraction measurements at
room temperature for Rb0.8Fe2-7Se2-7Tex (_x_ = 0-0.4) single crystals.
As shown in Fig. 2(a), all samples can be well indexed to be tetragonal
structure, demonstrating that no phase transition occurs in the
substitution range investigated. However, the lattice expansion is
clearly observed with increasing Te concentration [Fig. 2(b)], due to
the substitution of tellurium whose ionic radius is larger than Se. The
expansion in the c direction is about 1.3

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistance for
samples with different Te concentrations. We found that, with negative
pressure increasing (_x_ smaller than 0.25), superconducting transition
temperatures (_Tc_) of the samples are suppressed [Fig. 3(a)]. When the
Te doping approaches 0.3, it was noted that its resistance increases
with declining temperature, showing a semiconductor behavior

above the temperature of 30 K, while exhibiting a drop at ∼26 K.
Although no zero resistance was observed, we still applied a magnetic
field of 1 T to identify whether the resistance drop is related to a
superconducting transition. The result shows that the
resistance-temperature curve shifts to the lower temperature side under
the field, as displayed in Fig. 3(b), revealing that some isolating
superconducting phases may exist in the sample. In order to clarify the
intrinsic behavior for the sample with x = 0.3, we carried out
resistance measurements for four fresh samples from different batches
and found the same results. When Te concentration comes to 0.4, the
superconductivity is fully destroyed [Fig. 3(b)]. The suppression of
T_(c) with increasing Te concentration is also confirmed by dc
susceptibility measurements [inset of Fig. 3(b)]. The magnetic detection
shows that either superconducting transition temperature or volume
fraction of superconducting phase decreases with increasing negative
pressure. The sample of x = 0.4 is no longer diamagnetic, which is very
consistent with our resistance measurement.

To identify the effect of negative pressure on the long-range
antiferromagnetic orders and its relation to superconductivity of the
samples investigated, we measured electrical resistance from 300 to 600
K for Rb_(0.8)Fe_(2 − γ)Se_(2 − γ)Te_(x) single crystals. The resistance
and its derivative as a function of temperature were plotted in Figs.
3(c) and 3(d). We found two dips on the dR/dT curve; one is associated
with the formation of Fe-vacancy order (whose transition temperature is
defined as T_(S)), and the other is related to the antiferromagnetic
phase transition (whose transition temperature is defined as T_(N)), as
reported previously.[26] For the Te-free sample, its T_(S) and T_(N) are
about 556 and 510 K, respectively, which are slightly different from the
corresponding values reported in Ref. [26]. This may be due to the
subtle difference of sample’s composition. Both T_(S) and T_(N) decrease
with increasing Te concentration, indicating that the lattice expansion
is in favor of suppressing the formation of Fe vacancies as well as the
transition temperature of paramagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic phase.
Importantly, we found that T_(N) vanishes from the dR/dT curve at
x = 0.4, where the sample completely loses its superconductivity. The
synchronic suppression (x < 0.3) and disappearance (x = 0.4) of T_(N)
and T_(c) suggest the existence of a link between superconductivity and
antiferromagnetism.

The response of superconductivity to negative pressure in Te-doped
Rb_(0.8)Fe_(2 − γ)Se_(2 − γ)Te_(x) is similar to that of positive
pressure in S-doped K_(x)Fe_(2 − γ)Se₂ or compressed
K_(0.8)Fe_(1.7)Se₂.[22, 23, 24] Figure 4 displays

The squares in (b) represent the T_(c) determined by resistance
measurements, and the circles represent the T_(c) determined by dc
susceptibility measurements. Here, the T_(c) (square) is defined by the
temperature where the resistance equals to zero, and the Tc (circle) is
defined by the temperature where the sample is diamagnetic.

concentration. (b) Magnetization as a function of temperature for the

T_(c) and of volume for the S-doped and Te-doped samples. We found that
either positive pressure or negative pressure can suppress
superconductivity, but a pressure-free sample possesses an optimal
superconductivity.

To further investigate negative pressure effect on T_(N), we performed
high-temperature magnetic measurements for all samples (Fig. 5). We
found the same phenomenon, i.e. the T_(N) is suppressed with increasing
Te concentration. Through careful inspection on temperature dependence
of magnetization for each sample investigated, we found that the
intensity of the antiferromagnetic transition of the studied samples is
doping dependent. When the doping level reaches 0.4, the sample loses
its magnetic order, which is in good agreement with our resistive
detection. We summarized phase diagrams of negative pressure dependence
of T_(c) and T_(N) in Fig. 6. It is obvious that both T_(c) and T_(N)
decrease with increasing Te concentration. When the superconductivity
completely vanishes in the sample of x = 0.4, its antiferromagnetic
order disappears simultaneously. For the sake of further illuminating
the effect of Te doping on T_(N), we also plotted dM/dT as a function of
Te doping (negative pressure) in the inset of Fig. 6 and found that
dM/dT decreases with an enhancement of Te concentration. The results are
reproducible in three independent runs with new samples. Our data
indicate that once the antiferromagnetic ordering is constructed, the
superconducting phase emerges at low temperature, suggesting an
interconnection between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism.
Recently, μsR, Mossbauer, neutron scattering, and Raman experiments also
showed that the superconductivity in M_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ coexists with
the antiferromagnetic long-range order.[20, 26, 27, 28, 29] The reported
experimental finding in this study on correlation between
superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in
Rb_(0.8)Fe_(2 − y)Se_(2 − x)Te_(x) single crystals should be important
and informative for underlying superconducting mechanisms of this
unusual new type of superconductors.

In summary, we show that the partial substitution of tellurium for
selenium can create negative pressure, which leads to the lattice
expansion. Resistance and magnetization measurements suggest that
superconductivity and antiferromagnetism of
Rb_(0.8)Fe_(2 − y)Se_(2 − x)Te_(x) single crystals are doping dependent,
i.e. both of T_(c) and T_(N) are suppressed with increasing Te
concentration or increasing negative pressure. At x = 0.4, the
superconductivity is completely destroyed, and the antiferromagnetic
order almost disappears simultaneously. This suggests that the
superconductivity in Rb_(0.8)Fe_(2 − y)Se_(2 − x)Te_(x) is correlated to
its antiferromagnetism. Summarizing the effects of positive and negative
pressures on the M_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ superconductors, we propose that
application of any kind of pressure is not in favor of their
superconductivity.
