###### Abstract

The layered, noncentrosymmetric heavy element PbTaSe₂ is found to be
superconducting. We report its electronic properties accompanied by
electronic-structure calculations. Specific heat, electrical
resistivity, and magnetic-susceptibility measurements indicate that
PbTaSe₂ is a moderately coupled, type-II BCS superconductor
(T_(c) = 3.72 K, Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ = 17) with an
electron-phonon coupling constant of λ_(ep) = 0.74. Electronic-structure
calculations reveal a single bulk three-dimensional Dirac cone at the K
point of the Brillouin zone derived exclusively from its hexagonal Pb
layer; it is similar to the feature found in graphene except there is a
0.8 eV gap opened by spin-orbit coupling. The combination of large
spin-orbit coupling and lack of inversion symmetry also results in large
Rashba splitting on the order of tenths of an eV.

Noncentrosymmetric superconductors have been known for decades but have
become a prominent research topic recently with the discovery of the
heavy-fermion superconductor CePt₃Si [1]. Noncentrosymmetric systems can
exhibit asymmetric spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in superconducting
materials, which leads to the breaking of spin degeneracy and a
parity-mixed superconducting state [2]. The symmetry of the Cooper pairs
is therefore nontrivially affected by the strength of the SOC, which is
governed by the crystal structure as well as the elemental composition
[3,4]. Superconductors that lack inversion symmetry can be divided into
two types: strongly correlated systems such as CePt₃Si [1] and UIr [5],
and weakly correlated systems such as Li₂M₃B (M= Pd, Pt) [6,7] and
Mg₁₀Ir₁₉B₁₆[8]. In the strongly correlated materials, the
superconducting properties are heavily influenced by the electron
correlations making the weakly correlated materials more fertile ground
for studying the effects derived from the breaking of inversion symmetry
and the asymmetric spin-orbit-coupling interaction. Materials with
strong SOC are also of interest as exotic spin systems [9] and
topological insulators [10,11] (TIs), and relativistic Dirac electrons
in condensed-matter systems are of interest on the surface of TIs, in
graphene and other monatomic hexagonal lattices [12, 13, 14, 15], and
also in the bulk of three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetals (e.g.,
Cd₃As₂, Na₃Bi, and Pb_(1 − x)Sn_(x)Se [16, 17, 18, 19]). Recent
theoretical work has predicted SOC gapping in Dirac cones at the K point
in crystallographic phases similar to, but heavier than, graphene [20].
Here we show that the hexagonal, noncentrosymmetric compound PbTaSe₂
exhibits strong SOC, superconducts below 3.72 K and has a gapped
graphene-like Dirac cone at K in its electronic structure that is
derived exclusively from its hexagonal Pb layer.

PbTaSe₂ displays alternating stacking of hexagonal TaSe₂ and Pb layers
[21]. The crystal structure is highly noncentrosymmetric as can be seen
by inspecting the Ta positions in the inset of Fig. 1(a). High-quality
polycrystalline samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction at 800
^(∘)C for one week using prereacted PbSe, TaSe₂, and elemental Ta powder
in sealed quartz tubes in a PbSe atmosphere. The samples were determined
to be pure by powder x-ray diffraction. Due to the polycrystalline
nature of the samples, the measured superconductivity parameters are
averaged over all crystallographic directions.

The superconducting transition was examined through
temperature-dependence measurements of the electrical resistivity ρ(T)
and dc magnetic susceptibility using a Quantum Design physical property
measurement system (PPMS). The whole temperature range of ρ(T) is shown
in Fig. 1(a). The normal-state resistivity for PbTaSe₂ reveals a
metallic-like character (dρ/dT > 0), with the residual resistivity ratio
RRR ≈d. The superconducting transition is seen just below 3.8 K. Figure
1(b) shows the superconducting transition characterized by dc magnetic
susceptibility. The much smaller field-cooling (FC) signal compared with
the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) signal is caused by pinning of the
vortices. The estimated superconducting critical temperature, as
determined by the midpoints of the transitions, is 3.7 K, in agreement
with resistivity measurements. The diamagnetic response, normalized by a
demagnetization factor, is very close to the expected value. Figure 1(c)
shows the low-temperature resistivity ρ(T) under zero field and applied
magnetic fields up to 0.5 T. A very sharp superconducting transition is
observed for 0 T, with the superconducting critical temperature
T_(c) = 3.79 K and transition width ΔT_(c) = 0.15 K. Knowing the values
of T_(c) for different magnetic fields, we plot the upper critical field
values, μ₀H_(c2) vs temperature in Fig. 1(d). The upward curvature of
the upper critical field line may be due to an intrinsically anomalous
pairing mechanism. The previously proposed formula
[22]H_(c2)(T) = H_(c2)(0)(1 − t^(3/2))^(3/2), where $t=\frac{T}{T_{c}}$
was used to fit the whole H_(c2)(T) data set and gives an excellent fit
(R² = 0.999 96) with μ₀H_(c2)(0) = 1.47 T [Fig. 1(d), solid blue line].
This model has been used to fit H_(c2)(T) for noncentrosymmetric
Nb_(0.18)Re_(0.82)[23] and the borocarbide superconductors [24].
Alternatively, the orbital critical field, for a single-band, BCS-type
superconductor, is given by
$H_{c2}(T)=-AT_{c}\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}|_{(T=T_{c})}$ where A is either
0.69 or 0.73, for the dirty or clean limits, respectively [25]. From
Fig. 1(d), the slope d H_(c2)/dT = −0.46 T/K was determined for the
temperature range 2.3 K  < T< 3 K (dashed red line) and, taking
T_(c) = 3.72 K, the orbital upper critical field was estimated as
μ₀H_(c2) = 1.18 T or 1.25 T for the dirty or clean limit, respectively,
both of which are close to that obtained by the more detailed fitting
procedure. For further calculations we employ μ₀H_(c2)(0) = 1.47 T. With
this information, the coherence length can be calculated by using the
Ginzburg-Landau formula ξ_(GL)(0) = {ϕ₀/[2π H_(c2)(0)]}^(1/2), where
ϕ₀ = h/2e and is found to be ξ_(GL)(0) = 15 nm.

Assuming that the initial linear response to field is perfectly
diamagnetic [Fig. 2(a)], i.e., dM/dH is $-\frac{1}{4\pi}$, we obtain a
demagnetization factor that is consistent with the sample shape and its
orientation in the magnetic field. Figure 2(a) shows the magnetization
(M) as a function of applied field (H) and Fig. 2(b) presents the
difference between magnetization measured at 2 K and the $M_{\rm fit}$
[shown as a red solid line in Fig. 2(a)] fit in the low-H range where
the linear M(H) is observed. As shown in Fig. 2(b), M(H) starts to
deviate from $M_{\rm fit}$ at a field H_(c)^(*) of about 53 Oe, giving a
lower critical field, taking into account the demagnetization factor, of
H_(c1)(2K) = H_(c)^(*)/(1 − d) = 60 Oe. The estimation of μ₀H_(c1)(0)
has been done by fitting experimental data to the formula
H_(c1)(T) = H_(c1)(0)[1 − (T/T_(c))²], which is represented by the red
solid line in Fig. 2(c). The estimated zero-temperature lower critical
field μ₀H_(c1)(0) = 7.5 mT implies a Ginzburg-Landau superconducting
perturbation method calculated using

$$\mu_{0}H_{c1}=\frac{\Phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda_{GL}^{2}}\ln\frac{\lambda_{GL}}{\xi _{GL}}$$

of approximately λ_(GL) = 248 nm. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter
[κ = λ_(GL)(0)/ξ_(GL)(0)] is κ = 17, indicating that PbTaSe₂ is a
type-II superconductor. Using these parameters and the relation
H_(c1)H_(c2) = H_(c1)²ln (κ), we estimated the thermodynamic critical
field μ₀H_(c) = 57.4 mT.

The heat capacity was measured using a relaxation calorimeter (Quantum
Design PPMS). Figure 3(a) illustrates

linear M(H) is observed. (b) The difference between magnetization
measured at 2 K and the $M_{\rm fit}$: the difference $M(H)-M_{\rm fit}$

the overall temperature dependence of the specific heat C_(p). At room
temperature, C_(p) is close to the expected Dulong-Petit value
(3nR ≈ 100 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹), where n is the number of atoms per formula unit
(n = 4), and R is the gas constant (R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹). Figure 3(b)
shows C_(p)/T versus T² in the low-temperature range measured under a
magnetic field of μ₀H = 5 T, which exceeds the upper critical field for
PbTaSe₂. The experimental data points were fit in the temperature range
of 1.9 K to 3.7 K by using the formula C_(p) = γT + Bγ². The fit yields
the electronic specific-heat coefficient (Sommerfeld coefficient)
γ = 6.9 (2) mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻², and phonon specific-heat coefficient
β = 2.67 (0.03) mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻⁴. Bulk superconductivity is confirmed by a
large anomaly [Fig. 3(c)] at a T_(c) = 3.72 K as determined by the
entropy-balance method. This is consistent with T_(c) determined by the
dc magnetic-susceptibility and resistivity measurements. Using γ and the
specific-heat-jump value ΔC/T_(c) at the superconducting transition
temperature, ΔC/γT_(c) can be calculated and is found to be 1.41, which
is very close to the BCS value of 1.426.

In a simple Debye model, the β coefficient is related to the Debye
temperature (Θ_(D)) through
$\Theta_{D}=(\frac{12\pi^{+}}{5\beta}nR)^{1}$, and the estimated Debye
temperature for PbTaSe₂ is only 143 K, which reflects the fact that it
contains heavy elements. As can be seen from Fig. 3(a), $C_{\rm Debye}$
with Θ_(D) = 143 K (dotted blue line) is not large enough to reach the
experimental heat-capacity values above 40 K. Therefore we fit the data
in the temperature range 10 to 300 K by using the formula
$C_{p}=\gamma\,T+kC_{\rm Debye}(T)+(1-k)C_{\rm Einstein}(T)$, in which
higher-energy optical modes are considered. The first term (γ T) is the
electronic contribution and the k parameter corresponds to the weight of
the phonon contributions to the specific heat given by the Debye
($C_{\rm Debye}$) and Einstein ($C_{\rm Einstein}$) models,
respectively:

$$C_{\rm Debye}(T) = 9n\,R\left(\frac{T}{\Theta_{D}}\right)^{3}\int\frac{x^{4}\exp(x) }{[\exp(x-1)]^{2}},$$
$$C_{\rm Einstein}(T) = 3n\,R\left(\frac{\Theta_{E}}{T}\right)^{2}\exp\left(\frac{\Theta _{E}}{T}\right)\left[\exp\left(\frac{\Theta_{E}}{T}-1\right)\right]^{-2}.$$

Θ_(D) and Θ_(E) are the Debye and Einstein temperatures, respectively.
The fit represented by the solid, red line in Fig. 3(a) gives 41

With these results and assuming μ^(*) = 0.13, the electron-phonon
coupling constant λ_(ep) can be calculated from the inverted McMillans
formula [26]

$$\lambda_{ep}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln\left(\frac{\Theta_{D}}{1.45\lambda_{T}} \right)}{(1-0.62)\mu^{*}\ln\left(\frac{\Theta_{D}}{1.45\lambda_{T}}\right)-1.04}$$

and is found to be 0.74. This value is similar to that found in other
moderately coupled superconductors such as YPd₂Sn and HfPd₂Al [27].
Having the Sommerfeld parameter and the electron-phonon coupling, the
noninteracting density of states at the Fermi energy can be calculated
from

$$N(E_{F})=\frac{3\gamma}{\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}(1+\lambda_{ep})}.$$

The value obtained for PbTaSe₂, N(E_(F)) = 1.7 states eV⁻¹ per formula
unit, agrees well with the 1.5 states eV⁻¹ per formula unit calculated
from theoretical predictions (see below). Table 1 compares the measured
and derived superconductivity parameters of PbTaSe₂ with other
noncentrosymmetric superconductors: Mg₁₀Ir₁₉B₁₆ and Nb_(0.18)Ra_(0.82).

Electronic-structure calculations were performed in the framework of
density functional theory using the wien2k code [28] with a
full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave and local orbitals basis
together with the Perdew-Ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized
gradient

approximation [29, 30]. In order to check the robustness of the
electronic-structure calculations, they were also performed using the
Trans-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) functional [31], which resulted
in no significant differences.

Band structure calculations for PbTaSe₂ immediately unveil a single bulk
3D Dirac cone at the K point in the Brillouin zone that is gapped by
large SOC [Fig. 4(a)]. The Dirac cone at K in graphene is also gapped by
SOC, albeit by only a few mK; in PbTaSe₂, the strong SOC gaps the cone
by about 0.8 eV. This single Dirac cone that is gapped by SOC is highly
suggestive of PbTaSe₂ being topologically nontrivial, as this motif is
observed in both graphene [32] (which is a quantum spin Hall insulator)
and Bi₁₄Rh₁[33] (which is predicted to be a weak topological insulator).
Also, 3D Dirac cones have recently been observed in the two semimetals
Cd₃As₂ and Na₃Bi which, if gapped, would drive the systems into the
topological insulator regime. Furthermore, the four states that were
degenerate at the Dirac point without SOC, when SOC is included, now
have different eigenvalues under S6 (C6-bar), C3, and mirror operations.
The existence of these symmetries at points where there are possible
band inversions suggests the possibility of topological surface states
protected by crystalline symmetry, as is seen in topological crystalline
insulators [34, 35, 36]. Furthermore, although PbTaSe₂ is a metal, there
is a continuous gap formed around E_(F) when SOC is considered. A closer
look at the electronic structure in Fig. 4(a) reveals two band crossings
along A-L and A-H (that are not present along Γ-M or Γ-K, demonstrating
that the coupling in the z direction is important) that become gapped
with the inclusion of SOC.

The combination of large SOC and broken inversion symmetry is also
apparent in the large spin splitting observed in the electronic
structure. This is most readily observed around the H point in Fig.
4(a). This spin splitting is on a similar magnitude (in the tenths of
eVs) as in the giant Rashba semiconductor BiTeI [37]. In fact,
Rashba-type spin splitting is observed around the M and L points around
the continuous gap shown in Fig. 4(a). Finally, Fig. 4(b) shows the
electronic structure of the Pb sublattice alone. This demonstrates that
the Dirac cone observed at K is uniquely due to the Pb sublattice and,
with SOC considered, becomes gapped as well. In fact, the Pb sublattice
goes from being metallic to being almost completely gapped with the
inclusion of SOC. The electronic structure therefore shows that some of
the charge carriers in PbTaSe₂ are massive 3D Dirac electrons. If the
apparent band inversion of the 3D massive Dirac electrons [38] gives
rise to a topological crystalline insulator-like state as in
Pb_(0.77)Sn_(0.23)Se [34], then a cleaved 001 surface of PbTaSe₂ may
host Majorana zero modes at the surface even if the bulk superconducting
gap is nontrivial, due to the fact that the 001 surface maintains the
mirror and C3 symmetries [39]. Furthermore, the large spin splitting
observed in the electronic structure indicates the likelihood of an
unconventional pairing mechanism that could lead to a nontrivial
superconducting gap–another possible way of supporting Majorana fermions
at a cleaved surface of PbTaSe₂.

In conclusion, we report the discovery of superconductivity in PbTaSe₂
and its unusual electronic structure. The single-layer Pb sublattice in
PbTaSe₂ behaves similarly to graphene monolayers in that it also
generates a Dirac point at K, generating 3D massive Dirac fermions by
large SOC. Unlike graphene superlattices, however, the inclusion of Pb
layers in a natural superlattice with TaSe₂ does not affect the in-plane
orbitals of Pb that make the Dirac cone at K. This represents a unique
case where a two-dimensional (2D) elemental sublattice capable of
generating 2D massive Dirac fermions can be interfaced with a transition
metal dichalcogenide to create a superconducting superlattice,
generating 3D massive Dirac fermions and broken inversion symmetry, all
in a thermodynamically stable material. In addition to PbTaSe₂ (T_(c) =
3.72 K) and InTaS₂ (T_(c)≈ 1.0 K [40]), layered materials of this type
[21, 41] may represent a new family of materials where the interplay of
noncentrosymmetric superconductivity and large SOC can lead to
nontrivial electronic topologies.
