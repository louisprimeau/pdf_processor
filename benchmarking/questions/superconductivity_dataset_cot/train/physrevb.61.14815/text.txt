###### Abstract

We report measurements of the thermopower and resistivity of two superconducting Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)BiO\({}_{3}\) single crystals with \(x\)\(\sim\) 0.4 (close to optimal doping), and analyze these data together with earlier data for K concentrations that span the accessible metallic and superconducting phase 0.37\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)0.55. The thermopower \(S\) for temperatures below 120 K exhibits similar behavior to that seen for the cuprates close to optimal doping: the thermopower is positive for temperatures just above \(T_{c}\) but decreases with increasing temperature. A change of slope appears in the thermopower data at \(T\)\(\sim\)120-150 K, with an increase in \(dS/dT\) above this temperature. We show that all the data can be accounted for by a two-band model similar to that used by Hashimoto _et al._ to explain the thermopower of the related superconductor, BaPb\({}_{0.75}\)Bi\({}_{0.25}\)O\({}_{3}\), and are consistent with the reported persistence of the charge-density-wave gap in the superconducting phase near the metal-semiconductor transition.

## I Introduction

The bismuthate superconductor, Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)BiO\({}_{3}\) (BKBO),[1, 2] is often classed as a high-temperature superconductor, since its superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{c}\)\(\sim\) 30 K) is well above that of pre-1986 superconductors. BKBO is of considerable interest since it has several similarities to the cuprate superconductors apart from high \(T_{c}\) values: it is an oxide with a perovskite structure involving a low carrier density and in which superconductivity is observed near a metal-insulator transition.

Despite such similarities, there are also marked differences. In contrast to the planar structure of the cuprates, the superconducting phase of BKBO has a three-dimensional cubic structure.[3] The undoped parent compound for BKBO (BaBiO\({}_{3}\)) contains no magnetic ions but instead consists of an insulating charge-density-wave (CDW) phase.[4, 5] As potassium is substituted onto the Ba site, a metallic superconducting phase is formed for 0.37\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)0.55. Another difference is that various evidence suggests that a more conventional BCS-type picture involving electron-phonon coupling is responsible for superconductivity in BKBO.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] Given such similarities and differences, the study of BKBO is very worthwhile since a comparison with the cuprates may provide clues regarding mechanisms for high \(T_{c}\). An understanding of the normal state formed above \(T_{c}\) is important for understanding the nature of the superconducting state. In particular, it is useful to study the normal state electronic transport properties of these materials in order to determine characteristics of the normal state carriers.

When BKBO crystals are optimally doped, their resistivity tends to vary approximately linearly with temperature, but with overdoping the resistivity above \(T_{c}\) takes on a higher power-law behavior.[12] A similar behavior is seen in cuprate superconductors.[13] (We note that single crystals or melt-processed[14] BKBO are needed to observe the intrinsic metallic resistivity behavior, since the resistivity of ceramic BKBO samples[15, 16, 17] appears to be dominated by grain boundaries and disorder.)

Regarding thermoelectric power, the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates show remarkably systematic behavior.[18, 19] The in-plane thermopower, \(S\), is positive just above \(T_{c}\) and then decreases approximately linearly with increasing temperature. As the hole carrier concentration is increased, the thermopower shifts to smaller values while still maintaining approximately the same slope as a function of temperature. In the overdoped limit, the cuprate thermopower is similar to that expected for the diffusion thermopower of a conventional metal in which the carriers are electrons, \(S\)\(\propto\) \(-\)\(T\).

For BKBO, there appears to be only one set of previous thermopower data on single crystals.[20, 21, 22] These data, measured on crystals grown by Tang,[23] reveal a surprising similarity in the temperature range above \(T_{c}\) to the pattern of temperature dependence seen in the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates. The main difference between the BKBO and cuprate thermopower data is that a knee appears in the BKBO data at a temperature \(T\)\(\sim\)150 K with an upturn above this temperature. Previous measurements of BKBO thermopower on ceramic samples[15, 16, 17] show somewhat varying behavior, but a change of slope as a function of temperature is also seen in these samples.

In this paper, we investigate further this intriguing behavior of the BKBO thermopower for the superconducting phase. We first report thermopower and resistivity measurements on two new BKBO crystals that provide independent confirmation of the behavior found for the one previous set of crystals measured.[20, 21, 22] We then analyze these data together with the earlier data set and show that a two-band model accounts very well for all the available data on Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)BiO\({}_{3}\) in the accessible metallic phase 0.37\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)0.55 (superconductivity is also observed at low temperatures in this range).

## II Experimental data

Two Ba\({}_{0.6}\)K\({}_{0.4}\)BiO\({}_{3}\) single crystals were prepared using electrochemical synthesis. The starting materials, KOH, Ba(OH)\({}_{2}\)8H\({}_{2}\)O and Bi\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), were heated in a teflon crucible at 280 \({}^{\circ}\)C. In order to grow single crystals electrochemically, platinum and gold wires were used for the anode and cathode, respectively. The applied current was typically \(\sim\) 4 mA and the crystal growth was performed at 280 \({}^{\circ}\)C in air without stirring. A typical time for the electrochemical deposition was 22 h. One of the crystals (labeled as **c**) was prepared six months before the other (crystal **b**). The size of the crystals was approximately 3.6 mm\(\times\)2.4 mm\(\times\)2.0 mm. For resistivity measurements, the standard four-probe method was used with silver wires attached to the samples using silver paste. For the thermopower measurements a standard differential thermocouple technique was used. The small size of the crystals and the very small magnitude of the measured thermopower means that measurement uncertainties are relatively large in relation to the thermopower magnitude.

We present our measurements for the new crystals **b** and **c** in Fig. 1 (resistivity) and in Fig. 2 (thermopower) together with earlier data from Subramaniam _et al._[20] and Liu _et al._[21] The inset in Fig. 1 illustrates the decrease in \(T_{c}\) as the current increases. From the sharp low-current resistivity transition we estimate \(T_{c}\) \(\approx\) 29 K for crystal **b** and \(T_{c}\) = 27 K for crystal **c**, confirming that the crystals are near optimal doping.[3]

The resistivity and \(T_{c}\) value for our new crystal **b** are similar to those of crystal **a** for which the K concentration was measured to be \(x\)\(\sim\)\(0.38\) (corresponding to optimal doping),[20] but there is a tendency to a \(T^{2}\) behavior in the resistivity just above \(T_{c}\) for our crystal **b**. The resistivity temperature dependence of our crystal **c** is similar to that of crystal **b** but the magnitude of the resistivity is lower; a rather variable magnitude of resistivity for BKBO crystals near optimal doping was also found in the earlier data set.[20] The earlier data for overdoped crystals **d** and **e** show depressed \(T_{c}\) values and a more pronounced nonlinear behavior in resistivity.[21]

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the resistivity of all the BKBO crystals has a temperature dependence of metallic character, with no clear evidence of any contribution to temperature dependence from semiconductorlike conduction as typically seen in ceramic samples.[15, 16, 17] However, the magnitude of the resistivity is extremely high for a metallic system, indicating a small density of carriers as might be expected near a metal-insulator transition. The extrapolated residual resistivity is also a large fraction of the total resistivity at room temperature (approximately 0.3, or higher for crystal **a**), which suggests a large amount of disorder scattering is present. This presence of strong elastic scattering of carriers due to disorder may play a role in reducing the power of the temperature dependence due to scattering by phonons below the \(T^{5}\) behavior seen in good metals with small elastic scattering, or the lower power behavior may arise from electron-electron scattering in a Fermi liquid.[24] We further discuss resistivity below after analyzing the thermopower data.

Our new thermopower data for crystals **b** and **c** in Fig. 2 confirm the key features of the earlier data set, namely a decrease in thermopower above \(T_{c}\) and an increase in \(dS\)/\(dT\) in the temperature range 120\(-\)150 K. The general consistency of the behavior for the different samples shown in Fig. 2 gives confidence that these basic features are in fact characteristic of BKBO thermopower behavior.

These data resemble the thermopower behavior seen for the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates close to optimal doping. For temperatures just above \(T_{c}\) the thermopower is positive but then

Samples **b** and **c** are our new crystals (\(x\)\(\sim\)\(0.4\)), **a** is an optimally doped crystal (\(x\)\(\sim\)\(0.38\)) measured by Subramaniam _et al._, (Ref. [20]), and **d** and **e** are overdoped crystals (\(x\)\(\sim\)\(0.5\) and \(x\)\(\sim\)\(0.55\), respectively) measured by Liu _et al._ (Ref. [21]). The solid curves show fits of the generalized Bloch-Gruneisen function, Eq. (3). Dashed curves show the effects of including the hole band and the nonlinearity in energy-dependent conductivity for the same parameters as in the fit to Eq. (3); these shapes rescaled to fit the data are also shown by full curves but are essentially indistinguishable from the fit to Eq. (3). The inset shows the effect of current on \(T_{c}\) for crystal **c**; the labels indicate current in mA, with 1 mA corresponding to a current density of approximately 40 mA/cm\({}^{2}\).

  decreases with increasing temperature. For \(T\)\(\approx\)\(\,\)120 K, the slope \(dS/dT\)\(\sim\,\)\(-\,\)0.005 to \(-\,\)0.01 \(\mu\)V K\({}^{-2}\) has a much smaller magnitude than that seen for the cuprates.[18] The thermopower magnitude is also smaller than in the cuprates or in the related superconductor BaPb\({}_{0.73}\)Bi\({}_{0.25}\)O\({}_{3}\),[25] and very small even compared to good metallic systems. Another difference from the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates is that the increase in \(dS/dT\) above \(T\)\(\sim\)\(\,\)120-150 K that we and previous workers observe in BKBO is typically not seen in the cuprates.

Given that the thermopower is increasing with decreasing temperature for optimally doped BKBO crystals, the normal-state thermopower must have a positive peak at low temperatures. This peak is suppressed below \(T_{c}\) by the presence of superconducting pairs but we surmise that it exists since the thermopower must tend to zero in the zero-temperature limit. As the hole carrier concentration is increased, the positive peak becomes reduced until, in the overdoped regime, the peak is completely lost. The remaining negative linear thermopower, \(S\)\(\propto\,\)\(-\,\)\(T\), below 150 K is then typical of the diffusion thermopower expected in a conventional metallic system and very similar to the behavior of overdoped cuprates mentioned in the Introduction. The fact that the thermopower of our crystal **c** becomes negative at higher temperatures suggests that it is slightly overdoped compared to crystals **a** and **b**, in agreement with its slightly lower \(T_{c}\) value and smaller resistivity.

Unlike the cuprates, BKBO cannot be significantly underdoped to show a lower \(T_{c}\) while retaining itinerant carriers. Instead, at low temperatures BKBO shows a transition to a semiconducting orthorhombic phase as the K concentration \(x\) decreases below 0.37.[3] The upper limit on \(x\) is set by the difficulty of synthesizing crystals with \(x\)\(>\)0.5.[3, 12] Thus the data in Fig. 2 that we analyze span the accessible metallic superconducting phase 0.37\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)0.55 for BKBO.

## III Two-band model

We now consider an explanation for the thermopower behavior shown in Fig. 2. In view of the evidence for the conventional electron-phonon interaction as the origin of the superconductivity, we focus on conventional explanations. Given that the simple linear negative thermopower in the overdoped regime can be understood in terms of conventional metallic diffusion thermopower, there remain to be explained two main features of the thermopower data. One is the increasing positive thermopower peak as samples are progressively doped away from the overdoped regime, and the other is the knee occurring at \(T\)\(\sim\)120\(-\)150 K.

It was pointed out earlier[20] that the relative similarity between thermopower in ceramic BKBO samples to that in crystals argues against phonon drag as the cause of the low-temperature thermopower peaks. This is because the increased disorder in the ceramics, demonstrated by their non-metallic resistivity behavior, would be expected to suppress phonon drag and therefore lead to a greater difference in thermopower behavior if phonon drag were a major factor in the crystals. The large residual scattering in all the crystal samples would also be expected to decrease phonon drag even in the crystals.

We therefore consider instead, an explanation in terms of electronlike and holelike contributions to the diffusion thermopower, following the general approach used by Hashimoto _et al.[25]_ to account for thermopower in the closely related bismuthate superconductor BaPb\({}_{0.75}\)Bi\({}_{0.25}\)O\({}_{3}\). We infer from the extremely small thermopower of all Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)BiO\({}_{3}\) samples in the concentration range for which superconductivity occurs that the Fermi surface is not strongly holelike or electronlike. This is particularly the case since, according to the Mott formula, free-electron-like metals with low carrier density are expected to have a large thermopower. The evolution of the thermopower near room temperature from positive with positive slope for some optimally doped samples, to negative with negative slope for overdoped samples, may reflect the evolution of part of the Fermi surface from slightly holelike to electronlike as K is substituted for Ba. Such a picture appears to be consistent with the band-structure calculations of Mattheiss and Hamann[4] for ordered Ba\({}_{0.5}\)K\({}_{0.5}\)BiO\({}_{3}\), where the Fermi level appears near the middle of the upper Bi(\(\delta s\))-O(\(2p\)) band: substitution of monovalent K for divalent Ba could lower the Fermi level slightly and lead to more electronlike behavior.

In the parent compound, BaBiO\({}_{3}\), a commensurate charge-density-wave distortion opens up a semiconductor gap, explaining its semiconducting properties,[4] and this gap persists until \(x\)\(\sim\)0.37 where the superconducting regime begins. Observations of x-ray superlattice reflections by Du _et al.[26]_ indicate the presence of a charge-density wave, caused by the ordered disproportionation between non-equivalent Bi\({}^{3+}\) and Bi\({}^{5+}\) ions, even for the superconducting composition \(x\)\(\sim\)0.4 in Ba\({}_{1-x}\)K\({}_{x}\)BiO\({}_{3}\). We, therefore, consider a contribution from a semiconductorlike hole band persisting in the superconducting regime (in addition to a me

[20]) and for crystals **d** and **e** from Liu _et al._ (Ref. [21]). The dashed curves are fits of Eqs. (1)\(-\)(7) (fitted only below 120 K), and the full curves are fits to Eqs. (1)\(-\)(6) and (8) for our proposed electron-hole two band model. Potassium concentrations \(x\) and fit parameters are listed in Table 1.

  tallic term) as a possible explanation of the temperature dependence of thermopower.

To formulate a specific model, we start with the general expression for the overall thermopower for a two-band model, given by

\[S = \frac{\sigma_{e}}{\sigma}S_{e} + \frac{\sigma_{h}}{\sigma}S_{h}\,,\]

where \(S_{e}\) is the thermopower characteristic of the dominant metallic band and \(S_{h}\) is the thermopower of the holelike band. The contributions from \(S_{e}\) and \(S_{h}\) are each weighted by the respective conductivities, \(s_{e}\) and \(s_{h}\). The overall conductivity, \(s\), is

\[\sigma = \sigma_{e} + \sigma_{h}\,.\]

We model the resistivity of a metallic band, \(r_{e}\) = 1/_s__e_ , using a generalized Bloch-Gruneisen formula which yields a _T_\({}^{p}\) power-law behavior at low temperatures and gives a good representation of the measured resistivity of the crystal samples:

\[\rho_{e} = A + B{T}^{p} \int_{0}^{\theta/T} \frac{x^{p}}{(e^{x} - 1)(1 - e^{- x})}\,dx,\]

where \(A\) and \(B\) are constants and _th_ corresponds to an effective cutoff energy (the Debye temperature for scattering of carriers by phonons). Setting \(p\) = 2 recovers the standard form of the Bloch-Gruneisen expression for electron-phonon scattering.27 The values of the parameters used are those that give a fit to the resistivity data corresponding to the particular thermopower data we wish to study (the values of \(p\) vary from 1.3 for crystal **a** to 2.5 for crystal **e**).

For metallic thermopower we use the standard formula28

\[S_{e} = \frac{1}{e{T}\sigma_{e}}\int\,(\varepsilon - \mu)\frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial\varepsilon}\,\sigma_{e}(\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon.\]

A linear metallic thermopower with a negative slope, appropriate for the overdoped regime, follows from the usual linear expansion for the energy-dependent conductivity, \(s_{e}\)(_e_);

\[\sigma_{e}(\varepsilon) = 1 + c_{e}\varepsilon,\]

where energy \(e\) is measured from the Fermi level, and \(c_{e}\) > 0 for electronlike behavior.

Following Hashimoto _et al._,25 we also consider a holelike band in which conduction is thermally activated, with conductivity given by

\[\sigma_{h} = \sigma_{0}\exp( - E_{h}/T),\]

where \(E_{h}\) is the activation energy and \(s\)0 is a constant, and thermopower given by

\[S_{h} = |k/e|(E_{h}/T + C),\]

where \(C\) is a constant and |_k_/_e_| has the standard value |_k_/_e_| = 86.17 \(\mu\)V K\({}^{- 1}\). Such activated holes could possibly make a significant contribution to thermopower in a very low conductivity metal such as BKBO, with the contribution to thermopower being much larger than that to conductivity since the thermopower for semiconductor conduction is typically much larger than that for metallic conduction.

Using Eqs. (1)-(7) we can obtain reasonable fits to the BKBO thermopower data for temperatures \(T\) <= 120 K, as shown by the dashed curves in Fig. 2. The positive thermopower peak at low temperatures arises from contributions from Eqs. (6) and (7) due to the hole carriers. On the one hand, the 1/_T_ dependence in Eq. (7) causes the thermopower to increase with decreasing temperature but, as \(T\) ~ 0, the weighting factor in Eq. (1) with conductivity given by Eq. (6) becomes extremely small and this causes the thermopower to decrease to zero as \(T\) ~ 0.

From these fits we can determine, for each data set, the activation energy \(E_{h}\) , the relative contribution of localized carriers to transport at room temperature compared with metallic carriers, \(s_{h}\)(300 K)/_s__e_(300 K), and the normalized slope of the linear energy dependence for the metallic wide band at the Fermi level, \(c_{e}\) = \(d\) ln \(s_{e}\)(_e__F_)/_d__e_. Values for these parameters are given in Table 1 (the value of \(C\) was taken as zero, since it could not be adequately determined by fitting to the data). We see that the holes provide only a minor contribution to charge transport with \(s_{h}\)(300 K)/_s__e_(300 K) < 10%. Also, \(s_{h}\)(300 K)/_s__e_(300 K) decreases as the samples become more overdoped. This is consistent with the positive thermopower peak decreasing and the semiconducting carriers becoming insignificant as the samples are doped away from the metal-insulator transition into the overdoped regime. Values obtained for the activation energy are \(E_{h}\) < 10 meV. This is very small as required for a contribution to conductivity at relatively low temperatures. We show below that this contribution to electronic transport, while af

  fecting thermopower, has little effect on the temperature dependence of the total conductivity.

As shown by the dashed curves in Fig. 2, the upturn seen in the data above 120 K is not given by the above model. For the BaPb\({}_{0.75}\)Bi\({}_{0.25}\)O\({}_{3}\) data of Hashimoto _et al._,[25] there is no positive peak in the thermopower down to \(T_{c}\) , and the sharp increase in slope near 200 K is accounted for by a model similar to the above but with a greater activation energy for the hole conduction. In our case, only a modest change in slope is seen at around 120-150 K, which we can model by a simple extension of our model above. We find that this slope change is consistent with a nonlinearity in the energy-dependent conductivity \(\sigma(\varepsilon)\) , due to a nonlinear energy dependence of the density of states or other electronic parameters. There is a saddle point near the Fermi surface in the vicinity of the \(X\) point in the band-structure calculations of Mattheiss and Hamann[4] that appears to be associated with a decrease in the density of states at higher energies. We model this by a change in the normalized energy-dependent conductivity for energies \(\varepsilon\) greater than a value \(\varepsilon_{c}\) :
