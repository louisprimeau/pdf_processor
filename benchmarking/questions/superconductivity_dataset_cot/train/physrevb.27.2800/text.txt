###### Abstract

The low-temperature heat capacity of superconducting ternary iron silicides Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), and Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) has been measured, revealing several anomalous properties of the superconducting state of these materials. These materials show a large linear term in the superconducting heat capacity and a reduced normalized jump in the specific heat at \(T_{e}\). A two-band model is proposed to explain these properties and previously reported anomalous properties of superconducting ternary iron silicides.

## Introduction

Ternary superconductors, particularly the Chevrel phase compounds and the rhodium borides, have been extensively studied in recent years.[1, 2] A major motivation in this work has been the investigation of the competition between superconductivity and magnetism made possible by the presence of a sublattice of magnetic rare-earth atoms. The discovery of Sc\({}_{2}\)Co\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) with a superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{e}\)) of 4.9 K demonstrated that relatively high \(T_{e}\)'s may be found among compounds containing 3\(d\) transition elements as intrinsic constituents.[3]

Among binary-ion compounds only U\({}_{6}\)Fe (\(T_{e}\) = 3.9 K) (Ref. [4]) and Th\({}_{7}\)Fe\({}_{3}\) (\(T_{e}\) = 1.86 K) (Ref. [5]) are superconducting above 1 K. Recently five ternary compounds containing iron as the transition metal [\(M_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) with \(M\) = Lu,Sc,Y,Tm (Refs. [6] and [7]) and LaFe\({}_{4}\)P\({}_{12}\) (Ref. [8]) have been reported superconducting. The ternary-iron silicides, \(M_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) were first reported superconducting by Braun in 1980.[6] The properties of these materials are anomalous in several respects: (i) The effect of pressure on \(T_{e}\) is among the largest known (\(dT_{e}\)/\(dp\) = \(-\)7 x 10\({}^{-5}\) K/bar for Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and dT\({}_{e}\)/\(dp\) = 33 x 10\({}^{-5}\) K/bar for Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\)) (Ref. [9]; (ii) the rapid depression of \(T_{e}\) with nonmagnetic impurities (\(T_{e}\) drops below 1 K for 15% Sc substituted for Lu in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\)) (Ref. [10]); (iii) reentrant superconductivity has been reported in Tm\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (Ref. [7]); (iv) there is no magnetic moment on the iron in this structure as indicated by Mossbauer spectroscopy[11]\({}^{-}\)[13]; (v) a commensurate-incommensurate magnetic transition has been observed in antiferromagnetic Tb\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\).[14]

The low-temperature heat capacity for the compounds Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), and Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) is reported here as part of a systematic study of the low-temperature properties of \(M_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) materials (\(M\) = Sm, Gd-Lu, Sc, and Y). The low-temperature heat capacity of the magnetic rare-earth compounds will be reported elsewhere.

## SAMPLE PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION

Samples of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), and Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) of 3\(-\)4 g each were prepared by arc-melting stoichiometric mixtures of high-purity elements in a Zr-gettered argon atmosphere. The resulting ingots were then turned over and remelted at least six times to promote homogeneity. The samples were then sealed in quartz ampoules with about 300 Torr of argon and annealed at 1250 degC for five days followed by seven days at 800 degC. The resulting ingots were shiny, heavily faceted, hard, and brittle with cracks over much of the surface.

Powder x-ray diffraction confirms the presence of the 2:3:5 phase (space group \(P4\)/\(mnc\)) with lattice parameters in agreement with those reported by Braun.[6] Low-temperature powder x-ray diffraction indicates no structural transformation above 30 K. In each sample the x-rays show only one or two very weak lines not indexable to the 2:3:5 structure which are attributed to small amounts of impurities. Optical microscope investigations indicate large grains of 100\(-\)200 \(\mu\)m with small amounts of impurities along the grain boundaries. Microprobe results indicate two major impurities of approximate compositions FeSi and \(M\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\). Total impurities are estimated to be about 2% by volume in each sample.

Low-frequency ac inductance measurements indi cate superconducting transitions at 6.3, 4.4, and 1.7 K for Lu2Fe3Si5, Sc2Fe5Si5, and Y2Fe3Si5, respectively, in agreement with previous results.6, 9 The transitions are sharp (D_Tc_ = 0.2 K) and consistent with bulk superconductivity.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements from 5 to 250 K on a piece of the sample of Lu2Fe3Si5 used in the heat-capacity measurements indicate a paramagnetic susceptibility consistent with an upper limit of 14 ppm free iron. Similar measurements on samples of Sc2Fe3Si5 and Y2Fe3Si5 which were not used in the heat-capacity measurements indicate upper limits of 38 and 30 ppm free iron, respectively, in these samples. These data are shown in Fig. 1.

In addition to the above samples, a series of five samples Sc2Fe3+8Si5 (d = -0.5, -0.1,0.0,0.1,0.5) not used in the heat-capacity measurements were prepared to study the effect of stoichiometry on the superconducting properties. These samples were prepared with special attention to the relative amounts of Fe in each sample. From a master ingot of Sc2Si5, samples of Sc2Fe2.5Si5 and Sc2Fe3.5Si5 were prepared by adding the appropriate amounts of Fe. The remaining three samples (d = -0.1,0.0,0.1) were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of these two samples. The superconducting transition temperatures of these five samples are presented in Fig. 2, together with the _Tc_ of the sample of Sc2Fe3Si5 used in the heat-capacity study. X rays on the off-stoichiometry samples (d = 0.0) indicate increasing amounts of impurities with increasing \(\left| \delta \right|\). The rapid depression of _Tc_ and increased impurities with off stoichiometry indicate even a few percent of impurities can be readily identified. The results of x-ray diffraction, microprobe, _Tc_ measurements, and effects of stoichiometry all indicate no more than a few percent impurities in the samples used in the heat-capacity measurements. The general high quality of the samples used in this study, particularly the samples of Lu2Fe3Si5 and Sc2Fe3Si5, and the extensive characterization of these samples play a major role in the discussion of the results below.

## EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Low-temperature heat-capacity measurements were performed using a semiadiabatic heat pulse-type calorimeter equipped with a mechanical heat switch, a circulating 4He pot and a circulating 3He pot. Mechanical noise introduced while operating the 3He system prohibited accurate data acquisition below 1 K. during the measurements, limiting the usable temperature range to 1.2-30 K. This problem has since been corrected extending the usable temperature range to at least 0.5 K.

The sample holder consists of gold-plated copper in a clamp arrangement, providing good mechanical and thermal contact between the sample and the sample holder. The sample holder is supported by a rigid, thin-walled, low-thermal-conductivity nylon support providing good mechanical stability. A mechanical heat switch and thermal shield with a heater provide ambient temperature control. A four-probe method was used to simultaneously measure the current and voltage during each heat pulse of a 1000-\(\Omega\) Pt-W heater on the sample holder. The duration of the heater pulse is measured with a commercial digital timer. The determination of the total heat applied to the sample is believed to introduce no more than 0.1% error to the final heat capacity.

  The thermometry consists of a germanium resistance thermometer (GRT) and a commercially available potentiometric conductance bridge. The GRT was selected for its extended usable temperature range (0.3-30 K) and calibrated in this laboratory in the range 0.9-30 K against a GRT known for its stablity and reliability as a secondary standard. The calibration procedure and equipment is described in Ref. 15. A second calibration, overlapping this one, was performed from 0.3 -2.0 K against a GRT calibrated in this range by the manufacturer. The GRT thermometry is believed accurate to at least +-5 mK at 20 K and +-1 mK below 4 K. The temperature change during a heat pulse is determined by monitoring the GRT conductance on a strip-chart recorder. This graphical procedure is believed to be the principal source of random error in these measurements.

As a check of the equipment and procedures used, several runs were performed to determine the heat capacity of the addenda (sample holder, thermometer, heater, and GE 7031 varnish) and a piece of high-purity copper. The resulting overall precision in each run and agreement between different runs was typically better than 0.5%. After correcting for the addenda, the precision of the data on copper was better than 1% and yielded \(g\) = 0.688 mJ/mole K2 and \(\Theta_{D} = 345\) K, in good agreement with the corresponding values for the copper reference equation.16

## RESULTS

The low-temperature heat capacities of Lu2Fe3Si5, Sc2Fe3Si5, and Y2Fe3Si5 are shown in Figs. 3-5, respectively, where _C/T_ is plotted against \(T\)2 in the usual manner. A jump in the heat capacity at 6.3, 4.4, and 1.7 K for Lu2Fe3Si5, Sc2Fe3Si5, and Y2Fe3Si5, respectively, indicates the transition into the superconducting state. Deviations from linearity above \(T_{e}\), especially in Lu2Fe3Si5, are apparent. In

  each case the data were fit in the temperature range from above \(T_{e}\) to 18 K to \(C = \gamma_{n}T + \beta_{n}T^{3} + \alpha_{n}T^{5}\) with a root-mean-square deviation of about 1% (see Table 1). In each case the lattice contribution (\(\beta_{n}T^{3} + \alpha_{n}T^{5}\)) represents less than 20% of the total heat capacity at \(T_{e}\). In the case of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\) the \(T^{5}\) term is quite large, contributing 13% of the total heat capacity at 10 K. The rapid variation of the lattice contribution and the higher \(T_{e}\) (6.3 K) contribute somewhat smaller and larger values, respectively, than the values resulting from the fit. No such discrepancy exists for Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\), where the normal

  state data is more well behaved (i.e., the \(T^{5}\) contribution is smaller) and \(T_{c}\) is lower.

The jump in the specific heat at \(T_{c}\) is sharp for Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (\(\Delta T_{e}\) = 0.3 K) and Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) (\(\Delta T_{e}\) = 0.35 K). The jump at \(T_{c}\) for Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) is relatively broad (\(\Delta T_{e}\) = 0.5 K) with significant contributions to \(C(T)\) from the superconducting state as high as 2 K. The somewhat lower value of \(T_{c}\) than previously reported [6] and the broadened transition into the superconducting state suggests the Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) sample is somewhat lower in quality than the other two samples. In each case the normalized jump in the heat capacity at \(T_{c}\), \(\Delta C/\gamma_{n}T_{c}\), is significantly reduced from the BCS value of 1.43 (see Table I), being less than 60% of the BCS value for Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) and Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\). Electron-phonon coupling constants calculated using McMillan's formula [17] with \(\mu^{\star}\) = 0.1 (Table I) indicate these materials are intermediate-coupled superconductors.

Below \(T_{c}\) the heat capacity of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) is remarkably simple (see inset Fig. 2). From 2.4 to 6 K the data can be described by \(C\) = \(\gamma_{s}T\) + \(\beta_{s}T^{3}\) = 10.14\(T\) = 1.346\(T^{3}\) mJ/mole K to within experimental error (0.7%). The linear term here is about 35% of the linear term in the normal state. Below 2.4 K a small anomaly consistent with 1-2 % of impurities entering a superconducting state is evident. The heat capacity of Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) below \(T_{c}\) similarly shows a large linear term (see inset Fig. 3). Extrapolation of the lowest temperature data for Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) indicate \(\gamma_{s}\) = 13.6 mJ/mole K [2] or 61% of the normal-state coefficient of the linear term (\(\gamma_{n}\) = 22.2 mJ/mole K [2]). The data on Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) do not extend sufficiently below the \(T_{c}\) of this sample to permit estimating \(\gamma_{s}\); however, entropy matching considerations suggest \(\gamma_{s}\) \(\neq\) 0 in this case also.

## Discussion

The anomalously large \(T^{5}\) contribution observed in the normal state heat capacities of these materials, especially in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\), suggests a rather complex phonon density of states. Deviation from \(T^{3}\) in the lattice contribution to the heat capacity has been reported for other ternary superconductors [18, 19] and may be a rather general consequence of the complex phonon density of states which may be expected from the complex crystal structures of these materials.

More notable are the results for measurements in the superconducting states of these materials. The reduced normalized jump at \(T_{c}\) and the large linear term below \(T_{c}\), evident in these data, are quite unusual. There are several possible origins for a linear term in the superconducting specific heat and a reduced normalized jump at \(T_{c}\): (i) the presence of bulk amounts of normal impurities or large inhomogeneities, (ii) presence of small amounts of impurities with a large \(\gamma\), (iii) a gapless or mixed superconducting state induced by some pair breaking mechanism, or (iv) the existence of a region (or regions) of the Fermi surface which does not participate in superconductivity. We will consider each of these broad catergories in turn.

The rather extensive characterizations of the samples discussed above serve to address (i) and (ii). Estimating conservatively there are at most 5% impurities in any of these samples. Further, the microprobe results indicate those impurities are concentrated at the grain boundaries and are not incorporated into the 2:3:5 phase matrix. The sharpness of the transition into the superconducting state as indicated in both ac inductance and heat-capacity measurements indicates good sample homogeneity, ruling out (i) above.

Attributing \(\gamma_{s}\) in Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) to impurities of 5% of the material yields a \(\gamma_{\rm imp}\) = 0.31 mJ/g K [2]. This is much larger than the \(\gamma\) of any of the elements, except \(\alpha\)-Mn (\(\gamma\) = 0.32 mJ/g K [2]). [20] This comparison becomes worse, indicating an even larger, \(\gamma_{\rm imp}\) for the case of Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{5}\) or if impurities constitute less

  than 5% of the material, as is very likely. Thus (ii) leads to unreasonable estimates for the heat capacity of the supposed impurities. Turning now to (iii), several sources of pair breaking are plausible in view of the large concentration of Fe present in these materials. However, the magnetic susceptibility measurements shown in Fig. 1 indicate paramagnetic impurities are present in concentrations too low to play a major role in the superconducting properties of these materials. Regardless of the source of the pair breaking, however, a large amount of pair breaking would be required to induce the large linear terms observed. This would imply a \(T_{\epsilon}\) in the absence of pair breaking at least several degrees higher than observed in these materials. No evidence of larger \(T_{\epsilon}\)'s has been found in our work, nor reported in the literature. This implies the source of pair breaking would have to be intrinsic to the material and nearly independent of preparation technique. The absence of a moment on the iron atoms as indicated by Mossbauer studies\({}^{11-13}\) and the absence of clear multiplet splitting due to the Fe in x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements on our samples suggest the iron is not the source of pair breaking. While an intrinsic pair breaking mechanism cannot be entirely ruled out at this time, it does seem highly unlikely.

This leaves (iv) which is essentially a two-band model in which one band remains normal. This is entirely consistent with our results, with \(\gamma_{s}\) representing the density of states of the normal band and \(\gamma_{n}\) the total density of states. In order for the normal band to remain stable against condensation of Cooper pairs it must have a net repulsive electron-electron interaction and be at most very weakly coupled with the superconducting band(s) (see, for example, Ref. 21). The topologically complex Fermi surfaces typical of 3\(d\) transition metals, and especially so for ternary materials, may well provide the necessary pockets of electrons to explain the anomalous superconducting properties of these materials. The dramatic pressure and alloying properties can be understood in this model as arising from the rapid changes which might be expected in these pockets of electrons, both in surface area of the pockets in momentum space and topology of the surface in general, with a pressurelike variable. Band-structure calculations would be very useful in this respect.

## Summary

Anomalous behavior is observed in the superconducting properties of Lu\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\), Sc\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\), and Y\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{5}\). Low-temperature specific-heat measurements indicate a large linear term in the superconducting state and a reduced jump in the specific heat significantly less than the BCS value of 1.43, indicating normal electrons in the superconducting state. These properties can all be understood in terms of a topologically complex Fermi surface in which pockets of electrons remain in the normal state well below \(T_{\epsilon}\).
