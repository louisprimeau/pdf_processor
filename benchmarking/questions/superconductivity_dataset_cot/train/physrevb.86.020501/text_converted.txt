###### Abstract

We report on superconductivity in CeFeAs1-xPxO and the possible
coexistence with Ce ferromagnetism (FM) in a small homogeneity range
around x = 30

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.86.020501

One interesting aspect of iron arsenides is the large variety of
possible manipulations that result in superconductivity starting from
antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered parent compounds. Taking LaFeAsO as
an example, superconductivity (SC) can be induced by pressure,¹ oxygen
vacancies,² or substitution of any of the elements, e.g., La → Sr,³ Fe →
Co,⁴ As → P,⁵ or O → F.⁶ The suppression of AFM ordering of Fe is
leading to a superconducting ground state in all of these cases. This is
a very general property of the Fe-based superconductors and in fact
there are only a few examples known where SC does not show up despite
vanishing Fe ordering [e.g., Mn-doped LaFeAsO⁷ or BaFe₂As₂³]. In this
sense CeFeAs1-xPxO presents a unique situation because of the following:
First, replacing As with P "usually" results in SC as shown for ArFe2As2
[_A_ = Ca,⁹ Ba,¹⁰ Sr,⁹ Eu¹¹] and _R_FeAsO [_R_ = La,⁵ Sm¹²], and second,
CeFeAsO becomes superconducting when substituting Fe with Co¹³ or O with
F¹⁴ and also by inducing oxygen vacancies.² But combining P doping with
R = Ce among the _R_FeAsO compounds results in exceptional behavior: The
Fe ordering is suppressed, as shown by de la Cruz _et al.¹⁵_ and Luo _et
al.¹⁶_ however, superconductivity had not yet been observed in
CeFeAs1-xPxO. Instead a crossover to ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of Ce
was reported at a critical concentration of x 40

Polycrystalline and single crystalline materials were synthesized as
described in Ref. 17. Phosphorous concentrations x are given in nominal
values. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis and x-ray powder diffraction
(using Vegard’s rule) set an upper limit for the error in x of 8

Figure 1 shows the suppression of the Fe-AFM ordering in P-doped CeFeAsO
(a) and in CeFeAs0.78P0.22O under hydrostatic pressure (b). The P
doping, acting as chemical pressure, leads to an effective suppression
of $T_{\rm{N}}^{\rm{Fe}}$, similar to Co or F doping. Whereas a broad
superconducting dome was observed for the latter one, CeFeAs1-xPxO shows
zero resistivity only in a narrow concentration range around x 30

Electrical resistivity at low temperatures is shown in Fig. 2(a) for
several P concentrations. Zero resistivity is observed only for x = 30

The emergence of SC in CeFeAs_(1 − x)P_(x)O is correlated with a
weakening of the AFM-Fe ordering at x = 30

The simultaneous occurrence of FM and SC at
$T_{\rm C}\congeq T_{\rm SC}\congeq 4$ K precludes the proof of bulk
superconductivity because specific heat and magnetic susceptibility at
these temperatures are completely dominated by the FM ordering of the Ce
moments. A comparison with UCoGe, one of the few established FM
superconductors, supports this possibility since the diamagnetic signal
at $T_{\rm SC}$ can be small compared to the anomaly at $T_{\rm C}$
(Ref. [21]) and a Meissner phase might be even completely absent when
the internal FM field is larger than $H_{\rm cl}$[22]. From the
stabilization of FM ordering for

Figure 3(a) shows the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha_{\rm i}$
measured along and perpendicular to the c axis. In contrast to undoped
CeFeAsO,[17]α_( ⊥ c) is small and almost constant for 20 K  < T< 190 K.
In particular, it lacks any indication for a structural transition
toward the orthorhombic phase. Note that thermal expansion is very
sensitive to structural phase transitions, usually more sensitive than
XRD, due to its higher resolution. These results are consistent with the
XRD pattern which show neither a splitting nor a broadening of the 220
reflection [the inset in Fig. 3(a)]. Along the c axis, a broad negative
$\alpha_{\rm i\perp}$ anomaly, centered around 70 K, is observed which
is related to the onset of Fe ordering as evidenced by a comparison with
the μSR results (see below). Between T = 10 and 100 K the length change
amounts to $\Delta l/l_{\rm fc}=-6.9\times 10^{-4}$, which is in good
agreement with the value of $\Delta l/l_{\rm fc}=-5.3\times 10^{-4}$
determined from XRD on polycrystalline material.

Figure 3(b) shows the development of the magnetic volume fraction of
CeFeAs_(0.70)P_(0.30)O as determined from weak transverse field μSR
measurements. We find that static magnetic order gradually develops
below T = 70 K down to 10 K, as displayed in the main panel. In the
upper inset of Fig. 3(b) we show representative zero-field (ZF) μSR data
at 1.6, 10, 40, and 180 K. At high T, the muon-spin polarization P(t) is
well described by the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe (GKT) function
$P(t)=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2}[1-(\sigma t)^{2}]\exp(\frac{i}{2}\sigma^{2}t^{2})$,
as expected for static and randomly oriented magnetic fields originating
from nuclear moments only.[23] This means that at 180 K
CeFeAs_(0.70)P_(0.30)O is in the paramagnetic (PM) state and that the
electronic Fe-3d and Ce-4f moments are rapidly fluctuating, so that the
resulting muon depolarization is small compared with the nuclear
contribution. Below T≈ 70 K, an additional exponential depolarization
gradually develops with decreasing T on the cost of the PM GKT signal.
The exponential behavior indicates that this relaxation stems from
static or slowly fluctuating electronic moments. Longitudinal field (LF)
μSR experiments can distinguish between these two scenarios.[23] Our
LF-μSR measurements at 40 K prove the predominantly static character of
the internal magnetic fields most likely due to short-ranged ordered
Fe-3d electronic moments with a small dynamic contribution, as displayed
in the lower inset of Fig. 3(b).

Therefore, the data shown in Fig. 3 give evidence for static magnetic
ordering of Fe in the absence of an orthorhombic distortion-a scenario
which is in contrast to the widely discussed nematic model for Fe-based
superconductors. On the other hand, the development of static AFM order
in CeFeAs_(1 − x)P_(x)O instead of AFM fluctuations existing in a
nematic phase might be the origin for the absence of high-temperature SC
in this alloy series.

Finally we report the discovery of a sharp ESR signal for a certain
range of x which confirms the relevance of FM fluctuations for its
observation.[24] Figure 4(a) shows the ESR signal for x = 35

c axis. The sharp peaks below 15 K are connected to the magnetic
ordering of Ce. Inset: Synchrotron XRD pattern close to the 220

H_(c1) = 70 Oe was estimated from the maximum in dP/dH.

The main results are summarized in the phase diagram in Fig. 4(d).
Transition temperatures are determined by means of electrical
resistivity (first and second derivative), μSR (50

The suppression of the Fe-AFM ordering alone is not sufficient for the
emergence of Ce-FM ordering as shown by F- and Co-doping studies.[13,
14] Therefore, the origin for this behavior is more complex than a
possible simple sign change of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
interaction and will hopefully stimulate further theoretical
investigations. For x > 70

In summary, CeFeAs_(1 − x)P_(x)O was found to be one of the rare
examples showing a close proximity of superconductivity and
ferromagnetism. The formation of static Fe ordering in the absence of an
orthorhombic distortion is the main difference between P-doped CeFeAsO
investigated here and the other Fe-based superconductors which have
higher T_(C) values. This indirectly supports the relevance of nematic
fluctuations for the emergence of higher critical temperatures.
