###### Abstract

We measured the microwave surface impedances and obtained the superfluid
density and flux flow resistivity in single crystals of a phosphor-doped
iron-based superconductor SrFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ single crystals (x =
0.30, T_(c) = 25 K). At low temperatures, the superfluid density,
n_(s)(T)/n_(s)(0), obeys a power law,
n_(s)(T)/n_(s)(0) = 1 − C(T/T_(c))^(n), with a fractional exponent of
n = 1.5-1.6. The flux flow resistivity was significantly enhanced at low
magnetic fields. These features are consistent with the presence of line
nodes on at least one band and modulated nodeless gap with deep minimum
on the same bands and/or other bands. The remarkable difference observed
in the superconducting gap structure between SrFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ and
BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ in our experiments is important for clarifying
the mechanism of iron-based superconductivity in the 122 system.

The symmetry of the superconducting (SC) order parameter is closely
related to the pairing interaction and is an important problem for
iron-based superconductors.[1] While nodeless ε±-wave symmetry mediated
by antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuation has been considered to be a
very likely candidate,[2, 3] it has been revealed that many compounds
have line nodes in their SC gap function. P-substituted systems are
especially interesting in terms of the effect of the local structure
parameter on the SC gap function. Kuroki _et al._ suggested that line
nodes appear in the SC gap function when the pnictogen height from the
Fe-As plane decreases.[4, 5] One can experimentally control the
pnictogen height and induce superconductivity through the isovalent
substitution of As by P in the 122 system. BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.3))₂
(T_(c)∼ 30 K) is one of the most intensively studied P-substituted
compounds.[6] London penetration depth measurement[7] provides an
evidence of line nodes as other P-substituted iron-based SCs, such as
LaFePO (Ref. [8]) and LiFeP,[9] and the presence of closed nodal loops
in the flat region of the electron Fermi surface was proposed based on
an angle-resolved thermal conductivity measurement.[10] On the other
hand, it has been theoretically suggested that P substitution warps the
outer hole Fermi surface and weakens the nesting between the hole and
electron Fermi surfaces. This action reduces the two dimensionality of
the spin fluctuation, which results in the appearance of
three-dimensional nodes on the outer hole sheet.[5] Therefore, there is
no consensus on the detailed structure of the nodes. Another important
consideration is to determine why the P-substituted Ba122 compounds have
rather high T_(c) values, even in the presence of nodes. Therefore, it
is of critical importance to investigate the SC gap structure in other
P-doped systems.

In this paper, we focus on a different 122 system, namely the Sr122
system. The parent compound SrFe₂As₂ exhibits a maximum transition
temperature of $T_{c}^{\rm max}=32$ K at high pressures (P = 5 GPa).[11]
Around the optimum pressure, nuclear magnetic resonance measurements
have revealed the SC/AF hybrid state and the development of spin
fluctuation toward T_(c).[12] The chemical substitution is also
effective in inducing superconductivity.[13, 14, 15, 16] We measured the
microwave surface impedances of SrFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ single crystals
(x = 0.30, T_(c) = 25 K) to investigate the SC gap structure. We found
that the low-temperature superfluid density n_(s) and the flux flow
resistivity ρ_(f) at low fields are consistent with the presence of a SC
gap that has line nodes. However, remarkable differences from
BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.3))₂ were also found in the details of the SC gap,
which is important for clarifying the mechanism of iron-based
superconductivity in the 122 system.

Single crystals of SrFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂ were grown using the SrAs
self-flux method. Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis revealed that P
substituted 30

The surface impedance Z_(s) = R_(s) − iX_(s), where R_(s) is the surface
resistance and X_(s) is the surface reactance, was measured using a
cavity perturbation technique. We used two kinds of cylindrical
oxygen-free Cu cavity resonators, operating in the TE_(0.11) mode at 19
and 44 GHz, which had quality factors Q of ∼60 000 (19 GHz) and 26 000
(44 GHz), respectively. A piece of the crystal was mounted on a sapphire
rod and was placed in the antinode of the microwave magnetic field
H_(o). The shielding current flows in the ab planes because H_(o) is
parallel to the c axis. In this technique, one measures the changes of Q
and the resonant frequency f of the resonator that result from the
introduction of a sufficiently small sample. The shifts in the inverse
of Q and f are proportional to R_(s) and X_(s), respectively. The
absolute values of Z_(s) were obtained by assuming the Hagen-Rubens
limit (ωτ ≪ 1),
$R_{s}=X_{s}=(\mu_{0}\omega\rho/2)^{1/2}=\frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}\omega\delta$,
above the T_(c) (ω = 2πf is the angular frequency, τ is the
quasiparticle scattering time, μ₀ is the permeability in vacuum, and δ
is the skin depth).

In the SC state effective penetration depth
($X_{s}=\mu_{0}\omega\lambda_{\rm eff}$), $\lambda_{\rm eff}$ coincides
with the London penetration depth λ_(L) in the clean local limit. Most
iron-based superconductors are in this limit over the wide temperature
range below T_(c). Therefore, we can obtain the superfluid density
n_(s)(T)/n_(s)(0) = λ_(L)²(0)/λ_(L)²(T) via the London equation
λ_(L)⁻² = μ₀n_(s)e²/m^(*), which will provide information about the SC
gap structure, particularly the presence or the absence of nodes in the
gap.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of microwave surface
impedances of SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂. All crystals for Z_(s)
measurements were cleaved from the same batch as that used for the dc
resistivity and the dc magnetic susceptibility measurements, and formed
so that they had dimensions about 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.1 mm³. The temperature
dependence of R_(s) and X_(s) in the normal state are in good agreement
with each other. Therefore, we were able to determine the absolute value
of the London penetration depth with good reproducibility by assuming
the Hagen-Rubens relation. The London penetration depth at 0 K is
270 ± 10 nm. This value is comparable to those of other optimally doped
122 compounds.[7, 18] The superfluid density measured at two different
frequencies (see the inset in Fig. 3) are in very good agreement, which
indicates a good reliability of the absolute value of λ_(L).

The temperature dependence of the superfluid densities,
n_(s)(T)/n_(s)(0), up to 0.3T_(c) is shown in Fig. 3. At low
temperatures (T ≪ T_(c)/2), n_(s)(T)/n_(s)(0) is expressed for the
nodeless superconductor as

$$\frac{n_{s}(T)}{n_{s}(0)}=1-\sqrt{\frac{2\pi\,\Delta_{\rm min}}{k_{B}T}}\exp \left(-\frac{\Delta_{\rm min}}{k_{B}T}\right),$$
(1)

where $\Delta_{\rm min}$ is the minimum amplitude of the SC gap, and it
is expressed for superconductors with line nodes, as

$$\frac{n_{s}(T)}{n_{s}(0)}=1-\alpha T,$$
(2)

where α is a constant. We note that the discussion on the temperature
dependence of n_(s) is essentially the same as that on
δλ_(L)(T) = λ_(L)(T) − λ_(L)(0) at low temperatures because
n_(s)(T)/n_(s)(0) ≃ 1 − 2δλ_(L)/λ_(L)(0) when δλ_(L)/λ_(L)(0) ≪ 1. For
BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂, T-linear λ(T) is observed and it is
considered to be an evidence of the presence of line nodes.[7] On the
other hand, for SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂, the data were well fitted by a
power law, n_(s)(T)/n_(s)(0) = 1 − C(T/T_(c))^(n) (C is a constant
coefficient), with a fractional exponent, n ≃ 1.6, and n did not depend
on the fitting temperature range. The power law has been observed in
many iron-based compounds.[18] However, the values of the exponents are
2 or greater in most cases. For the case of s±-wave superconductors, the
intrinsic exponential temperature dependence of λ_(L)(T) changes to
exhibit a power-law behavior when nonmagnetic impurity is
introduced.[19] As impurity increases, the exponent decreases from n > 3
to n ≃ 2.[20, 21] In other words, T² behavior appears

The hump appears at T_(c) in the X_(s) data because the characteristic
field-penetration length changes from δ (in the normal state) to λ (>2δ
in the SC state) within a narrow temperature range.

in the disordered limit. However, the residual resistivity of
approximately 50 μΩ cm in the SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂ is considerably
smaller than that in other iron-based superconductors where T² behavior
has been observed, for example in Ni-doped and Co-doped compounds.[20,
22] This indicates that the exponent n ≃ 1.6 is induced by the intrinsic
nature of the SC gap structure and not by impurity scattering. An
exponent n ≃ 1.6, which is somewhat larger than the exponent values in
other P-substituted systems, indicates that there is another channel of
low-energy quasiparticle excitations in addition to the SC gap with line
nodes.

To obtain further insights into the gap structure, we measured Z_(s)
under finite magnetic fields and extracted the flux flow resistivity
ρ_(f). Figure 4 shows the magnetic-field dependence of Z_(s) at
different temperatures. We performed experiments under both field-cooled
and zero-field-cooled conditions and confirmed that there were no
significant effects of vortex pinning on Z_(s) in a wide H range, except
for very low fields below 0.5 T where a small degree of hysteresis
appeared. In other words, the vortices are distributed homogeneously in
the samples. We used the Coffey-Clem model to analyze Z_(s).[23] In this
model, at sufficiently lower temperature below T_(c) where the
normal-fluid contribution and thermally excited flux creep are
negligibly small, surface impedance in the mixed state (H ≫ H_(c1)) can
be expressed as

$$Z_{s}=-i\mu_{0}\omega\sqrt{\lambda_{L}^{2}+(i/2)\delta_{f}^{2}(1-i\omega_{p}/ \omega)^{-1}},$$
(3)

where $\delta_{f}=\sqrt{2\rho_{f}/\mu_{0}\omega}$ is the flux flow skin
depth. From this equation, we calculated the pinning frequency, ω_(p),
and ρ_(f).

Figure 5(a) illustrates the ω_(p) of SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂. ω_(p)
increases at low temperatures and at low fields, and it exceeds 30 GHz
at 2 K and 1 T, which is considerably larger than the values of 6 GHz
for LaFeAsO_(0.9)F_(0.1) (Ref. [24]) and 3 GHz for LiFeAs.[25] We can
also estimate the vortex viscous drag coefficient η = μ₀Hϕ₀/ρ_(f). This
parameter is related to the interval of discrete core bound states,
ω_(c) ∼ Δ²/E_(F) via η = πℏn_(c)ω_(c)τ, where τ is the quasiparticle
relaxation time in the vortex core and n_(c) is the carrier density.
ω_(c)τ was observed to be on the order of 10⁻¹, which indicates that the
vortex core is in the moderately clean regime.[26]

Figure 5(b) shows the magnetic-field dependence of ρ_(f). It is clear
that ρ_(f) exhibits a steeper increase at lower fields
(ρ_(f)/ρ_(n) > 2.5H/H_(c2) at 0.1H_(c2), where ρ_(n) is the resistivity
in the normal state and H_(c2) is the upper critical field) than it does
in the Bardeen and Stephen’s (BS) model,[27]ρ_(f)/ρ_(n) = H/H_(c2), and
in the nodeless superconductor LiFeAs (ρ_(f)/ρ_(n) ∼ 1.3H/H_(c2)).[25,
28] Note that it is important to correctly evaluate H_(c2)(2 K);
otherwise, ambiguity arises in the determination of the slope of
ρ_(f)(H). Here we use the value H_(c2)(2 K) = 50 T, because the H_(c2)
of SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂ has been measured up to H_(c2)(8 K) = 45 T
(Ref. [29]) by other groups, which results in H_(c2)(2 K) = 50 T with
the aid of Ginzburg-Landau theory. Because the H_(c2)(7) of iron-based
superconductors often exhibits a strong T dependence even at low
temperatures, H_(c2)(2 K) may be greater than 50 T. In that case, the
slope of ρ_(f)/ρ_(n) will be larger than that in our plot. Therefore,
our plot provides the lower limit of the possible slope. Even if
H_(c2)(2 K) is greater than 50 T, we can safely state that
ρ_(f)/ρ_(n) > 2.5H/H_(c2) at 0.1H_(c2).

According to the Kopnin and Volovik (KV) theory,[30] in the moderately
clean regime, ρ_(f) can be expressed as

$$\frac{\rho_{f}}{\rho_{n}}=\frac{\omega_{c}^{\rm max}}{\langle\omega_{c}({\bm{ k}})\rangle_{FS}}\frac{H}{H_{c2}},$$
(4)

where ⟨⋯⟩_(FS) denotes an average over the Fermi surface. For an s-wave
superconductor, this equation is reduced to the BS relation. However,
when the SC gap has nodes,
$\omega_{c}^{\rm max}/\langle\omega_{c}({\bm{k}})\rangle_{FS}$ becomes
larger than unity because ω_(c) depends on k, which results in the
enhancement of ρ_(f). For example, ρ_(f)/ρ_(n) ∼ 2H/H_(c2) is observed
in single-gap superconductors with line nodes.[31]

The solid line indicates the BS relation, ρ_(f)/ρ_(n) = H/H_(c2).

We would like to note two unusual features of ρ_(f), which cannot be
simply taken as the results of the presence of the line nodes confirmed
by λ_(L)(T). One is that the enhancement is considerably larger than
that in the single-gap superconductor with line nodes. In the simplified
phenomenological model of multigapped superconductors, quasiparticles
excited at different Fermi surfaces contribute to the flux flow
resistivity, similar to a parallel circuit,
ρ_(f)⁻¹ = ρ_(f, 1)⁻¹ + ρ_(f, 2)⁻¹ + ⋯[32]. Therefore, even if a nodal
gap exists, the ρ_(f) associated with nodeless gaps should suppress the
enhancement of the total ρ_(f). The other unusual feature is the
nonlinear H dependence. In both KV theory and the theory in Ref. [33],
ρ_(f) is linear in H at low fields. In addition, we observed that
ρ_(f) ∝ H in LiFeAs as shown in Fig. 5(b). [25] Nonlinear H dependence
and a steep initial gradient are also found in ρ_(f) for MgB₂. MgB₂ has
two distinct gaps where the gap amplitude ratio of the larger gap to the
smaller gap is Δ_(L)/Δ_(S) ∼ 3. Because the smaller gap is more
sensitive to H, quasiparticles excited in the smaller gap rapidly
increase with increasing H and enhance the flux flow resistivity at low
fields. [33] Therefore, the contribution from the smaller gap saturates
even far below H_(c2). In such a situation, ρ_(f) may not be linear in
H. Because SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂ is also a multigap superconductor, it
is natural to conclude that the contribution from the very small gaps
mentioned above produces unusual features. However, note that we cannot
distinguish between the contribution from small gaps opening over an
entire Fermi sheet and that from a deep gap minimum on a limited part of
a Fermi sheet.

We now discuss the difference between SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂ and
BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂ in terms of the low-energy quasiparticle
excitation. The low-temperature λ_(L)(T) exhibits different behaviors
between these compounds: while BaFe₂(As_(0.67)P_(0.33))₂ exhibits nearly
T-linear λ_(L)(T), [7] we observed that λ_(L)(T) ∝ T^(1.6) in
SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂. As we already discussed, both behaviors are
consistent with the presence of a SC gap with line nodes. Therefore, we
consider that the origin of the difference between these two compounds
is related to the differences in the structure of the nodeless gaps. The
significant differences in the low-energy quasiparticle excitation
between these two compounds are also observed in the spin-relaxation
rate and the heat capacity. [34] Both quantities exhibit a considerably
larger residual density of states under magnetic fields in
SrFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂, which is consistent with the presence of the
very small gaps that we observed in ρ_(f). In the Sr122 system,
additional quasiparticle excitations appear by replacing Ba²⁺ with Sr²⁺.
By this substitution, three dimensionality becomes more significant. It
was suggested that three dimensionality can induce strong modulation of
the superconducting gap along the k_(z) direction. [35] Therefore, we
conclude that additional quasiparticle excitations observed in the above
experiments are related to the strong modulation of the SC gap structure
along the k_(z) direction rather than small gaps opening over a whole
Fermi sheet. We also believe that the fractional power of λ_(L)(T) is
due to the combination of quasiparticle excitations in the nodal gap and
the deep minimum in the nodeless gaps. In fact, Mishra _et al._[36]
calculated the magnetic penetration depth assuming the presence of
three-dimensional nodes or horizontal nodes and found that n can be
1.5-2 when there is a nodeless gap with deep minimum on other Fermi
surfaces.

In conclusion, we measured the microwave surface impedances of
SrFe₂(As_(0.7)P_(0.3))₂ single crystals. The superfluid density at low
temperatures obeys a power law, n_(s)(T)/n_(s)(0) = 1 − C(T/T_(c))^(n),
with a fractional exponent of n = 1.5-1.6. The flux flow resistivity
exhibits a very sharp increase with increasing H and a nonlinear field
dependence. These results indicate the presences of line nodes on at
least one band and modulated nodeless gap with deep minimum on the same
bands and or other bands. We argued that the details of the SC gap
structure depend on the size of the alkaline-earth ion between the Fe-As
layers in the 122 system. This result indicates that the replacement of
Ba²⁺ with Sr²⁺ mainly changes the part of the Fermi surface that does
not significantly affect high T_(c). In other words, it keeps the
important part for realizing high-T_(c) superconductivity unchanged.
Therefore, by comparing these two compounds in more detail, we will be
able to clarify the mechanism of iron-based superconductivity.
