###### Abstract

High-temperature superconductors with a T_{c} above 40 K have been found to be strongly correlated electron systems and to have a layered structure. Guided by these rules, Kamihara _et al._ [J. Am. Chem. Soc. **130**, 3296 (2008)] discovered a T_{c} up to 26 K in the layered La(O1-xFx)FeAs. By replacing La with trivalence rare-earth (RE) elements of smaller ionic radii, T_{c} has subsequently been raised to 41-52 K. Many theoretical models have been proposed that emphasize the important magnetic origin of superconductivity in this compound system and a possible further T_{c} enhancement in RE(O1-xFx)FeAs by compression. This later prediction appears to be supported by the pressure-induced T_{c} increase in La(O0.89F0.11)FeAs observed. Here we show that, in contrast to previous expectations, pressure can either suppress or enhance T_{c}, depending on the doping level, suggesting that a T_{c} exceeding 50 K may be found only in the yet-to-be discovered compound systems related to but different from RE(O1-xFx)FeAs and that the T_{c} of La(O1-xFx)FeAs and Sm(O1-xFx)FeAs may be further raised to about 50 K.

There exists in nature a large class of equiatomic quaternary layered compounds REO7Pn (RE=La, Nd, Sm, Gd; T =Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; Pn=P, As, Sb) with a tetragonal structure of the ZrCuSiAs type.1 The rare-earth transition oxypnictides REO7Pn consist of transition-metal pnictide (7Pn) layers sandwiched by rare-earth oxide (REO) layers. Similar to the cuprate high-temperature superconductors, the charge carriers are supposed to flow in the _T_Pn layers, while the REO layers inject charge carriers to the former via the so-called modulation doping while retaining the layer integrity of the _T_Pn layers. However, the coordination structure of REO7Pn is different from that of the high-T_{c} cuprates: The divalent T is tetrahedrally coordinated with four Pn ions, whereas the divalent Cu forms the fourfold square plane. Based on the above analysis, superconductivity was first discovered in LaOFeP with a T_{c}\sim 4 K.2 By increasing the carrier concentration through the partial replacement of O with F, the T_{c} was raised to \sim9 K. Shortly afterward, LaONiP was found to exhibit a T_{c}\sim 3 K.3 However, immense excitement did not arise until the very recent discovery of the 26 K superconductivity in the F-doped LaOFeAs.4 The refined x-ray diffraction data show that the oxidation numbers of REOFeAs are RE3+O2-Fee2+As3-, where the conducting iron arsenide (FeAs)1- layers are stacked alternately with the less conducting rare-earth (REO)1+ layers.1

Immediately after the discovery of a T_{c} of 26 K in La(O1-xFx)FeAs,4T_{c} was drastically raised to 43 K in Sm(O1-xFx)FeAs,5 followed by reports of a T_{c} of up to 41 K in Ce(O1-xFx)FeAs,652 K in Pr(O1-xFx)FeAs,7 and 50 K in Nd(O1-xFx)FeAs.8 These are the first instances that T_{c}'s above 40 K, the theoretical T_{c} limit prior to the discovery of the 93 K YBa2Cu3O7 superconducting cuprate,9 have been found outside the layered cuprate compound system. The recent discoveries have generated great enthusiasm about the future of high-temperature superconductivity. These Fe-based rare-earth oxyarsenides RE(O1-xFx)FeAs are expected to provide an alternative material base for studying the origin of high-temperature superconductivity and to offer a different avenue to achieving superconductivity at a temperature surpassing the record T_{c} of the cuprates. Indeed, the crucial role of the magnetic Fe element in the occurrence of the relatively high T_{c} in these compounds is unexpected, since the presence of magnetic ions tends to be antagonistic to the conventional _s_-wave superconductivity. Unconventional superconductivity has been proposed by many.10-18 Much higher T_{c} has also been suggested in this class of compounds by fine-tuning through doping and/or applying pressure.14,15,19 The suggestion appears to be consistent with the initial observation of the T_{c} increase of La(O1-xFx)FeAs due to the possible internal pressure induced by the replacement of La by the smaller rare-earth elements.5-8 It seems also to be corroborated by the T_{c} enhancement of La(O1-xFx)FeAs by external pressures at a rate of dT_{c}/dP\sim 1.2 K/GPa.19 This compound system is expected to have a softer characteristic15 and, when an enhanced T_{c} is achieved, may thus alleviate some of the burdens in high-temperature superconducting wire fabrication encountered for the second-generation superconducting wires that use YBa2Cu3O7. However, it is not clear whether such a positive pressure effect on T_{c} is true for all other superconducting rare-earth Fe oxyarsenides, whether the reported rapid saturation of T_{c} at \sim50 K with x is intrinsic, and whether pressure can further raise the T_{c} of those compounds with their T_{c} already over 50 K.

Band calculations show that the electronic structure of REOFeAs is quasi-two-dimensional and semi-metal-like at the verge of instabilities, suggesting the possible existence of different competing states against the superconducting state, such as spin-density wave (SDW), antiferromagnetism, and ferromagnetism.10-13 Indeed, magnetic, resistive, and optical measurements of REOFeAs display anomalies at \sim150 K,412 indicative of the opening of a SDW gap on cooling and partial reduction of the Fermi surface due to Fermi-surface nesting between the electrons and holes.[12] Doping through the partial replacement of O by F or application of external pressure is thus suggested to narrow and eventually eliminate the SDW gap, leading to the appearance of superconductivity. This appears to be supported by the experimental observations that superconductivity takes place as soon as the 150 K resistive anomaly is suppressed by F doping. However, the rapid rise in T_{c} of RE(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs to its x-insensitive maximum plateau is different from the cuprates and not yet understood. The complexity in sample preparation of RE(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs may be able to account, at least partially, for the observation. The exact effect of SDW on superconductivity in these compounds remains unclear. Examining the pressure influence on SDW may provide an insight into the relationship between the two phenomena without chemical complications in doping. To address some of the questions raised above, we have chosen to investigate the pressure effect on the Sm(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs samples with nominal x=0, 0.05, 0.13, and 0.3, covering the nonsuperconducting and the superconducting regions.

All samples were prepared by solid-state reaction with the precautions described previously.[4, 5] X-ray spectra show the typical diffraction profile for Sm(O/F)FeAs (Fig. 1). Various impurity phases are detected in particular for x=0.3 as indicated in Fig. 1. The dc magnetization for the superconducting samples was measured in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) at ambient pressure. Samples used for resistivity measurements had a typical size of 3 mm length and an area of 1 mm^{2}. The resistance was measured using the standard four-lead technique. The electrical contacts were made by attaching platinum wires using silver paint. The contact resistance was on the order of a few ohms. The low-frequency (19 Hz) resistance bridge (LR700) was employed for resistivity measurements. High-pressure measurements were carried out employing the Be-Cu clamp method with the pressure determined by the Pb-pressure gauge.[20] A mixture of Fluorinert 70 and 77 liquid was used as the pressure transmitting medium.

The magnetic susceptibility of the superconducting samples was measured at ambient pressure in 5 Oe. The diamagnetic shielding signal corresponds to >30% of superconducting volume fraction for both samples. This value is reasonable in view of the nonsuperconducting impurity phases present in the samples. The resistance (R) variations with temperature in our samples are in agreement with previous reports. A R maximum at T_{\rm SDW} indicative of the onset of magnetic order (SDW) is evident in the x=0 and 0.05 nonsuperconducting samples with T_{\rm SDW} decreasing from 150 to 125 K at ambient pressure but not in the x=0.13 and 0.3 superconducting samples with an onset T_{c} increasing from \sim30 to \sim48 K (Fig. 2), consistent with the F-doping effects expected from theoretical predictions.

Under pressure, the room temperature R of the x=0.3 sample decreases rapidly with initial pressure increase and continues to decrease, but only slowly, at higher pressures during the pressure-increase cycle, perhaps due to an initial pressure-induced compaction of the sample. However, pressure reduction results in an irreversible R increase, attributed to the pressure-induced degradation of the sample. To define the superconducting T_{c} consistently, we have taken the inflection point temperature of the R-T curve or the peak temperature of the dR/dT vs T plot as our T_{c}. A T_{c} defined as such is expected to be lower than the previously reported T_{c}'s, most of which referred to the onset temperatures. The T_{c} of the x=0.3 sample is suppressed by pressure at a rate of dT_{c}/dP\sim-2.3 K/GPa (Fig. 3), in contrast to previous suggestions. It should be noted that the T_{c} of 42.5 K upon the complete release of pressure is slightly lower than the starting value, probably due to the combination effect of sample degradation and the residual pressure locked in the high-pressure cell. On the other hand, for the x=0.13 sample, T_{c} increases with pressure from 24.7 to 25.55 K at 0.94 GPa at a rate of \sim0.9 K/GPa and then stays at 25.55 K at higher pressures (Fig. 4), while the room temperature R varies with pressure as in the x=0.3 sample. The T_{c} after the complete release of pressure became higher, attributable to the sample change and the residual stress. Therefore, pressure effects on the T_{c} of the two samples examined are reversible except when the pressure is finally removed. The latter can be due to the polycrystallinity and low density of the samples, which

  raises the possibility that the release of pressure may weaken the interactions between grains. The unusual pressure dependence of T_{c} of this sample observed may be a reflection of the fine electronic structure near the Fermi surface. To study the behavior of the SDW state under pressure, we measured only the x = 0.05 nonsuperconducting sample. It is evident that the R peak is suppressed by pressure (Fig. 5). For better definition, we take T_{\rm SDW} as the peak temperature of dR/dT; the suppression of the SDW state by pressure is shown in Fig. 5.

In contrast to theoretical predictions that F doping and pressure would have the same effect in suppressing the SDW state and enhancing the superconducting state of Sm(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs,[12, 15, 19] we found that pressure can either promote or suppress the superconducting state, depending on the doping level of x, whereas pressure always suppresses the SDW state. It has been shown that the T_{c} of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors varies with carrier concentration (n) following a universal parabolic rule with T_{c} peaks at a carrier concentration n_{0}.[21]T_{c} increases with n in the so-called underdoped region where n <n_{0} but decreases with n when the compound is in the so-called overdoped region where n >n_{0}. It has also been demonstrated[22] that dT_{c}/dP is negative when n \congn_{0} and positive when n <n_{0}. The Sm(O/F)FeAs system seems to be similar to the high-T_{c} cuprates, although the current doping levels achieved do not reveal the expected decrease in T_{c} yet.[23] Further increase in the electron number in the FeAs layers by improved methods of doping should therefore result in a decrease in T_{c}. With this conjecture in mind, one can conclude that the x = 0.30 sample with a negative dT_{c}/dP must lie close to the overdoped region and the x = 0.13 sample with a positive dT_{c}/dP in the underdoped region. This suggests that the T_{c} of Sm(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs should peak between nominal x = 0.13 and 0.3 and within a T_{c} range of 50-60 K. Indeed, a systematic control of x in Sm(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs has just led to an enhanced T_{c} of 53 K. Furthermore, in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors REBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (REBCO), where RE=Y and rare-earth elements, RE controls the stability of the crystal structure but is electronically isolated from the superconductivity of the compound because the density of states of RE lies deep below the Fermi level.[24] Therefore, the T_{c} of REBCO has been observed to vary with n universally and the maximum T_{c} falls into the narrow range around 90 K independent of RE. Similarities between the layered structures of RE(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs and REBCO led us to conjecture that, like REBCO, RE(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs will have a similar T_{c} variation with x and a narrow maximum T_{c} range in \sim50 K for all RE provided that the ZrCuSiAs layered structure can be stabilized in spite of the great variation from 26 to 52 K of the maximum T_{c} of RE(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs reported for different RE's.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8] A systematic study on the doping effect is warranted and should yield a nonmonotonic T_{c}-x relation instead of those previously reported. To increase the maximum T_{c} of La(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs from 26 to around 50 K is a strong possibility. On the other hand, several cuprate high-T_{c} compound

  systems similar to REBCO exist with T_{c} up to 134 K at ambient pressure [25] and 164 K at 30 GPa. [26] It is not unlikely that T_{c} above 50 K will be found in a yet-to-be-discovered compound system similar to but different from REOFeAs with proper doping.

The suppression of the SDW state is clearly evidenced by the shifting of the resistance peak at T_{\rm SDW} to a lower temperature by F doping and also by the diminishing of the resistance peak near T_{\rm SDW} upon the application of pressure, in general agreement with the band calculations (Fig. 5). Questions of whether the appearance of superconductivity requires the complete disruption of the SDW gap, as many of the published results suggest, and whether a direct interaction exists between the superconducting and the SDW states remain unanswered. A systematic high-pressure study on compounds very close to the border between the superconducting and SDW states should help address these questions.

Samples used for resistivity measurements had a typical size of 3 mm length and an area of 1 mm^{2}. The resistance was measured using the standard four-lead technique. The electrical contacts were made by attaching platinum wires using silver paint. The contact resistance was on the order of a few ohms. The low-frequency (19 Hz) resistance bridge (LR700) was employed for resistivity measurements. High-pressure measurements were carried out employing the Be-Cu clamp method with the pressure determined by the Pb-pressure gauge.[20] A mixture of Fluorinert 70 and 77 liquid was used as the pressure transmitting medium.

The magnetic susceptibility of the superconducting samples was measured at ambient pressure in 5 Oe. The diamagnetic shielding signal corresponds to >30% of superconducting volume fraction for both samples. This value is reasonable in view of the nonsuperconducting impurity phases present in the samples. The resistance (R) variations with temperature in our samples are in agreement with previous reports. A R maximum at T_{\rm SDW} indicative of the onset of magnetic order (SDW) is evident in the x=0 and 0.05 nonsuperconducting samples with T_{\rm SDW} decreasing from 150 to 125 K at ambient pressure but not in the x=0.13 and 0.3 superconducting samples with an onset T_{c} increasing from \sim30 to \sim48 K (Fig. 2), consistent with the F-doping effects expected from theoretical predictions.

Under pressure, the room temperature R of the x=0.3 sample decreases rapidly with initial pressure increase and continues to decrease, but only slowly, at higher pressures during the pressure-increase cycle, perhaps due to an initial pressure-induced compaction of the sample. However, pressure reduction results in an irreversible R increase, attributed to the pressure-induced degradation of the sample. To define the superconducting T_{c} consistently, we have taken the inflection point temperature of the R-T curve or the peak temperature of the dR/dT vs T plot as our T_{c}. A T_{c} defined as such is expected to be lower than the previously reported T_{c}'s, most of which referred to the onset temperatures. The T_{c} of the x=0.3 sample is suppressed by pressure at a rate of dT_{c}/dP\sim-2.3 K/GPa (Fig. 3), in contrast to previous suggestions. It should be noted that the T_{c} of 42.5 K upon the complete release of pressure is slightly lower than the starting value, probably due to the combination effect of sample degradation and the residual pressure locked in the high-pressure cell. On the other hand, for the x=0.13 sample, T_{c} increases with pressure from 24.7 to 25.55 K at 0.94 GPa at a rate of \sim0.9 K/GPa and then stays at 25.55 K at higher pressures (Fig. 4), while the room temperature R varies with pressure as in the x=0.3 sample. The T_{c} after the complete release of pressure became higher, attributable to the sample change and the residual stress. Therefore, pressure effects on the T_{c} of the two samples examined are reversible except when the pressure is finally removed. The latter can be due to the polycrystallinity and low density of the samples, which

  raises the possibility that the release of pressure may weaken the interactions between grains. The unusual pressure dependence of T_{c} of this sample observed may be a reflection of the fine electronic structure near the Fermi surface. To study the behavior of the SDW state under pressure, we measured only the x = 0.05 nonsuperconducting sample. It is evident that the R peak is suppressed by pressure (Fig. 5). For better definition, we take T_{\rm SDW} as the peak temperature of dR/dT; the suppression of the SDW state by pressure is shown in Fig. 5.

In contrast to theoretical predictions that F doping and pressure would have the same effect in suppressing the SDW state and enhancing the superconducting state of Sm(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs,[12, 15, 19] we found that pressure can either promote or suppress the superconducting state, depending on the doping level of x, whereas pressure always suppresses the SDW state. It has been shown that the T_{c} of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors varies with carrier concentration (n) following a universal parabolic rule with T_{c} peaks at a carrier concentration n_{0}.[21]T_{c} increases with n in the so-called underdoped region where n <n_{0} but decreases with n when the compound is in the so-called overdoped region where n >n_{0}. It has also been demonstrated[22] that dT_{c}/dP is negative when n \congn_{0} and positive when n <n_{0}. The Sm(O/F)FeAs system seems to be similar to the high-T_{c} cuprates, although the current doping levels achieved do not reveal the expected decrease in T_{c} yet.[23] Further increase in the electron number in the FeAs layers by improved methods of doping should therefore result in a decrease in T_{c}. With this conjecture in mind, one can conclude that the x = 0.30 sample with a negative dT_{c}/dP must lie close to the overdoped region and the x = 0.13 sample with a positive dT_{c}/dP in the underdoped region. This suggests that the T_{c} of Sm(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs should peak between nominal x = 0.13 and 0.3 and within a T_{c} range of 50-60 K. Indeed, a systematic control of x in Sm(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs has just led to an enhanced T_{c} of 53 K. Furthermore, in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors REBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (REBCO), where RE=Y and rare-earth elements, RE controls the stability of the crystal structure but is electronically isolated from the superconductivity of the compound because the density of states of RE lies deep below the Fermi level.[24] Therefore, the T_{c} of REBCO has been observed to vary with n universally and the maximum T_{c} falls into the narrow range around 90 K independent of RE. Similarities between the layered structures of RE(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs and REBCO led us to conjecture that, like REBCO, RE(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs will have a similar T_{c} variation with x and a narrow maximum T_{c} range in \sim50 K for all RE provided that the ZrCuSiAs layered structure can be stabilized in spite of the great variation from 26 to 52 K of the maximum T_{c} of RE(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs reported for different RE's.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8] A systematic study on the doping effect is warranted and should yield a nonmonotonic T_{c}-x relation instead of those previously reported. To increase the maximum T_{c} of La(O_{1-x}F_{x})FeAs from 26 to around 50 K is a strong possibility. On the other hand, several cuprate high-T_{c} compound

  systems similar to REBCO exist with T_{c} up to 134 K at ambient pressure [25] and 164 K at 30 GPa. [26] It is not unlikely that T_{c} above 50 K will be found in a yet-to-be-discovered compound system similar to but different from REOFeAs with proper doping.

The suppression of the SDW state is clearly evidenced by the shifting of the resistance peak at T_{\rm SDW} to a lower temperature by F doping and also by the diminishing of the resistance peak near T_{\rm SDW} upon the application of pressure, in general agreement with the band calculations (Fig. 5). Questions of whether the appearance of superconductivity requires the complete disruption of the SDW gap, as many of the published results suggest, and whether a direct interaction exists between the superconducting and the SDW states remain unanswered. A systematic high-pressure study on compounds very close to the border between the superconducting and SDW states should help address these questions.
