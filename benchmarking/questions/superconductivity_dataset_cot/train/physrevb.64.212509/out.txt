###### Abstract

The transport properties of dense polycrystalline and single-crystalline MgB_{2} platelets have been measured to determine the effects of grain size on the upper critical field H_{c2} and the anisotropy parameter. The H_{c2} in polycrystalline MgB_{2} is enhanced and the magnetic-field-induced broadening is significantly reduced with increasing grain size, probably due to reduced contamination at the grain boundaries. Single-crystalline MgB_{2} exhibits remarkable anisotropy in H_{c2}(T) and irreversibility field H^{\ast}(T) with anisotropy \gamma=H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c}-3 \pm 0.2. The large broadening of the superconducting transition for the \mathbf{H}||c direction indicates a significant suppression of H^{\ast}(T) below H_{c2}^{c}, giving H^{\ast\ast}(T)\sim 0.71H_{c2}^{c}(T).

The recent discovery[1] of superconductivity in MgB_{2} with a transition temperature of about 39 K has generated extensive scientific interest for both basic and applied research. From studies of several fundamental properties, it is now apparent that MgB_{2} is a type-II superconductor with \lambda\sim 140 nm and upper critical field H_{c2}(0)\sim 16-18 T, while the irreversibility field H^{\ast} is about 0.5 H_{c2}2-8 An issue of primary importance is to what degree this superconductor is anisotropic. Since MgB_{2} consists of alternating B and Mg sheets, electronic anisotropy has been anticipated.[9] For hot-pressed samples,[10] partially oriented crystallites,[11] and c-axis-oriented thin films,[12] the upper critical field anisotropy ratio \gamma=H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c} is reported as 1.1, 1.7, and about 2, respectively. Very recently, an anisotropy ratio ranging from 1.7 to 2.7 was determined in single crystals.[13, 14, 15] However, the actual value of \gamma and its upper limit remain unresolved, the reason being the different qualities of single crystals and significant normal-state magnetoresistance. The anisotropic nature of MgB_{2} will strongly affect the irreversible properties, especially the irreversibility field H^{\ast}(T) at which the bulk supercurrent density disappears. Hence studies of the anisotropic properties of MgB_{2} in its different forms are currently of potential interest both for physics and application points of view.

The other interesting features concerning the electronic transport in the mixed state and the broadening of the superconducting transition in applied magnetic fields have drawn attention to flux pinning. On the other hand, the anomalous behavior of the Hall coefficient[16, 17, 18] raises questions related to the nature of carriers. Since MgB_{2} looks promising for applications, the influence of a moderately high anisotropy value on the electrical transport and its implications for flux pinning in bulk, thin films, and single crystals are of tremendous importance. Although weak-link phenomena seem to be much less operative in MgB_{2} compared to high-T_{c} cuprates,[4] grain size effects on various physical properties remain a nontrivial problem.

In this communication, we report on the electronic transport properties of dense polycrystalline bulk and single-crystalline MgB_{2} over a wide temperature range from 300 to 5 K. The H_{c2} is enhanced and the magnetic-field-induced broadening is significantly reduced in MgB_{2} with increasing grain size in the bulk due to reduced contamination and impurities. Single-crystalline MgB_{2} exhibits remarkable anisotropy in H_{c2}(T) and H^{\ast}(T) with \gamma=H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c}-3 \pm 0.2. The large broadening of the superconducting transition for the H||c direction indicates a significant suppression of H^{\ast}(T) below H_{c2}^{c} for the same orientation.

The highly dense (density \sim 2.63 g/cm^{3}) MgB_{2} bulk samples (MgB_{2} No. 1 and MgB_{2} No. 2) were synthesized under high pressure (3.5 GPa) at high temperature (1000 ^{\circ}C) in BN crucible as described earlier.[5] Higher-purity starting materials were used for the synthesis of MgB_{2} samples (MgB_{2} No. 2) and the details will be published elsewhere.[19] X-ray diffraction reveals that the sample is single phase. The high-resolution polarizing microscope reveals grains of size 1-5 \mum in MgB_{2} No. 1, whereas 50-200 \mum long grains were seen in MgB_{2} No. 2. Magnetization and micro-Hall-probe measurements show a superconducting transition T_{c} between 37.5 and 38.2 with \Delta T_{c}<1 K. Shiny golden-yellow-colored single-crystalline MgB_{2} platelet samples of dimensions 250\times 100\times40 \mum^{3} were extracted from MgB_{2} No. 2 for transport measurements. The resistively measured T_{c} was found to be at \sim 38.2 K with \Delta T_{c}\sim0.3 K. Field-dependent resistivity was measured using a standard four-probe ac technique (f= 16 Hz). Current-voltage (_1-V_) measurements were performed by the dc method with the current reversal technique.

  First, we discuss the behavior of field-induced resistive transitions in MgB_{2} No. 1 and No. 2. In Fig. 1 we present the resistive superconducting transition in MgB_{2} No. 1 and MgB_{2} No. 2 under both perpendicular (solid lines) and parallel (dashed lines) magnetic fields, both perpendicular to the current flow, up to 9 T. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity \rho of MgB_{2} No. 1, shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a), roughly obeys the power law \rho = \rho_{0} + \rho_{1}T^{a} with \alpha\sim 1.9, in the normal state. Similar behavior with \alpha\sim 2.1 was found in MgB_{2} No. 2. The resistivity \rho(40 K) \sim 41.7 \mu\Omega cm in MgB_{2} No. 1 is reduced to \sim32.1 \mu\Omega cm for MgB_{2} No. 2. The magnetotransport results show two significant differences between two types of samples. In MgB_{2} No. 1, there is a large broadening in resistivity under magnetic field with a pronounced tail feature, indicating a considerable flux-flow phenomenon observed in sintered MgB_{2} bulk.[2] This behavior is strongly reduced in MgB_{2} No. 2, as a consequence, both H_{c2} and H* are enhanced. Note that the magnetic critical current density in MgB_{2} No. 2 is enhanced by an order of magnitude (\sim1 \times 10^{4} A/cm^{2}) at 5 K in a field of 5 T compared to that of MgB_{2} No. 1. Although weak links are the primary suspects of such a large resistive broadening, contamination due to foreign atoms might play a major role. No significant anisotropy was observed in both samples as shown in Fig. 1 for two field orientations, which is consistent with a random orientation of each grain in the polycrystalline pellets.

In the inset of Fig. 1(b), we show the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_{H} of MgB_{2} No. 2, calculated under magnetic field reversal (H = \pm 5 T) at a given temperature. R_{H} is positive over the whole temperature range and is weakly temperature dependent. R_{H} shows a peak around T_{c} before going to zero without any sign change anomaly. This is consistent with the recent report on thin film [17] rather than that for a polycrystalline sample.[16] The estimated hole carrier density \sim 1.84\times10^{23} holes/cm^{3} at 300 K is rather high and needs its explanation using a two-band model; however, it is consistent with the low resistivity observed in MgB_{2}. We estimate the mean free path at the lowest temperature l = 90 nm from l = 3\left[\rho N(0)\upsilon_{F}e^{2}\right], where \rho is the residual resistivity, N(0) is the density of states at the Fermi level, \upsilon_{F} is the Fermi velocity, and e is the elementary charge. Here we used N(0) = 0.7 states/(eV cell) from specific heat measurement,[20] and \upsilon_{F} = 4.8\times10^{7} cm/sec from band structure calculations.[21] The coherence length without impurity is given by \xi_{0}\sim 0.18\hbar\upsilon_{F}/k_{B}T_{c} and is estimated as 17 nm. With these estimations, we can safely claim that our MgB_{2} single crystal is in the clean limit l/\xi_{0}>1.

Figure 2 shows the main results of this paper. The temperature-dependent resistivity curves are shown for fixed field values applied in both the (a) **H\left|\left|c\right.\right.** and (b) **H\left|\left|ab\right.\right.** planes of the MgB_{2} single-crystalline sample. The estimated resistivity ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(40 K) is \sim5.5 with \rho(40 K) \sim 1.8 \mu\Omega cm. This value is much smaller than our polycrystalline samples, but similar to the results on single crystals.[13, 14, 15] The temperature dependence of the resistivity in zero field shown as an inset in Fig. 2(b) roughly obeys a \rho = \rho_{0} + \rho_{1}T^{a} power law with \alpha\sim3 in the normal state and is consistent with a previous report.[2] A sharp T_{c} at \sim 38.2 K with \Delta T_{c}<0.3 K indicates the high quality and homogeneity of the crystal. Although T_{c} of the present crystal is slightly lower than that of bulk[1] and wires,[9] it is very similar

The inset in (a) shows the temperature dependence of the normal-state resistivity of MgB_{2} No. 1 for H = 0 T. The inset in (b) shows the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient of MgB_{2} No. 2.

  to single-crystal results.[13, 14, 15] The origin of a lower T_{c} in single crystals may be related to unavoidable contamination by impurities from the BN (Refs. [5] and [15]) containers, when using cubic anvil and Mo (Ref. [13]) or Nb (Ref. [14]) in other cases. The resistive transition under magnetic field for **H**||c is significantly suppressed compared to that for **H**||ab. In addition, the significant broadening of the transition for **H**||c causes a large suppression of H^{\ast\varepsilon}. Interestingly, the transition remains very sharp for the **H**||ab plane, indicating a moderately large upper critical field anisotropy in the system. Figure 3 shows in detail the resistively determined H_{c2}(T) and H^{\ast}(T) lines for dense pellets and single-crystalline MgB_{2} samples. H^{\ast}(T) defined with a criterion of \rho = 0.01 \mu\Omega cm is shown in Fig. 2(a) as arrows. Thus determined H^{\ast}(T) roughly coincides with that determined from magnetic measurements with a critical current criterion of J_{c} = 100 A/cm^{2}.

It is clear that both H_{c2}(T) and H^{\ast}(T) in MgB_{2} No. 2 are higher than that of MgB_{2} No. 1. The suppression of H^{\ast}(T) is remarkably smaller in MgB_{2} No. 2, indicating reduced flux flow and weaker vortex fluctuations. In MgB_{2} No. 2, H^{\ast} occurs at H^{\ast}(T) \sim 0.72H_{c2}(T) which is larger than that of 0.66 estimated for MgB_{2} No. 1. The higher H_{c2} values obtained in MgB_{2} No. 2 can have several reasons. Consider a sample of randomly oriented grains of a uniaxial superconductor with anisotropy \gamma = H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c} placed in a field along z. The distribution of grains over their c direction is given by dN = N sin \thetad\theta2 with \theta being the angle between the c axis and the applied field H. It is certain that the upper critical field of the grains depends on \theta according to[22]H_{c2}(\theta) =H_{c2}^{ab}/\epsilon(\theta)^{1/2} with \epsilon(\theta)  =H_{c2}^{ab}/F_{c2}^{c}\sim3 +- 0.2, which is larger than the reported values, 11-15 but smaller than the estimation by CESR, 22\gamma = 6-9. A significant suppression of the irreversibility field H^{*} occurs for **H\parallelc**, giving H^{*\varepsilon}(T)\sim 0.71H_{c2}^{c}(T), which is larger than that of the recent report[52] of H^{*\varepsilon}(T)\sim 0.5H_{c2}^{c}(T). This is mainly due to the single resistive transition observed in the present crystal for **H\parallelc**. By contrast, for **H\parallel\midab** we found H^{*ab}(T)\sim 0.91H_{c2}^{ab}(T). The H^{*\varepsilon}(T) is also suppressed in comparison to the H_{irr} determined magnetically in a sintered sample. 2 We evaluated dH_{c2}^{c}(T)/dT\sim - 0.17 T/K and dH_{c2}^{ab}(T)/dT\sim - 0.55 T/K in the higher-field region in order to avoid the region of small positive curvature at low fields and to exclude any contribution from the minority phase. In addition, we mention that a small positive curvature in H_{c2} near T_{c} may also support that MgB_{2} is a clean-limit superconductor like intermetallic borocarbides. 24 Assuming the extrapolation formula for an isotropic s-wave superconductor, 9H_{c2}(0) = 0.73T_{c}[ - dH_{c2}(T)/dT], we estimated H_{c2}^{c}(0) \sim 4.8 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) \sim 15 T, giving \gamma\sim 3.2. The simple extrapolation of H_{c2}^{c} and H_{c2}^{ab} lines to the zero-temperature axis yields H_{c2}^{c}(0) \sim 6.5 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) \sim 20.5 T. Using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations H_{c2}^{c}(0) = \Phi_{0}/(2 \pi\xi_{ab}^{2}) and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) = \Phi_{0}/(2 \pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}), the GL coherence lengths \xi_{c}(0) and \xi_{ab}(0) are estimated to be \sim 2.7 nm for **H\parallel\midc** and \sim 8.2 nm for **H\parallel\midab**. Hence, we can conclude that MgB_{2} shows a moderate anisotropy that is between intermetallic borocarbides (\sim 1.13) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}(\sim 6).

Footnote 2: H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 0.55 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 20.5 T.

Footnote 3: H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 0.55 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 20.5 T.

Footnote 5: H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 0.55 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 20.5 T.

Finally, in Fig. 4 we present the isothermal _I-V_ curves for (a) MgB_{2} No. 2 at H = 5 T and (b) single-crystalline MgB_{2} at H = 2 T applied parallel to the ab plane. MgB_{2} No. 2 shows _I-V_ curves similar to the recent report on MgB_{2} films 25 and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, and can be consistently explained using vortex-glass theory. 26 However, a scaling analysis of the vortex state is beyond the scope of the present paper. In Fig. 4(b) we show a remarkably different behavior of _I-V_ curves in single-crystalline MgB_{2} for **H\parallelab**. The sudden change of the curvature may indicate a first-order-like vortex-lattice melting transition for this field orientation. The temperature dependence of d\rho/dT for **H\parallelab** at 2 T shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b) exhibits a sharp peak, suggesting the phenomenon of melting. The transition becomes broader for higher fields possibly due to the dominant effect of disorder. The transition was found to be very weakly current dependent. It is worth mentioning that a similar sudden change of slope is observed in the same crystal in low fields, _H_<1 T, for the **H\parallelc** direction. This is consistent with the vortex-lattice melting transitions generally observed in untwined YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} crystals. 27. However, further thermodynamic evidence is necessary to support this claim.

Footnote 2: H_{c2}^{c}(0)\sim 0.55 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 20.5 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 20.5 T. Using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations H_{c2}^{c}(0) = \Phi_{0}/(2 \pi\xi_{ab}^{2}) and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) = \Phi_{0}/(2 \pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}), the GL coherence lengths \xi_{c}(0) and \xi_{ab}(0) are estimated to be \sim 2.7 nm for **H\parallel\midc** and \sim 8.2 nm for **H\parallel\midab**. Hence, we can conclude that MgB_{2} shows a moderate anisotropy that is between intermetallic borocarbides (\sim 1.13) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}(\sim 6).

Finally, in Fig. 4 we present the isothermal _I-V_ curves for (a) MgB_{2} No. 2 at H = 5 T and (b) single-crystalline MgB_{2} at H = 2 T applied parallel to the ab plane.

However, further thermodynamic evidence is necessary to support this claim.

Footnote 3: H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 0.55 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 20.5 T.

Footnote 4: H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 0.55 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 20.5 T.

Footnote 5: H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 0.55 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\sim 20.5 T.

In summary, our transport results show that H_{c2} is enhanced and the magnetic-field-induced broadening is significantly reduced in the large-grain polycrystalline bulk MgB_{2} sample. Single-crystalline MgB_{2} exhibits remarkable anisotropy in H_{c2}(T) and H^{*}(T) with \gamma=H_{c2}^{ab}H_{c2}^{c}\sim 3 +- 0.2. The large broadening of the superconducting transition for **H\parallel\midc** direction indicates a significant suppression of H^{*}(T) below H_{c2}^{c} for the same orientation. The sharp resistive transition and the sudden change of slope in _I-V_ curves indicate the possibility of a first-order vortex-lattice melting like transition. These results could be very important to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in MgB_{2} and useful for technological advances.

The highly dense (density \sim 2.63 g/cm^{3}) MgB_{2} bulk samples (MgB_{2} No. 1 and MgB_{2} No. 2) were synthesized under high pressure (3.5 GPa) at high temperature (1000 ^{\circ}C) in BN crucible as described earlier.[5] Higher-purity starting materials were used for the synthesis of MgB_{2} samples (MgB_{2} No. 2) and the details will be published elsewhere.[19] X-ray diffraction reveals that the sample is single phase.

  First, we discuss the behavior of field-induced resistive transitions in MgB_{2} No. 1 and No. 2. In Fig. 1 we present the resistive superconducting transition in MgB_{2} No. 1 and MgB_{2} No. 2 under both perpendicular (solid lines) and parallel (dashed lines) magnetic fields, both perpendicular to the current flow, up to 9 T. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity \rho of MgB_{2} No. 1, shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a), roughly obeys the power law \rho = \rho_{0} + \rho_{1}T^{a} with \alpha\sim 1.9, in the normal state. Similar behavior with \alpha\sim 2.1 was found in MgB_{2} No. 2. The resistivity \rho(40 K) \sim 41.7 \mu\Omega cm in MgB_{2} No. 1 is reduced to \sim32.1 \mu\Omega cm for MgB_{2} No. 2. The magnetotransport results show two significant differences between two types of samples. In MgB_{2} No. 1, there is a large broadening in resistivity under magnetic field with a pronounced tail feature, indicating a considerable flux-flow phenomenon observed in sintered MgB_{2} bulk.[2] This behavior is strongly reduced in MgB_{2} No. 2, as a consequence, both H_{c2} and H* are enhanced. Note that the magnetic critical current density in MgB_{2} No. 2 is enhanced by an order of magnitude (\sim1 \times 10^{4} A/cm^{2}) at 5 K in a field of 5 T compared to that of MgB_{2} No. 1. Although weak links are the primary suspects of such a large resistive broadening, contamination due to foreign atoms might play a major role. No significant anisotropy was observed in both samples as shown in Fig. 1 for two field orientations, which is consistent with a random orientation of each grain in the polycrystalline pellets.

In the inset of Fig. 1(b), we show the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_{H} of MgB_{2} No. 2, calculated under magnetic field reversal (H = \pm 5 T) at a given temperature. R_{H} is positive over the whole temperature range and is weakly temperature dependent. R_{H} shows a peak around T_{c} before going to zero without any sign change anomaly. This is consistent with the recent report on thin film [17] rather than that for a polycrystalline sample.[16] The estimated hole carrier density \sim 1.84\times10^{23} holes/cm^{3} at 300 K is rather high and needs its explanation using a two-band model; however, it is consistent with the low resistivity observed in MgB_{2}. We estimate the mean free path at the lowest temperature l = 90 nm from l = 3\left[\rho N(0)\upsilon_{F}e^{2}\right], where \rho is the residual resistivity, N(0) is the density of states at the Fermi level, \upsilon_{F} is the Fermi velocity, and e is the elementary charge. Here we used N(0) = 0.7 states/(eV cell) from specific heat measurement,[20] and \upsilon_{F} = 4.8\times10^{7} cm/sec from band structure calculations.[21] The coherence length without impurity is given by \xi_{0}\sim 0.18\hbar\upsilon_{F}/k_{B}T_{c} and is estimated as 17 nm. With these estimations, we can safely claim that our MgB_{2} single crystal is in the clean limit l/\xi_{0}>1.

Figure 2 shows the main results of this paper. The temperature-dependent resistivity curves are shown for fixed field values applied in both the (a) **H\left|\left|c\right.\right.** and (b) **H\left|\left|ab\right.\right.** planes of the MgB_{2} single-crystalline sample. The estimated resistivity ratio \rho(300 K)/\rho(40 K) is \sim5.5 with \rho(40 K) \sim 1.8 \mu\Omega cm. This value is much smaller than our polycrystalline samples, but similar to the results on single crystals.[13, 14, 15] The temperature dependence of the resistivity in zero field shown as an inset in Fig. 2(b) roughly obeys a \rho = \rho_{0} + \rho_{1}T^{a} power law with \alpha\sim3 in the normal state and is consistent with a previous report.[2] A sharp T_{c} at \sim 38.2 K with \Delta T_{c}<0.3 K indicates the high quality and homogeneity of the crystal. Although T_{c} of the present crystal is slightly lower than that of bulk[1] and wires,[9] it is very similar

  to single-crystal results.[13, 14, 15] The origin of a lower T_{c} in single crystals may be related to unavoidable contamination by impurities from the BN (Refs. [5] and [15]) containers, when using cubic anvil and Mo (Ref. [13]) or Nb (Ref. [14]) in other cases. The resistive transition under magnetic field for **H**||c is significantly suppressed compared to that for **H**||ab. In addition, the significant broadening of the transition for **H**||c causes a large suppression of H^{\ast\varepsilon}. Interestingly, the transition remains very sharp for the **H**||ab plane, indicating a moderately large upper critical field anisotropy in the system. Figure 3 shows in detail the resistively determined H_{c2}(T) and H^{\ast}(T) lines for dense pellets and single-crystalline MgB_{2} samples. H^{\ast}(T) defined with a criterion of \rho = 0.01 \mu\Omega cm is shown in Fig. 2(a) as arrows. Thus determined H^{\ast}(T) roughly coincides with that determined from magnetic measurements with a critical current criterion of J_{c} = 100 A/cm^{2}.

It is clear that both H_{c2}(T) and H^{\ast}(T) in MgB_{2} No. 2 are higher than that of MgB_{2} No. 1. The suppression of H^{\ast}(T) is remarkably smaller in MgB_{2} No. 2, indicating reduced flux flow and weaker vortex fluctuations. In MgB_{2} No. 2, H^{\ast} occurs at H^{\ast}(T) \sim 0.72H_{c2}(T) which is larger than that of 0.66 estimated for MgB_{2} No. 1. The higher H_{c2} values obtained in MgB_{2} No. 2 can have several reasons. Consider a sample of randomly oriented grains of a uniaxial superconductor with anisotropy \gamma = H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c} placed in a field along z. The distribution of grains over their c direction is given by dN = N sin \thetad\theta2 with \theta being the angle between the c axis and the applied field H. It is certain that the upper critical field of the grains depends on \theta according to[22]H_{c2}(\theta) =H_{c2}^{ab}/\epsilon(\theta)^{1/2} with \epsilon(\theta)  =H_{c2}^{ab}/F_{c2}^{c}\sim3 +- 0.2, which is larger than the reported values, 11-15 but smaller than the estimation by CESR, 22\gamma = 6-9. A significant suppression of the irreversibility field H^{*} occurs for **H\parallelc**, giving H^{*\varepsilon}(T)\sim 0.71H_{c2}^{c}(T), which is larger than that of the recent report[52] of H^{*\varepsilon}(T)\sim 0.5H_{c2}^{c}(T). This is mainly due to the single resistive transition observed in the present crystal for **H\parallelc**. By contrast, for **H\parallel\midab** we found H^{*ab}(T)\sim 0.91H_{c2}^{ab}(T). The H^{*\varepsilon}(T) is also suppressed in comparison to the H_{irr} determined magnetically in a sintered sample. 2 We evaluated dH_{c2}^{c}(T)/dT\sim - 0.17 T/K and dH_{c2}^{ab}(T)/dT\sim - 0.55 T/K in the higher-field region in order to avoid the region of small positive curvature at low fields and to exclude any contribution from the minority phase. In addition, we mention that a small positive curvature in H_{c2} near T_{c} may also support that MgB_{2} is a clean-limit superconductor like intermetallic borocarbides. 24 Assuming the extrapolation formula for an isotropic s-wave superconductor, 9H_{c2}(0) = 0.73T_{c}[ - dH_{c2}(T)/dT], we estimated H_{c2}^{c}(0) \sim 4.8 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) \sim 15 T, giving \gamma\sim 3.2. The simple extrapolation of H_{c2}^{c} and H_{c2}^{ab} lines to the zero-temperature axis yields H_{c2}^{c}(0) \sim 6.5 T and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) \sim 20.5 T. Using the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations H_{c2}^{c}(0) = \Phi_{0}/(2 \pi\xi_{ab}^{2}) and H_{c2}^{ab}(0) = \Phi_{0}/(2 \pi\xi_{ab}\xi_{c}), the GL coherence lengths \xi_{c}(0) and \xi_{ab}(0) are estimated to be \sim 2.7 nm for **H\parallel\midc** and \sim 8.2 nm for **H\parallel\midab**. Hence, we can conclude that MgB_{2} shows a moderate anisotropy that is between intermetallic borocarbides (\sim 1.13) and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}(\sim 6).

Finally, in Fig. 4 we present the isothermal _I-V_ curves for (a) MgB_{2} No. 2 at H = 5 T and (b) single-crystalline MgB_{2} at H = 2 T applied parallel to the ab plane. MgB_{2} No. 2 shows _I-V_ curves similar to the recent report on MgB_{2} films 25 and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, and can be consistently explained using vortex-glass theory. 26 However, a scaling analysis of the vortex state is beyond the scope of the present paper. In Fig. 4(b) we show a remarkably different behavior of _I-V_ curves in single-crystalline MgB_{2} for **H\parallelab**. The sudden change of the curvature may indicate a first-order-like vortex-lattice melting transition for this field orientation. The temperature dependence of d\rho/dT for **H\parallelab** at 2 T shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b) exhibits a sharp peak, suggesting the phenomenon of melting. The transition becomes broader for higher fields possibly due to the dominant effect of disorder. The transition was found to be very weakly current dependent. It is worth mentioning that a similar sudden change of slope is observed in the same crystal in low fields, _H_<1 T, for the **H\parallelc** direction. This is consistent with the vortex-lattice melting transitions generally observed in untwined YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} crystals. 27. However, further thermodynamic evidence is necessary to support this claim.

In summary, our transport results show that H_{c2} is enhanced and the magnetic-field-induced broadening is significantly reduced in the large-grain polycrystalline bulk MgB_{2} sample. Single-crystalline MgB_{2} exhibits remarkable anisotropy in H_{c2}(T) and H^{*}(T) with \gamma=H_{c2}^{ab}H_{c2}^{c}\sim 3 +- 0.2. The large broadening of the superconducting transition for **H\parallel\midc** direction indicates a significant suppression of H^{*}(T) below H_{c2}^{c} for the same orientation. The sharp resistive transition and the sudden change of slope in _I-V_ curves indicate the possibility of a first-order vortex-lattice melting like transition. These results could be very important to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in MgB_{2} and useful for technological advances.
