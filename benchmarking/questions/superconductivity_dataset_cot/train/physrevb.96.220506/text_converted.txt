###### Abstract

The superconductor PdTe₂ was recently classified as a type-II Dirac
semimetal, and advocated to be an improved platform for topological
superconductivity. Here, we report magnetic and transport measurements
conducted to determine the nature of the superconducting phase.
Surprisingly, we find that PdTe₂ is a type-I superconductor with T_(c) =
1.64 K and a critical field μ₀H_(c)(0) = 13.6 mT. Our crystals also
exhibit the intermediate state as demonstrated by the differential
paramagnetic effect. For H > H_(c) we observe superconductivity of the
surface sheath. This calls for a close examination of superconductivity
in PdTe₂ in view of the presence of topological surface states.

Recently, the transition metal dichalcogenide PdTe₂ was reported to be a
type-II Dirac semimetal [1, 2, 3]. Topological Dirac semimetals form a
new class of topological materials, where nontrivial surface states
arise due to the topology of the bulk band structure (for recent
reviews, see Refs. [4, 5, 6]). Dirac semimetals are the
three-dimensional (3D) analog of graphene and have a cone-shaped linear
energy dispersion around the Dirac point with massless fermions [7]. The
bands have a double degeneracy that can be lifted by a magnetic field
resulting in a pair of Weyl cones. In the closely related class of Weyl
semimetals, the degeneracy is naturally lifted by breaking time reversal
and/or inversion symmetry [8]. The set of Weyl cones can give rise to
distinct properties, such as Fermi arcs at the surface, a quantum
anomalous Hall effect, and chiral magnetotransport [5, 6]. Type-I Dirac
semimetals are similar to graphene and the valence and conduction bands
meet at the Dirac point and Lorentz invariance is obeyed. In type-II
Dirac semimetals an extra momentum-dependent term in the Hamiltonian
breaks Lorentz invariance [9, 10, 11]. This can be accomplished by
tilting the Dirac cone, where the Dirac point is now the touching point
of the electron and hole pockets. This gives rise to a number of new
physical phenomena, such as an angle-dependent chiral anomaly and
topological Lifshitz transitions [5, 6].

Superconductivity in PdTe₂ with a transition temperature T_(c) of 1.5 K
was discovered in 1961 [12]. The recent detection of topological
features in the band structure raises the question whether
superconductivity has also a topological nature [1, 2, 13]. Notably, it
has been advocated that PdTe₂ is an improved platform for topological
superconductivity [2]. Topological superconductors attract much
attention because they are predicted to host protected Majorana zero
modes at their surface (for recent reviews, see Refs. [14, 15]). This
offers a unique design route to produce future devices for topological
quantum computation. Unfortunately, the number of materials in which
topological superconductivity has been realized - or is under debate -
is very small [15]. Majorana modes, which appear as gapless nodes in the
bulk superconducting gap, are in general not stable in a type-I Dirac
semimetal [15]. However, in a type-II semimetal the situation is
different because of the tilted dispersion. Moreover, the abundance of
states in the electron and hole pockets near the type-II Dirac point
favors a larger carrier concentration and superconductivity [2].

Hitherto, the superconducting state of PdTe₂ has yet to be studied in
detail. The early determination of T_(c) by Guggenheim _et al._[12] was
confirmed by others with T_(c) values ranging from 1.7 to 2.0 K [2, 16,
17, 18]. Fei _et al._[2] investigated the depression of T_(c) in
magnetic field and reported an anomalous upward curvature of the upper
critical field H_(c2)(T) with μ₀H_(c2) = 0.32 T for T → 0. In view of
the proposed topological nature of the superconducting state [1, 2, 13],
an in-depth characterization of the superconducting phase is a matter of
great urgency. Here, we report magnetic and transport measurements on
single crystals that unambiguously show PdTe₂ is a type-I
superconductor. This makes PdTe₂ a topological material where
superconductivity is of type I. This is a surprising result, also
because the number of known binary and ternary systems with type-I
superconductivity is very small (see, for instance, Refs. [19, 20, 21]
and references therein). Our crystals also show enhanced
superconductivity of the surface sheath in fields exceeding the critical
field H_(c). The surface superconductivity does not obey the standard
Saint-James-de Gennes behavior with critical field H_(c3) = 2.39
×κH_(c)[22, 23]. We discuss these unusual results in view of the
presence of topological surface states [1, 13].

PdTe₂ crystallizes in the trigonal CdI₂ structure (space group
$P\bar{3}m1$) [24]. It belongs to the family of transition metal
dichalcogenides, which is intensively studied because of the remarkable
physical properties [25]. Its normal-state electronic properties have
been investigated in the 1970’s by quantum oscillation experiments and
band-structure calculations [26, 27, 28]. The topological nature of the
electronic band structure was reported recently [1, 2, 13]. Notably,
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with _ab
initio_ band-structure calculations revealed PdTe₂ is a type-II Dirac
semimetal [1], which finds further support in a nontrivial Berry phase
originating from a hole pocket formed by a tilted Dirac cone [2]. The
fundamental electronic properties of PdTe₂ were revisited recently by
transport, magnetic, and thermal measurements [29].

For our study of the superconducting properties of PdTe₂ we prepared a
single crystal by a modified Bridgman tech nique [30]. Powder x-ray
diffraction confirmed the CdI₂ structure. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy showed the proper
1:2 stoichiometry within the experimental resolution of 0.5

In Fig. 1 we show the dc magnetization as a function of the applied
field H_(a) in the temperature range 0.31-1.50 K. The M(H_(a)) curves
follow the behavior of a type-I superconductor with a Meissner phase up
to μ₀H_(a) = 12 mT and the intermediate state for 12 mT
 < μ₀H_(a) < μ₀H_(c) = 13.6 mT, where H_(c) is the critical field. The
large value of the measured initial slope
χ_(m) = dM/dH_(a) = χ(1 + Nχ) = −1.13 is in agreement with bulk
superconductivity. Here, N is the demagnetization factor and χ = −1 the
ideal susceptibility [32]. From the initial slope we calculate N = 0.12,
which is close to the estimated value ∼0.10 based on the sample shape
(see SM [31]). We remark the rounding of the curves is due to the
nonuniform magnetization at the sample edges. However, a clear kink and
tail is observed in the data just above H_(c) (see inset). We will
return to this point later. We have determined H_(c)(T) by extrapolating
the idealized linear M(H_(a)) curves to M = 0, as shown by the
dashed-dotted line for T = 0.31 K in Fig. 1. The critical field follows
the standard BCS quadratic temperature variation
H_(c)(T) = H_(c)(0)[1 − (T/T_(c))²], with μ₀H_(c) = 13.6 mT and
T_(c) = 1.64 K (see Fig. 4).

The temperature variation of the dc susceptibility χ_(dc)(T) in applied
fields ≤10 mT is shown in Fig. 2. The data are taken after cooling in
zero field (ZFC) and field cooled (FC). The FC data at low applied dc
fields (μ₀H_(a) = 1 mT) demonstrate a large Meissner effect with a flux
expansion of 93

The dc magnetization, the ac susceptibility with DPE, and the extracted
T² variation of H_(c) all provide solid evidence that PdTe₂ is a type-I
superconductor. This tells us the Ginzburg-Landau parameter
$\kappa=\lambda/g<1/\sqrt{2}$. An estimate for the magnetic penetration
depth λ can be obtained using the London equation
λ = (m^(*)/μ₀n_(s)e²)^(1/2), where m^(*) is the effective mass, n_(s)
the superfluid density, and g the elementary charge. With a carrier
density n = 5.5 × 10²⁷ m⁻³ determined by Hall effect

cooled (FC) as shown by the arrows. Inset: Part of the ZFC-FC curves in

(left), as indicated. The initial slope χ_(m) = dM/dH_(a) accounts for a
superconducting sample volume of 100

measurements on our crystals, and m^(*) ≈ 0.3m_(e)[18, 27] (here, we use
an average value m^(*) and m_(e) is the free-electron mass), we
calculate λ ≈ 93 nm. A value for the superconducting coherence length ξ
can be derived from the Ginzburg-Landau relation
$\xi=\Phi_{0}/(2\sqrt{2}\pi\mu_{0}H_{c}\lambda)$[34], where Φ₀ is the
flux quantum. With the measured value H_(c)(0) = 13.6 mT, we obtain
ξ ≈ 114 nm, and calculate κ ≈ 0.34. We remark that realistic error
margins in the values of n and m^(*) will not affect the result
$\kappa<1/\sqrt{2}$. A value for κ ≤ 0.42 is further supported by the
observation of supercooling (see Fig. S7(a) in SM [31]). Supercooling is
predicted to occur for κ ≤ 0.42, and is manifest in magnetization
measurements in decreasing fields, where the sample remains in the
normal state below H_(c)[23, 34]. Since −μ₀H_(c)²/2 is the condensation
energy per unit volume, we can use thermodynamic relations to calculate
H_(c) from the step size of the specific heat at T_(c) using the
relation ΔC_(∥) = 4μ₀H_(c)(0)²/T_(c) = 1.43 × γT_(c)[32], assuming PdTe₂
is a weak-coupling BCS superconductor [35]. Here, γ is the Sommerfeld
coefficient. With the experimental value γ = 138 J/K² m³[29, 35] (the
molar volume is 4.34 × 10⁻⁵ m³/mol), we calculate μ₀H_(c)(0) = 12.6 mT,
which is close to the measured value reported in Fig. 4.

Having established that PdTe₂ is a bulk type-1 superconductor, we next
turn to superconductivity of the surface sheath. A close inspection of
the M(H) isotherms reported in Fig. 1 reveals a clear kink in the data
close to H_(c) and a long tail for M(H) → 0 (see the inset). Thus
superconductivity survives above H_(c). This is also most clearly
observed in the ac susceptibility data measured in a small driving field
μ₀H_(ac) = 0.0005 mT reported in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). For small fields
(μ₀H_(c) ≤ 4 mT) the χ_(ac)^(′′)(T) data [Fig. 3(c)] show the same
behavior as reported in Fig. 3(a) (μ₀H_(ac) = 0.25 mT). However, for
μ₀H_(c) ≥ 6 mT, the DPE peak progressively reduces and screening
persists even for fields exceeding H_(c). The χ_(ac)^(′)(H_(a)) data
[Fig. 3(d)] show that at the lowest temperature (0.31 K) screening of
the full superconducting volume takes place until ∼17 mT. By further
increasing H_(a) the screened volume is reduced in a stepwise fashion,
until finally at 33 mT the diamagnetic signal disappears completely.
Since the χ_(ac)^(′′)(T, H_(a)) data show a full screening signal above
H_(c), this signal must come from the superconducting surface layer.
This also explains why the large peak due to the DPE located just below
H_(c) becomes smaller and smaller with increasing applied field [Fig.
3(c)] or decreasing temperature [Fig. 3(d)]: The bulk is screened by the
surface layer [36]. The screening efficacy of the surface layer strongly
depends on the amplitude of H_(ac) (see SM [31]). In Fig. 3(a),
μ₀H_(ac) = 0.25 mT and the screening is weak, while in Fig. 3(b),
μ₀H_(ac) = 0.0005 mT and the screening is large. It tells us flux
pinning in the surface sheath is extremely weak and can be overcome by a
driving field of typically 0.25 mT.

Next, we present the superconducting phase diagram derived from the
magnetic and transport measurements (Fig. 4). Superconductivity of the
bulk is found below the H_(c) phase line. The critical field of the
surface layer H_(c)^(′)(T) is identified from the data in Figs. 3(c) and
3(d) by the field ( > H_(c)) at which χ_(ac)^(′′)(H) or χ_(ac)^(′′)(T)
reaches zero. We remark that for the small amplitude ac field,
μ₀H_(ac) = 0.0005 mT, H_(c)^(′′)(T) is well defined due to the steplike
feature when χ_(ac)^(′) → 0. For larger amplitudes of H_(ac), the step
broadens (see SM [31]). Theory predicts that for a type-1 superconductor
with κ > 0.42 the critical field

and out-of-phase component of the ac susceptibility for an ac driving
field μ₀H_(ac) = 0.25 mT. Data are taken in dc fields μ₀H_(ac) = 0.10
mT, as indicated. The large peaks in χ_(ac)^(′) when a dc field is
applied are due to the differential paramagnetic effect. Lower panels:

for surface superconductivity is given by H_(c3) = 2.39 × κ H_(c), while
for κ ≤ 0.42 the result is H_(c3) < H_(c)[22, 23]. For PdTe₂ we
calculate κ = 0.34, thus H_(c3) should be absent. This implies
H_(c)^(s)(T) cannot be attributed to the standard Saint-James-de Gennes
surface critical field for a type-1 superconductor. The extrapolation of
H_(c)^(s)(T) to H → 0 reveals T_(c)^(s) of the surface layer is 1.33 K,
which is lower than the bulk T_(c) (see Fig. 4). Here, we fitted
H_(c)^(s)(T) to a quadratic temperature function, from which we infer
μ₀H_(c)^(s)(0) = 34.9 mT. Remarkably, electrical resistance measurements
for H_(a) ∥ a on the same PdTe₂ crystal reveal superconductivity
survives up to fields that are almost a factor of 10 higher (see the
right panel in Fig. 4 and SM [31] for details). The critical field
determined by transport H_(c)^(R)(T) tracks the H_(c)(T) curve for low
fields (see SM [31]), but increases rapidly below ∼1.3 K. This
temperature coincides, within the error bar, with T_(c)^(s), which
strongly suggests the transport experiment probes superconductivity of
the surface layer as well. The H_(c)^(R)(T) curve compares quite well
with the standard Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression for a
weak-coupling spin-singlet superconductor in the clean limit [37] (see
SM [31]).

The phase diagram with type-I superconductivity below T_(c) = 1.64 K and
surface superconductivity below T_(c)^(s) = 1.33 K is at odds with the
standard BCS behavior, but we stress it is a robust property of our
PdTe₂ crystals. We have performed a number of checks. First of all, SEM
and EDX showed our crystals to have a homogeneous 1:2 composition and no
foreign phases were detected (see SM [31]). Second, and most important,
after taking the M and $\chi_{\rm ac}^{s}$ data we carefully polished
the surfaces of the crystal and remeasured the magnetic properties with
essentially the same results for the bulk and surface (see SM [31]).
This provides compelling evidence that surface superconductivity is not
due to an impurity phase on the surface. We emphasize the large critical
field H_(c)^(R)(T) measured by resistance is a robust property of our
crystals as well. Resistance measurements for B ∥ a^(*) and c axis on
the same crystal, as well as on other crystals, all show similarly
enhanced values of H_(c)^(R)(T) (see SM [31]). The close to isotropic
behavior for B ∥ a, a^(*), and c axis indicates the superconducting
transition in resistance is not due to filamentary superconductivity
(see SM [31]). Finally, we remark that Fei _et al._[2] reported a large
critical field ∼0.32 T for T → 0 deduced from resistance data, too.

The unusual superconducting phase diagram of PdTe₂ shows some
similarities with the diagrams reported for the type-I superconductors
LaRhSi₃[21] and AuBe [38]. For these materials also a surface critical
field much larger than H_(c) is found. However, in both cases it was
attributed to a field-induced change from type-I to type-II/1
superconductivity below a conversion temperature T^(*) < T_(c), which is
possible when κ is close to $1/\sqrt{2}$[39]. On the other hand, both
LaRhSi₃ and AuBe have a noncentrosymmetric crystal structure. Theory
predicts the lack of inversion symmetry can possibly give rise to exotic
superconducting properties due to the mixing of spin-singlet and triplet
order parameters [40], as well as to unusual surface states. This
possibly explains the measured critical fields are much larger than
H_(c). If the type-II/1 scenario would apply to PdTe₂, H_(c)^(s) would
signal the boundary of the field-induced vortex phase H_(c2), and
H_(c)^(R) is H_(c3). We recall that for PdTe₂, $\kappa=0.34<1/\sqrt{2}$,
and the dc magnetization data in Fig. 1, notably the small magnitude of
the tail when M(H) → 0, do not provide evidence for a bulk transition
from type I to type II. Moreover, signatures of supercooling (see SM
[31]) rule out type-II/1 superconductivity. Specific-heat measurements
in applied fields would be helpful to elucidate this further [21].

The structure of superconducting states in Dirac semimetals was recently
investigated by theoretical work [2, 41, 42, 43]. Depending on the
different pairing potentials, topological odd-parity superconductivity
in the bulk with gap nodes is a possibility. Since we find that PdTe₂ is
a conventional BCS superconductor, such a scenario is most likely ruled
out. On the other hand, ARPES measurements in the normal state reveal
the presence of a topological surface state [1, 13]. Possibly, a
superconducting gap opens in this topological surface state at
T_(c)^(s), below T_(c) of the bulk. Since superconductivity of the
surface layer has two critical fields, H_(c)^(s) and H_(c)^(R), and does
not fit into the standard BCS picture, we speculate it could have a
topological nature. This calls for an in-depth examination of
superconductivity in PdTe₂, by, e.g., scanning tunneling probe
techniques.

In summary, we have investigated the superconducting properties of the
compound PdTe₂ that was recently reported to be a type-II Dirac
semimetal. dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements clearly
show PdTe₂ is a type-I superconductor with T_(c) = 1.64 K and a critical
field μ₀H_(c)(0) = 13.6 mT. Our crystals also show the intermediate
state as is demonstrated by the differential paramagnetic effect
observed in the ac susceptibility. In addition, superconductivity of the
surface layer is found below T_(c)^(s) = 1.33 K  < T_(c). It persists up
to μ₀H_(c)^(s)(0) = 34.9 mT and does not follow the standard
Saint-James-de Gennes behavior. Resistance data point to an even larger
critical field for the surface layer H_(c)^(R)(0) ≈ 0.30 T. PdTe₂ is the
only topological material for which type-I superconductivity has been
reported so far. This, together with the unusual superconducting phase
diagram, calls for a close examination of superconductivity in PdTe₂,
especially in view of the presence of topological surface states.
