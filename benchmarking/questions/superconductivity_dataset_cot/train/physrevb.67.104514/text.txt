###### Abstract

We report the results from a resistance, and magnetization study on Ru1 - _A_A_S_T2 - \(B\)2 _R_Cu2O8 (_A_ = Sn,Nb, \(B\) = La, \(R\) = Eu,Gd) where the parent compound has previously been reported to display superconductivity and predominately low field antiferromagnetic order. We show that, contrary to a study on Ru1 - _S_nSnSr2GdCu2O8, there is no significant change in the superconducting transition temperature when Sn is substituted for Ru, implying that there is no significant Sn-induced charge transfer to the CuO2 planes. Furthermore, increasing the Sn concentration has the effect of increasing the temperature where zero resistance and the onset of bulk ac diamagnetic shielding occurs, which we interpret in terms of a decreasing ferromagnetic component leading to an increase in the temperature where the spontaneous vortex phase occurs. Contrary to previous studies on the pure compounds, we find an initial negative _dM_/_dB_ at low temperatures in magnetically ordered Ru1 - _S_nSnSr2_R_Cu2O8 for Sn concentrations at, and greater than, 0.1. The substitution of Ru by nuclei that have a larger (Nb5+) or smaller (Sn4+) valence results in a similar decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature and an increase in the average Ru valence. La substitution for Sr causes charge transfer to the CuO2 planes and an increase in the magnetic ordering temperature that is not expected.

## Introduction

It has recently been reported that the ruthenate cuprate, RuSr2_R_Cu2O8 (_R_ = Gd,Eu) displays superconductivity arising from the CuO2 planes [1-5] and magnetic order arising from the RuO2 layers [1-6]. These materials and the related ferromagnetic superconductors, RuSr2\(R\)2 - _A_CeCu2O10 + \(d\), were first discovered by Bauernfeind, Widder, and Braun. [1,2] It was originally believed that RuSr2_R_Cu2O8 is ferromagnetic; however, powder neutron diffraction studies have shown that the low field magnetic order is predominately antiferromagnetic. [3,4] The small ferromagnetic component, which orders at 132 K, is believed to be large enough to affect superconductivity unless there is some form of accommodation via a spatial modulation of the respective order parameters or a spontaneous vortex phase. [7,8] This model was originally proposed for the ferromagnetic superconductor, RuSr2\(R\)2 - _A_Ce_Cu2O10 + \(d\). [9] In this model, there exists a spontaneous vortex phase for _T_SVP < \(T\) < \(T\) , where the local field, _B_loc, is greater than the lower critical field _B_cl. For temperatures less than _T_SVP, _B_cl is greater than _B_loc and hence the bulk diamagnetic transition occurs. However, it has been suggested that a bulk diamagnetic transition does not occur in RuSr2_R_Cu2O8 because the derivative of the initial change in magnetization with increasing applied magnetic field is positive. [10,11] The application of the spontaneous vortex phase model to RuSr2_R_Cu2O8 has been indirect [7, 8] and it is not known if changing the magnetic ordering temperature and the ferromagnetic component will lead to changes in the magnetization data that are consistent with the spontaneous vortex model.

Recent theoretical band structure calculations based on the experimentally observed structure have concluded that antiferromagnetic order is energetically favored over ferromagnetic order in RuSr2GdCu2O8. [12] In particular, Nakamura _et al._ showed the importance of including the effect of the rotations of the RuO6 octahedra. Previous calculations by Pickett, Weht, and Schick [13] had concluded that the magnetic order was ferromagnetic but Pickett, Weht, and Schick had used the structure as determined by the analysis of the x-ray diffraction spectra where rotations of RuO6 octahedra could not be observed. Unfortunately, the experimental data shows that the magnetic order is more complex than purely antiferromagnetic. For example, Takagiwa _et al._[14] have reported the existence of a significant low field ferromagnetic component in RuSr2YCu2O8 [\(\sim 0.28\mu_{B}/\)Ru (Ref. [14])], which is \(\sim\)24% of the low field antiferromagnetic moment. They also reported a magnetic field induced transition to predominately high field ferromagnetic order, which has also reported in a study on RuSr2EuCu2O8. [15] Another problem in understanding the ruthenate cuprates is that RuSr2_R_Cu2O8 and RuSr2\(R\)2 - _A_Ce_Cu2O10 + \(d\) have essentially the same rotations of the RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra, Ru-O-Ru and Ru-O-Cu bond lengths [16] but the first compound displays a large antiferromagnetic component for low applied fields and a spin-flop transition with increasing applied field [1, 14, 16] while the second compound is predominately ferromagnetic. This would appear to suggest that the different magnetic order observed in RuSr\({}_{2}\)RCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) and RuSr\({}_{2}\)R\({}_{2-x}\)Ce\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10+\delta}\) is not driven by structurally induced changes in the RuO\({}_{2}\) layer conduction band. RuSr\({}_{2}\)RCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) is also believed to have a mixed Ru valence (average value \(\sim\)4.62) as determined by an x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) study. [17] The observation of a mixed Ru valence is supported by nuclear magnetic resonance studies. [18, 19] As far as we are aware, this is the only ruthenate compound where a mixed Ru valence is observed. This can be contrasted with RuSr\({}_{2}\)R\({}_{2-x}\)Ce\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10+\delta}\), where the Ru valence is near 5. [20, 21]

The similar bond angle distortions and bond lengths in the SrRuO\({}_{3}\) substructure but different average Ru valences in RuSr\({}_{2}\)RCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) and RuSr\({}_{2}\)R\({}_{2-x}\)Ce\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{10+\delta}\) would appear to suggest that band filling effects are responsible for the different magnetically ordered states. This can be contrasted with the ruthenates where isoelectronic substitution for atoms not in the RuO\({}_{2}\) layers shows that the magnetic ordering temperature is correlated with the rotation angle of the RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra and the Ru-O-Ru bond length, [22] which is consistent with a theoretical study by Mazin and Singh. [23] Electronic doping via substitutions for atoms not in the RuO\({}_{2}\) layers can lead to a change in the rotation and tilting of the RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra as well as electronic doping in the RuO\({}_{2}\) layers where the individual effects on the magnetic ordering temperature are not easy to separate. For example, Na\({}^{+}\) substitution for Sr\({}^{2+}\) in SrRuO\({}_{3}\) leads to a decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature as well as a transition from an itinerant ferromagnetic metal to a ferromagnetic semiconductor. [24] Direct substitution for Ru by a nonmagnetic atom with the same valence will lead to a decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature via a dilution of the magnetic lattice and broken superexchange paths. However, it is also believed that changes in the rotation and tilting of the RuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra are also important. [25] A study on Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) showed that the magnetic ordering temperature decreased with increasing Sn concentration. [26] This was accompanied by a large change in the Ru-O-Ru bond angle distortion that is nearly half of that observed in Sr\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)RuO\({}_{3}\), [22] which indicates that bond angle distortions and bond length changes also contribute to the decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature. The magnetization and resistance data were interpreted in terms of a fixed Ru valence of 4+ and charge transfer between the CuO\({}_{2}\) and RuO\({}_{2}\) layers. However, the \(x\) = 0 and \(x\) = 0.1 samples did not show zero resistance at a finite temperature and more recent measurements have found a mixed Ru valence in the pure compounds. [17, 18, 19]

It is apparent that further experimental research is required to enable a better understanding of the magnetic and superconducting order in the ruthenate cuprates. In this paper, we report the results from a resistance and magnetization study on RuSr\({}_{2}\)_R_Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), where the superconducting and magnetic order were probed by substituting La for Sr, Sn for Ru, and Nb for Ru.

## Experimental Details

The Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Nb\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), and RuSr\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) ceramic samples were made from a stoichiometric mix of RuO\({}_{2}\), SnO\({}_{2}\), Nb\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{5}\), SrCO\({}_{3}\), La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), Eu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), Gd\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), and CuO. The powder was first calcined in air at 960 degC for 12 h. The samples were then pressed into pellets and sintered at 1010 degC in N\({}_{2}\) gas for 10 h, 1050 degC in O\({}_{2}\) gas for 10 h, 1055 degC in O\({}_{2}\) gas for 10 h, and 1060 degC in O\({}_{2}\) gas for 10 h, 24 h, and 7 days. The samples were reground after sintering at each temperature. The initial sintering at 1010 degC was performed to suppress the formation of ferromagnetic SrRuO\({}_{3}\). As found in a previous study, [22] all Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)_R_Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) samples with \(x\) > 0 showed evidence of SrSnO\({}_{3}\) in the x-ray diffraction spectra which could not be decreased by additional sintering. However, as we show later, the magnetic ordering temperatures are lower than those found in the previous study on Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) for similar Sn concentrations. Furthermore, all our pure and Sn substituted samples display a zero resistance at finite temperatures, which was not reported in the previous study. There was no evidence of impurity phases in the Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Nb\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) and RuSr\({}_{1.9}\)La\({}_{0.1}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) x-ray diffraction spectra.

The ac and dc magnetization measurements were made using a SQUID magnetometer. The ac magnetization measurements were made with an ac field of 5 mT and a frequency of 1 kHz. The remanent magnetic field of the superconducting magnetic was \(\pm\)0.6 mT. The resistance measurements were made using the four terminal technique.

## Results and Analyses

We show in Fig. 1 the normalized resistance data from Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) [Fig. 1(a)] with \(x\) = 0 (solid curve) and \(x\) = 0.2 (dashed curve) and Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) [Fig. 1(b)] with \(x\) = 0, 0.1, and 0.3 (solid curves). Unlike the study on Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), [26] we find that the resistance for \(x\) = 0 and \(x\) = 0.2 does reach zero at a finite temperature. Furthermore, the temperature where the resistance is zero, \(T_{c}^{R}(0)\), systematically increases with increasing Sn concentration for both the Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) and Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) samples. It is possible that the samples used in the previous study on Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (Ref. [26]) were very disordered because it is known that annealing for an additional seven days leads to a \(T_{c}^{R}(0)\) of \(\sim\)35 K in RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\). [27, 28]

It has previously been shown that superconductivity in RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) occurs at \(\sim\)45 K and corresponds to the initial decrease in the resistance but the bulk diamagnetic transition occurs for temperatures below \(\sim\)35 K. [1, 27, 28] A similar effect was observed in RuSr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) where superconductivity and the initial decrease in the resistance occur near 32 K while the transition into the bulk diamagnetic state occurs near 12 K. [8, 15] As mentioned earlier, this has been attributed  to the existence of a spontaneous vortex phase. The normal-state resistance data shows a semiconductorlike increase for temperatures less than \(\sim\)100 K. It has recently been shown that this semiconductorlike increase is not intrinsic and is due to intergranular transport.[8] Therefore, it is not appropriate to use the initial decrease in the resistance as the criterion to determine \(T_{c}\). This is especially pertinent to the previous study on Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) where a semiconductorlike upturn was observed for all Sn concentrations and the peak in the resistance data was used to determine that \(T_{c}\) increased from 36 K to 48 K as the Sn concentration increased from 0 to 0.2.[26] However, it is apparent in Fig. 1 that there is no well-defined peak in the resistance data for Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) with \(x\!=\!0.3\) or Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) with \(x\!=\!0.2\) that can be used to estimate \(T_{c}\). It has previously been argued that \(T_{c}\) in the pure compound can also be estimated from the temperature where there is a significant increase in the derivative of the resistance.[27, 29] If we use a similar criteria to estimate \(T_{c}\) using the resistance data from our Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) samples, we obtain \(T_{c}\) values of 52 K and 49 K for \(x\!=\!0\) and \(x\!=\!0.2\), respectively. Thus, unlike the previous study on Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), we find no significant change in \(T_{c}\) , as estimated from the resistance data, with increasing Sn concentration.

Also plotted in Fig. 1(b) is the normalized resistance from Ru\({}_{0.6}\)Nb\({}_{0.4}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (dashed curve) and RuSr\({}_{1.9}\)La\({}_{0.1}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (dotted curve), where it can be seen that both samples do not exhibit a metallic ground state at low temperatures. The disappearance of superconductivity when La is substituted for Sr or Nb is substituted for Ru is likely to be due to charge transfer to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes and hence a decrease in the hole concentration on the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes. We first note that studies on the high temperature superconducting cuprates have shown that there is a good correlation between \(T_{c}\) and the hole concentration, \(p\), on the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes where superconductivity exists for 0.05\(\leq\)\(p\)\(\leq\)0.27. In particular, it has been found that

\[T_{c}(p)\!=\!T_{c,\rm max}[\,1\!-\!82.6(p\!-\!0.16)^{2}\,],\] (1)

where \(T_{c,\rm max}\) is the maximum \(T_{c}\) for each family of superconductors.[30] It should be noted that \(p\) is not the carrier concentration on the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes because the carrier concentration cannot be estimated in the usual way via the Hall coefficient owing to the strong dependence of the Hall coefficient on temperature. Rather, \(p\) derives from valence counting. For example, it is directly proportional to the Sr content in La\({}_{2-p}\)Sr\({}_{p}\)CuO\({}_{4}\). The effect of increasing (e.g., La\({}^{3+}\) for Sr\({}^{2+}\) in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\)) or decreasing (e.g., Ca\({}^{2+}\) for Y\({}^{3+}\) in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\)) the valence at one of the atomic sites can lead to a decrease or increase in \(p\). Recent studies have shown that RuSr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) is very underdoped where \(p\!\sim\!0.07\).[27, 31] Thus, substituting 0.1La\({}^{3+}\) for Sr\({}^{2+}\) could correspond to a maximum decrease in \(p\) to 0.02, which is in the insulator region. Similarly, applying the simple valence counting model to the substitution of Nb for Ru (average valence 4.62) shows that \(p\) could decrease to as low as \(-\)0.01, assuming that there is no change in the Ru valence. We show later that there is a small Nb-induced increase in the average Ru valence to 4.77 that corresponds to a decrease in \(p\) to \(-\)0.05, which is in the insulator region. Note that if there was charge transfer to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes in the Sn-substituted samples this would cause an increase of the hole concentration from \(\sim\)0.07 to \(\sim\)0.16 for 0.3Sn substitution. According to Eq. (1), \(T_{c}\) should increase considerably. However, as mentioned above a significant change in \(T_{c}\) is not observed. This implies that there is no Sn-induced charge transfer to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes and hence, in a simple valence counting model, Sn substitution should lead to an increase in the average Ru valence in the RuO\({}_{2}\) layers leading to an average Ru valence of up to 4.89 for \(x\!=\!0.3\).

The onset of bulk ac diamagnetic shielding for Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)_R_Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) can be seen in Fig. 2, where we plot the ac susceptibility. We use the ac susceptibility rather than dc susceptibility, because the remanent magnetization from the SQUID magnetometer superconducting magnet is close to the field where the bulk dc diamagnetic phase disappears in the pure samples. Furthermore, the small remanent field is sufficient to partially align the ferromagnetic component from the RuO\({}_{2}\) planes. It is clear than Sn substitution systematically increases the temperature where the transition into the bulk ac diamagnetic state commences. The real part of the ac susceptibility data also contains a contribution from the small ferromagnetic component, and hence the transition to the bulk diamagnetic state commences at a temperature greater than that where \(\chi^{\prime}\!=\!0\) occurs. The onset of bulk ac diamagnetic shielding in Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) is clear in the inset to Fig. 2(b), where we plot the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility, \(\chi^{\prime\prime}\). Thus, the bulk ac diamagnetic transition for Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) commences at temperatures of 11, 16, and 20 K for \(x\!=\!0\), 0.1, and 0.3, respectively. We show below that there is also a Sn-induced decrease in the ferro

Also shown in (b) is the resistance data from Ru\({}_{0.6}\)Nb\({}_{0.4}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (dashed curve) and RuSr\({}_{1.9}\)La\({}_{0.1}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) (dotted curve).

  magnetic component of the magnetization and the low temperature and high field magnetization. Thus, within the spontaneous vortex phase model, the increase in the diamagnetic transition temperature can be attributed to a decrease in the local field arising from the ferromagnetic component in the RuO\({}_{2}\) layers.

Unlike previous studies on RuSr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) and RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\), we find that the dc magnetization initially decreases with increasing magnetic field at 2 K for Sn concentrations \(\geq\)0.1. This is apparent in Fig. 3, where we plot the initial magnetization against the applied magnetic field at 2 K for Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) with \(x\!=\!0\), 0.1, and 0.3. It can be seen in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) that these samples are still magnetically ordered where the magnetic ordering temperature is above the superconducting ordering temperature.

As mentioned earlier, it has been argued that the absence of an initial negative \(dM/dB\) in magnetically ordered RuSr\({}_{2}\)ReCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) implies the absence of a bulk diamagnetic transition in this compound.[10]

It is clear in Fig. 4 that Sn or Nb substitution for Ru significantly suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature, while La substitution for Sr results in a small increase in the magnetic ordering temperature. The peak in the ac and dc data for the pure compound is also observed in RuSr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) at the same temperature of 132 K (not shown). This peak is close to the magnetic ordering temperature defined as the temperature where \(dM/dT\) is a maximum negative value. The effect of Sn or Nb substitution is to broaden the peak observed in the ac data and in the zero-field-cooled magnetization data for small applied fields. However, this low field peak has disappeared in the La substituted sample. Note that the magnetization data for the \(x\) = 0.3 Sn sample also has a small peak near 65 K, which indicates that there is an inhomogeneous Sn distribution. Despite repeated annealing, we were unable to reduce the magnitude of this small peak.

The low field peak at 132 K observed in the pure compound disappears for applied magnetic fields greater than \(\sim\)0.25 T and the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled hysteresis

  behavior disappears for applied magnetic fields greater than 2 T. The hysteresis behavior has been attributed to the small ferromagnetic component.[15] The appearance of bulk dc diamagnetic shielding at 5 mT for Sn substituted samples and \(x\)  0.1 makes it difficult to use the low temperature field-cooled magnetization to estimate the ferromagnetic component, as has been done for the pure compound.[15] However, it is evident in Fig. 4(b) that, in the absence of diamagnetic shielding, the low-temperature field-cooled magnetization from the \(x\) = 0.1 sample is ~44% of that in the pure compound. We also note that the magnetic ordering temperature for the \(x\) = 0.3 sample is close to the superconducting transition temperature, which indicates that spin fluctuations do not significantly affect the superconducting order in the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes.

The resulting magnetic ordering temperatures are plotted in Fig. 5, where it is apparent that Sn or Nb substitution for Ru cause a similar decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature. We note that the magnetic ordering temperature for our \(x\) = 0.3 sample (35 K) is significantly less than that reported in Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) with a similar nominal Sn concentration [~87 K (Ref. 26)]. The origin of the similar decrease in the magnetic ordering temperatures is discussed later. The effect of La substitution for Sr is to increase the magnetic ordering temperature to 160 K, which is not expected when compared with similar substitutions in the ruthenates and assuming that there is no charge transfer to the RuO\({}_{2}\) layers. For example, in Sr\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)RuO\({}_{3}\) , substituting Ca (ionic radii 0.112 nm) for the larger Sr (ionic radii 0.126 nm) results in an increase in the Ru-O-Ru bond angle distortion that affects the superexchange interaction and leads to a decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature.[22] The La ionic radii (0.116 nm) is also less than that of Sr (0.126 nm) and hence it might be expected that La substitution for Sr in RuSr\({}_{2}\)_R_Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) should also lead to an increase in the Ru-O-Ru bond angle distortion and hence a decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature.

The effect of Sn, Nb, or La substitution on the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization in RuSr\({}_{2}\)EuCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) can be seen in Fig. 6. The curves for Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)GdCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) are not shown because they are significantly distorted by the large moment from Gd\({}^{3+}\), which magnetically orders near 2.5 K.[3] The general feature of a gradual increase in the magnetization with increasing magnetic field is preserved irrespective of the substituted atom. In the case of the pure compound, the slow increase in the magnetization was attributed to a spin-flop transition[15] that was also evident from neutron diffraction measurements.[3, 14] Unfortunately, there is no neutron diffraction data for the substituted samples; however, the similar general increase in the magnetization may suggest a similar spin-flop transition from a predominately antiferromagnetic low field state.

The remanent magnetization for the pure compound is ~0.034\(\mu_{B}\)/Ru site, which is slightly less than that found in a previous study (~0.05\(\mu_{B}\)/Ru site[15]). It decreases to ~0.015\(\mu_{B}\)/Ru site for 0.4Nb substitution for Ru and for 0.1La substitution for Sr. The remanent magnetization is ~0.023\(\mu_{B}\)/Ru site and 0.026\(\mu_{B}\)/Ru site for the Sn substituted samples with \(x\) = 0.1 and 0.3, respectively, but these values are significantly affected by dc diamagnetic shielding. The effect of increasing Sn and Nb substitution for Ru, as well as La substitution for Sr is to decrease the high field magnetization, as can be seen in Fig. 6. This is more evident in the lower right inset to Fig. 6, where the magnetization is plotted at 6 T and per Ru site rather than per Ru atom (solid symbols). Correcting for the actual Ru concentration when Nb is substituted for Ru leads to a magnetization per Ru atom that is ~86% of that in the pure compound (open up triangle) and slightly higher than that from the La substituted sample (~0.66\(\mu_{B}\)/Ru atom or 80% of that from the pure compound). Unfortunately, the appearance of a Sn impurity

  phase means that the exact Sn fraction on the Ru sites in unknown and hence it is not possible to perform a similar calculation for the Sn substituted samples. However, it is clear that the magnetization at 6 T for \(x\) = 0.3 is less than 70% of that from the pure compound. Thus, the low temperature, high field moment per Ru is decreased by direct substitution onto the Ru site or by substitution of La for Sr.

As mentioned earlier, there is no Sn-induced charge transfer to the CuO2 planes and hence Sn substitution is expected to increase the average Ru valence. To determine if Nb substitution also changes the effective Ru valence, we estimate the moment per Ru atom above the magnetic ordering temperature in a manner similar to that of Butera _et al._[32] for the Ru0.6Nb0.4Sr2EuCu2O8 sample using the data plotted in Fig. 7. Here we plot _M_/_H_ for an applied magnetic field of 1 T (filled up triangles). We show in the inset that _M_/_H_ is independent of field for \(T\) > 130 K, which is ~80 K above the magnetic ordering temperature. The temperature above which _M_/_H_ is independent of field is significantly less than that found in RuSr2EuCu2O8, where _M_/_H_ is independent of field for temperatures above 200 K. [15] This corresponds to ~70 K above the magnetic ordering temperature and provides additional evidence that the intrinsic magnetic ordering temperature is reduced rather than phase separation occurring. Therefore, we fit the data in Fig. 7 above 150 K, and in the region where _M_/_H_ is independent of field, to

\[\chi = c/(T - \vartheta ) + \chi_{VV} + \chi_{0}\]

The first term is the Currie-Weiss term from the Ru moments with \(\vartheta\) being the Curie-Weiss temperature and \(c\) = \(\mu_{0}\rho N_{A}(1 - x)\mu_{B}^{2}P_{\rm eff}^{2}(M_{r}3k_{B})\) where \(\mu_{0}\) is the vacuum permeability, \(r\) is the sample density, _NA_ is Avogadro's constant, \(m_{B}\) is the Bohr magneton, \(M_{r}\) is the molecular weight, \(k_{B}\) is Boltzmann's constant, and _P_eff is the Ru effective Bohr magneton number. For Ru4+ with a low spin \(t_{2g}^{4}\) ground state, _P_eff=2.83 and for Ru5+ with a \(t_{2g}^{3}\) ground state, _P_eff =3.87. The second term in Eq. (1) is the van Vleck paramagnetism from Eu3+. As in a previous study, we use the crystal field parameter of 303 cm-1 found in Eu2CuO4. [33] This term is plotted in Fig. 7 (dashed curve). The final term in Eq. (2) contains the Pauli spin susceptibility from the CuO2 planes, any temperature independent Stoner enhanced term from the RuO2 layers and orbital and core terms. The contribution from the CuO2 planes is small and less than 4 x 10-5 in the high temperature superconducting cuprates. [34] Therefore, we approximate the contribution from the CuO2 planes as being temperature independent.

The resultant fit to Eq. (2) is plotted in Fig. 7. The fitting parameters are \(\vartheta = 29\) K, _P_eff=3.66, and _kh_0=12 x 10-5. We find that \(\vartheta\) is positive and ~21 K is less than the magnetic ordering temperature. A positive \(\vartheta\) would appear to suggest ferromagnetic correlations. However, a positive \(\vartheta\) was also observed in the pure compound (\(\vartheta = 100\) K) even though neutron diffraction measurements have now shown that the low temperature ground state is predominately ferromagnetic. [34] A similar apparent contradiction was observed in CaRuO3, where a negative \(\vartheta\) occurs that would appear to suggest antiferromagnetic correlations. [35] However, recent studies have shown that the correlations are ferromagnetic. [36] In the case of the Ru1-_A_A_S_T_2-_B_,\(B\),_R_Cu2O8 compounds these discrepancies between the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature and the low field magnetic ground state are related to the fact that the low-temperature magnetic ground state strongly depends on the external magnetic field. For example, as mentioned above, RuSr2_R_Cu2O8 displays a large antiferromagnetic component for low applied fields and a spin-flop transition into a ferromagnetic state with increasing applied magnetic field. [34, 16, 14]

The fitted value of _P_eff implies an average Ru valence of ~4.77, which is greater than that found in the pure compound [~4.62 (Ref. [17])] from the analysis of the XANES data. In a simple valence counting model, replacing Ru (average valence 4.62) with Nb5+ should lead to a decrease in the average Ru valence. Thus, similar to Sn substitution for Ru, we find that Nb5+ substitution also leads to an increase in the average Ru valence. Consequently, there is charge transfer to the CuO2 planes, which is consistent with the absence of superconductivity.

_kh_0 is larger than that found in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates, which indicates that there is a contribution from the RuO2 planes. By comparison with SrRuO3, we expect the orbital and core terms to be small and hence _kh_0 is dominated by the spin susceptibility in the RuO2 planes. We note that _kh_0 is less than that found in SrRuO3 [~50x10-5 (Ref. [25])], which has a significant Stoner enhancement.

Thus both Nb and Sn substitution for Ru lead to an increase in the average Ru valence as well as similar decreases in the magnetic ordering temperature. However, there is no evidence for a major change in the magnetic order or spin correlations from that observed in the pure compound. Rather, the major effect of Nb and Sn substitution is to dilute the magnetic lattice, leading to a decrease in the magnetic ordering temperature. There is also the added effect of the increase in the Ru-O-Ru bond angle distortions observed in Ru1-_x_Sn_x_Z_GdCu2O8. [26] In the absence of neutron diffrac

  tion data, it would seem reasonable to speculate that there is an increase in the RuO\({}_{6}\) rotation angle induced by Nb substitution.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we find that Sn substitution for Ru in Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)RCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) results in a systematic increase in the temperature where the bulk ac diamagnetic transition commences. This can be accounted for within the spontaneous vortex phase interpretation, by a decrease in the local field from the ferromagnetic component in the RuO\({}_{2}\) planes. We also find that \(dM/dB\) is initially negative for magnetically ordered Ru\({}_{1-x}\)Sn\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)RCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) when \(x\)\(\gg\)0.1, which is not observed in the pure compound. The appearance of an initially negative \(dM/dB\) for \(x\)\(\gg\)0.1 may be related to the decrease in the magnitude of the ferromagnetic component. The absence of superconductivity when 0.1 La is substituted for Sr or 0.4 Nb is substituted for Ru is likely to be due to a decrease in the hole concentration on the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes. However, contrary to a previous report, we find no evidence for Sn-induced charge transfer to the CuO\({}_{2}\) layers. Substitution of Sn or Nb for Ru, which is believed to have an average valence of \(\sim\)4.62 in the pure compound, leads to comparable decreases in the magnetic ordering temperature and an increase in the average Ru valence. However, there is no evidence for a change in the nature of the magnetic correlations or magnetic order. The magnetic ordering temperature decreases primarily due to a spin dilution of the magnetic lattice as well as broken superexchange paths. There is also the additional effect of an increase in the Ru-O-Ru bond angle distortion in Sn-substituted RuSr\({}_{2}\)RCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\) and it is possible that a similar decrease in the Ru-O-Ru bond angle distortion occurs in Nb-substituted RuSr\({}_{2}\)RCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8}\). The small decrease in the low-temperature moment per Ru is likely to be a consequence of spin dilution and broken superexchange paths. La substitution for Sr leads to a small increase in the magnetic ordering temperature that, by comparison with ruthenate compounds, is not expected.
