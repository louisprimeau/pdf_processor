###### Abstract

Thin-film YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} has been studied with in-plane magnetic fields B to 850 T, with good signal-to-noise to 300 T, using a GHz-transmission-line technique for electrical transport measurements in explosive-driven microsecond pulsed magnetic fields. At an ambient temperature of 1.6 K with _B\perpc_ axis we find an onset of dissipation at 150 T, the highest field reported, with a saturation of resistivity at 240 T. Comparison with the Pauli limit _B_{p}_= 155 T expected for this material suggests that the critical field is limited by spin paramagnetism. [S0163-1829(98)50422-5]

At low temperatures the upper critical magnetic fields _B_{c2}_ for high-_T_{c}_ cuprates exceed the maximum B available using steady-field magnets. Recent transport measurements[1] using ms-duration 60 T pulsed magnets have provided significant information on the normal state properties of cuprates having _T_{c}_<40 K, however, for materials with higher _T_{c}_, critical fields can only be attained using _destructive_ field generators. Such measurements are difficult, because fields above ~70 T can only be maintained for a few \mus. The resulting _dB1dt_ can reach 10^{9} T/s, creating voltage up to 1 kV in a conducting loop of area 1 mm^{2}.

Despite the considerable technical challenges, measurements in intense fields provide the possibility of exploring new physics.[2] Reentrant superconductivity at very high B has been proposed for electron systems near the quantum limit,[3] which is in the range 100-1000 T for cuprates. Additionally, recent data[4] for low-_T_{c}_ organic superconductors give _B_{c2}_ values which exceed the paramagnetic (or Pauli limit _B_{p}_,[5] beyond which singlet pairing of Cooper pairs is not possible within BCS theory. In the case of layered superconductors such as high-_T_{c}_ cuprates, if B is directed within the layers it is possible that _B_{p}_ will be reached before the conventional superconductor-normal transition associated with the collapse of the vortex lattice. The only previous low temperature measurement on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (YBCO) with _B\perpc_ was obtained at 94 GHz in B to ~800 T and indicated a broad superconductor-normal transition in the range 75-340 T.[6] Further measurements at lower frequencies, allowing a more straightforward comparison with theory, are clearly desirable.

Here we report data to 300 T obtained in pulsed magnetic field shots to 850 T on thin-film YBCO samples with _T_{c}_=84 K and a transition width ~4 K at B = 0.[7] Probe frequencies _r_=0.9-1.9 GHz were used with the maximum _h v_ = 8 \mueV corresponding to thermal energies below 1 K. In our measurements B was directed _perpendicular_ to the **c** axis. Previous measurements on similar samples in fields to ~150 T with _B parallel_ to the axis gave _B_{c2}^{r}_=110 T (Ref. [7]) and 135 T (Ref. [8]) at T = 2 - 4 K. A much larger critical field _B_{c2}ab_ = 674 T (Ref. [9]) is expected for _B\perpc_ due to the shorter coherence length _ekab_ in this orientation, however, before the magnetic length falls below _ekab_ , the paramagnetic limit _B_{p}_ should be reached. Based upon simple BCS theory _B_{p}(_T_ = 0) = _gT_{c}_(_B_ = 0) with g = 1.84 T/K,[5] yielding _B_{p}_=155 T for our samples, close to the field at which we observe an onset of dissipation.

The measurement technology developed for this experiment has been fully described elsewhere.[10] Magnetic fields up to 850 T were produced using implosive flux compression in a triple-liner MC1-class generator.[11] An initial magnetic flux was compressed by chemical explosives to produce a peak B in ~10 \mus, after which the generator, cryostat, and samples were destroyed. The experiment comprised two destructive pulses, in which a total of five YBCO samples were  monitored at various power levels, along with a number of semiconductor samples. Here we describe results obtained at the highest power level only (\sim1 mW), since lower powers gave poor signal-to-noise. Electrical connections to the samples were made using Au/Cu coplanar transmission lines (CTL's) patterned on a microwave printed circuit board (PCB) designed to avoid Faraday pickup.

The experimental configuration is shown in Fig. 1 and probes the in-plane resistivity \rho_{ab} of YBCO through its modulation of the transmission S of GHz radiation. Care was taken to ensure sample alignment within the MC1 generator to better than 1^{\circ}, minimizing the contribution from any component of B along the \epsilon axis. If the sample is superconducting the inner and outer conductors of the CTL triplet are shorted so that S is zero, except for a small contribution from cross-talk discussed below, whereas a perfect insulator has no effect on transmission. Although the sample impedance at 1 GHz is a complex quantity the measurement provides no phase information so, for simplicity, we assume that the impedance corresponds to a scalar resistivity \rho.[12]

The YBCO films, of thickness 100 nm, were prepared by pulsed laser deposition on MgO (001) substrates with the \mathbf{c} axis in the growth direction. Thermal isolation was achieved by patterning thin (80 nm) Au CTL's directly onto the samples (Fig. 1), bridging a gap in the thick (9 \mum) CTL's on the PCB, with an estimated maximum T increase at the sample of only 2 K from heating in the adjacent thick CTL's on the time scale of the field pulse.[10] To avoid the problem of erratic Ohmic contacts at large B, a 50 nm layer of Si,N_{4} dielectric was sandwiched between the YBCO mesa and the metal CTL's, so that the coupling between sample and CTL's was capacitive. To estimate T at the sample, Ge_{1-x}Au_{x} thin-film thermometers with large T-dependent resistivities were fabricated in a manner analogous with the YBCO samples. During MC1 pulses the thermometers allowed an upper bound of 10 K to be placed on the sample temperature for B<300 T.

Prior to the MC1 shots, the YBCO samples and measurement system were characterized using a single-turn coil pulsed field system[13] to assess the importance of dynamic effects. This system produces a 30 T nondestructive field with a rise time \sim3 \mus (inset to Fig. 2), giving a peak dB/dt\sim10^{7} T/s which, while around an order of magnitude smaller than the MC1 generators up to 300 T, provides indicative information. T was controlled between 77 K and T_{c}=84 K, so that the superconductor-normal transition could be observed for B\perpc. With a pulse cycle time of a few minutes it was possible to carry out a detailed study and the data was found to be reproducible after thermal cycling. The transmission S(B) is plotted at three temperatures approaching T_{c} in Fig. 2 (upper panel). The onset of dissipation at B_{\mathit{om}}^{ab} is evident in the two higher T traces, although S does not saturate, indicating B_{\mathit{c}}^{ab}>30 T in both cases.

The lower panel in Fig. 2 shows \rho_{ab}(B) at T=77 K obtained in a _millisecond_ pulsed B, where dc resistance measurements are straightforward. With B\perp\mathbf{c} we find a nonzero resistance for B>20 T. The GHz data at 77 K shows a decrease in S consistent with this, resulting from coupling of signal input to output along the 300 mm long tail of the PCB, so that S>0 even when \rho=0, as seen in Fig. 2. Interference of the transmitted and reflected modes along the CTL's then produces an initial _decrease_ in S as \rho_increases_, although S will always approach unity as \rho\rightarrow\infty.[14] The full response function S(\rho) is plotted as an inset to Fig. 3.

Nonequilibrium effects in the YBCO samples are unimportant on ms time scales or longer, since our dc resistance data in ms pulsed B to 50 T showed negligible hysteresis between field sweeps with B increasing and decreasing. However, single-turn coil measurements on \mus time scales with B\mid\mathbf{c} indicate that B_{\mathit{c}}^{2} and B_{\mathit{om}}^{c} can occur at _lower_

  fields than when measured in ms pulses, probably due to eddy current heating.[7] In our measurements any time dependence resulting from eddy current heating or flux flow dynamics should be much smaller, since B is directed in the plane of the YBCO film. Significantly, the results in Fig. 2 confirm this, with the \mus data being almost perfectly symmetric about B = 0, inferring only minor time-dependent effects.

With this check in place, Fig. 3 shows results for T = 1.6 K, i.e., T/T_{c}\sim0.02, in an 850 T MC1 field pulse. Only data to 320 T is plotted, since results above this field were obscured by noise, discussed below. We observe the onset of a dissipative (\rho>0) state at B_{on}^{ab}=(150\pm20) T and define B^{*}_{c2}^{ab}=(240\pm30) T as the field at which S, and therefore \rho, saturates, using an asterisk to indicate that the transition may result from paramagnetic limiting. The uncertainties in B reflect the noise-limited accuracy with which we can define inflection points in the S data, together with an estimate of timing accuracy.

To obtain _resistivity_ from the transmission data in Fig. 3 we calculated the response function S(\rho) (inset to Fig. 3) using the known capacitance between CTL's and sample, and the fraction of the signal that directly leaks from input to output, determined from S at B = 0. The resistivity \rho_{ab}(B) was then determined using an inverse response after smoothing the raw S(B) data and the result is plotted in Fig. 3. The normal state resistivity \rho_{ab} = 4.1\times10^{-7}\Omegam in Fig. 3 is 30% above the resistivity at T = 77 K and B = 40 T obtained from dc measurements with B|_{C} (Fig. 2). Although a reduced \rho_{ab} is expected at lower T, this has probably been offset by positive magnetoresistance in the film.

To determine the YBCO response in Fig. 3 accurately it was necessary to subtract from the raw data a noise background (as shown), obtained by monitoring the CTL's with no input power. Below 300 T the noise is small and occurred in the interval 140-190 T, due to the fusion of metal wires comprising the second of the three generator liners. Above 300 T wire fusion proceeded in the third liner with the noise creating severe problems for transport measurements. The origin of the noise is evident in Fig. 4. When the implosive shock wave fused a liner in the generator, the increase in dB/dt slowed as kinetic energy was absorbed and electrical noise greatly increased. To obtain measurements at higher B, single-liner generators with no electrical fusion noise will be a necessary compromise.

To our knowledge B_{on}^{ab}\sim150 T is the largest field in which a superconducting phase has been observed. A broader superconductor-normal transition than observed here, spanning 75-340 T, has been observed in previous measurements,[5] possibly due to the high frequency (94 GHz) used. We also note that the strongest saturation feature present in this data[6] is near our critical field of 240 T.

The importance of spin paramagnetism in a type-II superconductor can be assessed by comparing B_{p} with the critical field B^{0}_{c2} determined by orbital effects alone, given by B^{0}_{c2}(T = 0) = 0.70 T_{c}(\delta B_{c2}/\delta T)|_{T_{c}}.[15] The paramagnetic limit B_{p} is determined within BCS theory from \Delta_{0} = \sqrt{2}\,\mu_{B}B_{p} , which relates the energy gap \Delta_{0} with the Zeeman energy, where \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton. This then gives B_{p}=T_{c}^{\prime} with \gamma = 1.84 T/K.[5] A treatment which goes beyond BCS theory by including strong coupling effects for d-wave superconductivity predicts 1.5<\gamma<1.8 over a wide

Fusion occurs when the shock wave hits a liner in the generator, causing electrical noise and a slowdown in the rise of dB/dt.

  parameter range.[16] For most superconductors B_{p}>B^{0}_{\ c2}, although there are exceptions. For example, the upper critical fields of Nb_{3}Sn and some related compounds have been known to be determined by paramagnetic limiting for some time.[17] More recent measurements have also demonstrated this for the heavy-fermion compound UPd_{2}Al_{3}.[18]

In high-T_{c} cuprates B^{0}_{\ c2}, as determined by measurement of (\partial B_{c2}/\partial T) close to T_{c} , is generally much larger for B\bot**c** than for B|**c**, due to the shorter coherence lengths perpendicular to the CuO planes. In YBCO, B^{0}_{\ c2}^{c}=122 T and B^{0}_{\ c2}^{ab}=674 T, corresponding to \xi_{c}=16 A and \xi_{ab}=3 A.[9] Assuming the BCS value of \gamma=1.84, for our samples B_{p}=155 T and so paramagnetic effects are not significant when B|c, as confirmed experimentally,[7, 8] but should be important when B\bot c.

The observations that B^{\bullet}^{ab} is well below B^{0}_{\ c2}^{ab} and that B_{oa}^{ab} coincides with B_{p}, within experimental uncertainty, suggest that paramagnetic limiting determines the critical field in YBCO for B\bot**c**. The fact that B^{\bullet}^{ab} exceeds the BCS value of B_{p} by 50% in our measurements means that more detailed models may be necessary to determine B_{p} in cuprates, or possibly, that spin relaxation dynamics may be relevant, since B increases from 150 T to 240 T in only \sim1 \mus. More speculatively, Fulde-Ferrell[19] or triplet superconducting phases may exist in the range 150-240 T. Finally, it has been pointed out that resistivity data does not always give an accurate value for the critical field,[20] with saturation values often exceeding B_{c2} determined from specific heat or magnetization measurements, although this discrepancy is thought to be associated with vortex lattice melting and may not necessarily occur when paramagnetic limiting dominates.

In summary, via a clear transport signature we have measured B^{\bullet}^{ab}=240 T for thin-film YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\beta} with an onset of dissipation at 150 T, representing a new upper bound for superconductivity in any material. From a comparison with B^{0}_{\ c2}^{ab}=674 T, assuming no spin paramagnetism, and B_{p}=155 T, it would appear that the critical field with B\bot_c_ is primarily determined by paramagnetic limiting, in contrast with the case for B\|c. This may also be the case for other cuprate superconductors, particularly those with greater anisotropy than YBCO. Although electrical noise remains a problem at low signal levels, alternative magnetic generators should open the way for measurements at even higher fields, where phenomena such as reentrant superconductivity may occur.

###### Abstract

Thin-film YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} has been studied with in-plane magnetic fields B to 850 T, with good signal-to-noise to 300 T, using a GHz-transmission-line technique for electrical transport measurements in explosive-driven microsecond pulsed magnetic fields. At an ambient temperature of 1.6 K with _B\perpc_ axis we find an onset of dissipation at 150 T, the highest field reported, with a saturation of resistivity at 240 T. Comparison with the Pauli limit _B_{p}_= 155 T expected for this material suggests that the critical field is limited by spin paramagnetism. [S0163-1829(98)50422-5]

At low temperatures the upper critical magnetic fields _B_{c2}_ for high-_T_{c}_ cuprates exceed the maximum B available using steady-field magnets. Recent transport measurements[1] using ms-duration 60 T pulsed magnets have provided significant information on the normal state properties of cuprates having _T_{c}_<40 K, however, for materials with higher _T_{c}_, critical fields can only be attained using _destructive_ field generators. Such measurements are difficult, because fields above ~70 T can only be maintained for a few \mus. The resulting _dB1dt_ can reach 10^{9} T/s, creating voltage up to 1 kV in a conducting loop of area 1 mm^{2}.

Despite the considerable technical challenges, measurements in intense fields provide the possibility of exploring new physics.[2] Reentrant superconductivity at very high B has been proposed for electron systems near the quantum limit,[3] which is in the range 100-1000 T for cuprates. Additionally, recent data[4] for low-_T_{c}_ organic superconductors give _B_{c2}_ values which exceed the paramagnetic (or Pauli limit _B_{p}_,[5] beyond which singlet pairing of Cooper pairs is not possible within BCS theory. In the case of layered superconductors such as high-_T_{c}_ cuprates, if B is directed within the layers it is possible that _B_{p}_ will be reached before the conventional superconductor-normal transition associated with the collapse of the vortex lattice. The only previous low temperature measurement on YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} (YBCO) with _B\perpc_ was obtained at 94 GHz in B to ~800 T and indicated a broad superconductor-normal transition in the range 75-340 T.[6] Further measurements at lower frequencies, allowing a more straightforward comparison with theory, are clearly desirable.

Here we report data to 300 T obtained in pulsed magnetic field shots to 850 T on thin-film YBCO samples with _T_{c}_=84 K and a transition width ~4 K at B = 0.[7] Probe frequencies _r_=0.9-1.9 GHz were used with the maximum _h v_ = 8 \mueV corresponding to thermal energies below 1 K. In our measurements B was directed _perpendicular_ to the **c** axis. Previous measurements on similar samples in fields to ~150 T with _B parallel_ to the axis gave _B_{c2}^{r}_=110 T (Ref. [7]) and 135 T (Ref. [8]) at T = 2 - 4 K. A much larger critical field _B_{c2}ab_ = 674 T (Ref. [9]) is expected for _B\perpc_ due to the shorter coherence length _ekab_ in this orientation, however, before the magnetic length falls below _ekab_ , the paramagnetic limit _B_{p}_ should be reached. Based upon simple BCS theory _B_{p}(_T_ = 0) = _gT_{c}_(_B_ = 0) with g = 1.84 T/K,[5] yielding _B_{p}_=155 T for our samples, close to the field at which we observe an onset of dissipation.

The measurement technology developed for this experiment has been fully described elsewhere.[10] Magnetic fields up to 850 T were produced using implosive flux compression in a triple-liner MC1-class generator.[11] An initial magnetic flux was compressed by chemical explosives to produce a peak B in ~10 \mus, after which the generator, cryostat, and samples were destroyed.

Prior to the MC1 shots, the YBCO samples and measurement system were characterized using a single-turn coil pulsed field system[13] to assess the importance of dynamic effects. This system produces a 30 T nondestructive field with a rise time \sim3 \mus (inset to Fig. 2), giving a peak dB/dt\sim10^{7} T/s which, while around an order of magnitude smaller than the MC1 generators up to 300 T, provides indicative information. T was controlled between 77 K and T_{c}=84 K, so that the superconductor-normal transition could be observed for B\perpc. With a pulse cycle time of a few minutes it was possible to carry out a detailed study and the data was found to be reproducible after thermal cycling. The transmission S(B) is plotted at three temperatures approaching T_{c} in Fig. 2 (upper panel). The onset of dissipation at B_{\mathit{om}}^{ab} is evident in the two higher T traces, although S does not saturate, indicating B_{\mathit{c}}^{ab}>30 T in both cases.

The lower panel in Fig. 2 shows \rho_{ab}(B) at T=77 K obtained in a _millisecond_ pulsed B, where dc resistance measurements are straightforward. With B\perp\mathbf{c} we find a nonzero resistance for B>20 T. The GHz data at 77 K shows a decrease in S consistent with this, resulting from coupling of signal input to output along the 300 mm long tail of the PCB, so that S>0 even when \rho=0, as seen in Fig. 2. Interference of the transmitted and reflected modes along the CTL's then produces an initial _decrease_ in S as \rho_increases_, although S will always approach unity as \rho\rightarrow\infty.[14] The full response function S(\rho) is plotted as an inset to Fig. 3.

Nonequilibrium effects in the YBCO samples are unimportant on ms time scales or longer, since our dc resistance data in ms pulsed B to 50 T showed negligible hysteresis between field sweeps with B increasing and decreasing. However, single-turn coil measurements on \mus time scales with B\mid\mathbf{c} indicate that B_{\mathit{c}}^{2} and B_{\mathit{om}}^{c} can occur at _lower_

  fields than when measured in ms pulses, probably due to eddy current heating.[7] In our measurements any time dependence resulting from eddy current heating or flux flow dynamics should be much smaller, since B is directed in the plane of the YBCO film. Significantly, the results in Fig. 2 confirm this, with the \mus data being almost perfectly symmetric about B = 0, inferring only minor time-dependent effects.

With this check in place, Fig. 3 shows results for T = 1.6 K, i.e., T/T_{c}\sim0.02, in an 850 T MC1 field pulse. Only data to 320 T is plotted, since results above this field were obscured by noise, discussed below. We observe the onset of a dissipative (\rho>0) state at B_{on}^{ab}=(150\pm20) T and define B^{*}_{c2}^{ab}=(240\pm30) T as the field at which S, and therefore \rho, saturates, using an asterisk to indicate that the transition may result from paramagnetic limiting. The uncertainties in B reflect the noise-limited accuracy with which we can define inflection points in the S data, together with an estimate of timing accuracy.

To obtain _resistivity_ from the transmission data in Fig. 3 we calculated the response function S(\rho) (inset to Fig. 3) using the known capacitance between CTL's and sample, and the fraction of the signal that directly leaks from input to output, determined from S at B = 0. The resistivity \rho_{ab}(B) was then determined using an inverse response after smoothing the raw S(B) data and the result is plotted in Fig. 3. The normal state resistivity \rho_{ab} = 4.1\times10^{-7}\Omegam in Fig. 3 is 30% above the resistivity at T = 77 K and B = 40 T obtained from dc measurements with B|_{C} (Fig. 2). Although a reduced \rho_{ab} is expected at lower T, this has probably been offset by positive magnetoresistance in the film.

To determine the YBCO response in Fig. 3 accurately it was necessary to subtract from the raw data a noise background (as shown), obtained by monitoring the CTL's with no input power. Below 300 T the noise is small and occurred in the interval 140-190 T, due to the fusion of metal wires comprising the second of the three generator liners. Above 300 T wire fusion proceeded in the third liner with the noise creating severe problems for transport measurements. The origin of the noise is evident in Fig. 4. When the implosive shock wave fused a liner in the generator, the increase in dB/dt slowed as kinetic energy was absorbed and electrical noise greatly increased. To obtain measurements at higher B, single-liner generators with no electrical fusion noise will be a necessary compromise.

To our knowledge B_{on}^{ab}\sim150 T is the largest field in which a superconducting phase has been observed. A broader superconductor-normal transition than observed here, spanning 75-340 T, has been observed in previous measurements,[5] possibly due to the high frequency (94 GHz) used. We also note that the strongest saturation feature present in this data[6] is near our critical field of 240 T.

The importance of spin paramagnetism in a type-II superconductor can be assessed by comparing B_{p} with the critical field B^{0}_{c2} determined by orbital effects alone, given by B^{0}_{c2}(T = 0) = 0.70 T_{c}(\delta B_{c2}/\delta T)|_{T_{c}}.[15] The paramagnetic limit B_{p} is determined within BCS theory from \Delta_{0} = \sqrt{2}\,\mu_{B}B_{p} , which relates the energy gap \Delta_{0} with the Zeeman energy, where \mu_{B} is the Bohr magneton. This then gives B_{p}=T_{c}^{\prime} with \gamma = 1.84 T/K.[5] A treatment which goes beyond BCS theory by including strong coupling effects for d-wave superconductivity predicts 1.5<\gamma<1.8 over a wide

Figure 4: B and dB/dt plotted as a function of time for an MC1 generator field pulse. Also plotted is the noise power on a bare transmission line with no sample or input signal. Fusion occurs when the shock wave hits a liner in the generator, causing electrical noise and a slowdown in the rise of dB/dt.

  parameter range.[16] For most superconductors B_{p}>B^{0}_{\ c2}, although there are exceptions. For example, the upper critical fields of Nb_{3}Sn and some related compounds have been known to be determined by paramagnetic limiting for some time.[17] More recent measurements have also demonstrated this for the heavy-fermion compound UPd_{2}Al_{3}.[18]

In high-T_{c} cuprates B^{0}_{\ c2}, as determined by measurement of (\partial B_{c2}/\partial T) close to T_{c} , is generally much larger for B\bot**c** than for B|**c**, due to the shorter coherence lengths perpendicular to the CuO planes. In YBCO, B^{0}_{\ c2}^{c}=122 T and B^{0}_{\ c2}^{ab}=674 T, corresponding to \xi_{c}=16 A and \xi_{ab}=3 A.[9] Assuming the BCS value of \gamma=1.84, for our samples B_{p}=155 T and so paramagnetic effects are not significant when B|c, as confirmed experimentally,[7, 8] but should be important when B\bot c.

The observations that B^{\bullet}^{ab} is well below B^{0}_{\ c2}^{ab} and that B_{oa}^{ab} coincides with B_{p}, within experimental uncertainty, suggest that paramagnetic limiting determines the critical field in YBCO for B\bot**c**. The fact that B^{\bullet}^{ab} exceeds the BCS value of B_{p} by 50% in our measurements means that more detailed models may be necessary to determine B_{p} in cuprates, or possibly, that spin relaxation dynamics may be relevant, since B increases from 150 T to 240 T in only \sim1 \mus. More speculatively, Fulde-Ferrell[19] or triplet superconducting phases may exist in the range 150-240 T. Finally, it has been pointed out that resistivity data does not always give an accurate value for the critical field,[20] with saturation values often exceeding B_{c2} determined from specific heat or magnetization measurements, although this discrepancy is thought to be associated with vortex lattice melting and may not necessarily occur when paramagnetic limiting dominates.

In summary, via a clear transport signature we have measured B^{\bullet}^{ab}=240 T for thin-film YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\beta} with an onset of dissipation at 150 T, representing a new upper bound for superconductivity in any material. From a comparison with B^{0}_{\ c2}^{ab}=674 T, assuming no spin paramagnetism, and B_{p}=155 T, it would appear that the critical field with B\bot_c_ is primarily determined by paramagnetic limiting, in contrast with the case for B\|c. This may also be the case for other cuprate superconductors, particularly those with greater anisotropy than YBCO. Although electrical noise remains a problem at low signal levels, alternative magnetic generators should open the way for measurements at even higher fields, where phenomena such as reentrant superconductivity may occur.
