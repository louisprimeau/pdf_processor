###### Abstract

Specific heat measurements of samples of U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) utilizing extremely fine gradations of \(x\) near \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\), where two superconducting phases are known to occur for \(x_{c1}<x<x_{c2}\), were undertaken to study the genesis of the second transition. Surprisingly, this precise delineation of \(x\) in the critical regions of the phase diagram has revealed a strong peaking of the discontinuity in the specific heat \(\Delta C\) at the superconducting transition that varies rapidly with \(x\) as the two transition concentration regime is approached from either side in the phase diagram. This was not seen in earlier pressure work. Correlated with the discovery of a sharp increase in \(\Delta C\) at \(T_{c}\) at both \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\), the present work observes also a sharp increase in the normal state specific heat \(\gamma\) at both \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\), as well as peaks in \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}\) at both critical concentrations. The implications for understanding the superconductivity in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) are discussed, including the possibility that the second transition for \(x_{c1}<x<x_{c2}\) is caused by the anomalous behavior in \(\gamma\propto N(0)(1+\lambda)\).

## Introduction

The discovery[1] by Ott _et al._ of two distinct transitions in the specific heat of U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), \(\sim\) 0.02\(<\)\(x\)\(\ll\) \(\sim\) 0.04, remains a focus of considerable interest due to the as yet unknown type(s) of superconductivity involved. Several recent reviews[2; 3; 4] have quite thoroughly discussed the large body of experimental and theoretical work carried out in trying to determine the following. (1) Why does Th of all dopants produce a second, apparently superconducting, transition in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) beginning at \(x\sim\) 0.02? (2) What kind of superconductivity is involved at the two transitions? (3) Why does the second transition disappear with increasing Th content at about \(x=0.04\)?

Concerning the second question, current thinking[4; 5] holds the superconducting transition for \(x<x_{c1}\) (\(\sim\)0.02) and the upper transition for \(x_{c1}<x<x_{c2}\) (see Fig. 1 below for a plot of \(T_{c}\) vs \(x\)) to be different in nature since the suppression of the two transitions with pressure differs[6] by more than a factor of 2; in contrast, the same measurements established that the superconducting transition for \(x<x_{c1}\) has the same pressure dependence as the lower transition for \(x_{c1}<x\)\(<x_{c2}\). Further differences exist between the two transitions for \(x_{c1}<x<x_{c2}\). At the lower (but not the upper) transition a large peak in the ultrasound attenuation,[7] the onset of a small (\(\sim\) \(\sim\) 10\({}^{-3}\mu_{B}\)) magnetic moment measured[8] via \(\mu\)SR, an increase[6] in the slope of \(H_{c1}\) vs \(T\) (taken as an indication that the lower transition is, in addition to its coincidence with magnetic behavior, also superconducting), and a large anomaly[10] in the thermal expansion are observed. The magnetic field dependences of both transitions have been reported for \(x=0.022\) (Ref. [11]) and \(x=0.03\) (Ref. [12]) with the common result that the slope of the upper critical field with temperature near \(T_{c}(H=0)\), \(H^{\prime}_{c2}\), is the same for both transitions. At higher fields, Ref. [11] found that the upper transition merges into the lower one. Consistent with the fact (see Fig. 1) that \(T_{c}\) grows with increasing \(x>x_{c1}\) (\(\ll\) increasing impurities) for the upper transition, while it falls for the lower transition, theorists generally[3; 5] consider the upper transition to be \(s\)-wave superconductivity (BCS) while the lower transition has been variously[2; 3; 4; 5] described, including \(d\)-wave superconductivity. A recent doping study,[14] where the response of the two transitions to magnetic and unmagnetic (La, Gd) doping of U\({}_{0.97}\)Th\({}_{0.03}\)Be\({}_{13}\) was studied, found evidence that indeed the upper transition behaves similarly to a conventional \(s\)-wave superconductor while the lower transition does not. A further study[15] of the temperature dependence of the specific heat below the upper transition also concluded that this transition was consistent with \(s\)-wave BCS superconductivity.

Experimental or theoretical insight into the other two extant questions for understanding U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), i.e., concerning why Th produces these two transitions for \(x_{c1}<x<x_{c2}\), is mostly lacking. It has been remarked[16; 17] that the peak in the resistivity \(\rho\) of UBe\({}_{13}\) at 2.5 K shifts downward with Th doping such that the peak in \(\rho\) at \(x_{c1}\) is just shifted to \(T_{c}(x_{c1})\), "allowing," not causing, other phase transitions to occur. The peak in \(\rho\) at 2.5 K in UBe\({}_{13}\) corresponds to a peak in the specific heat \(C\) also at 2.5 K, whereby the peak in \(C\) can be more precisely followed as a function of  Th doping. A study[18] of this peak in \(C\) in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) found a suppression of the peak in temperature and also in size with increasing \(x\), with the peak still clearly present at \(T\)\(\sim\) 1.5 K for \(x\) = 0.02 and absent for \(x\) = 0.03. Another study[19] of the peak in \(C\) as a function of Th content found the peak still present (in size about 15% of \(\Delta\)\(C\) in pure UBe\({}_{13}\)) for \(x\) = 0.0245, contradicting the (less precise) resistivity data. The entropy [\(S\) = \(\int\) (\(C/T\))\(dT\)] under the peak in pure UBe\({}_{13}\) (0.7 J/mol K) shifts downwards with increasing \(x\) and appears[18] in the low temperature \(\gamma\) (=\(\rm{C}_{\rm{estrap}}^{\rm{normal}}\)/\(T\), hereafter \(C^{\alpha}\)/\(T\), as \(T\) \(\rightarrow\) 0). Thus \(\gamma\) for U\({}_{0.97}\)Th\({}_{0.36}\)Be\({}_{13}\)\(\cong\) 2300 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) vs \(\gamma\) = 1000 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) for pure UBe\({}_{13}\).[2]

In order to investigate the role of Th in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), as well as to better understand the genesis of the double superconducting transitions, an investigation of the specific heat in the _close_ neighborhood of \(x_{c1}\) (\(x_{c2}\)) where the second transition first appears (disappears) has the potential to reveal new information. Data to date[1, 20] for \(x\) = 0.019, 0.0216, 0.0378, and 0.0433 reveal no trace of a separate transition at \(x\) = 0.019 and 0.0433, and quite sizable double transitions (\(\Delta\)\(C_{1}\)\(\sim\)\(\Delta\)\(C_{2}\)) already existing at \(x\) = 0.0216 and 0.0378. Thermodynamic considerations[21] demand either that (a) one of the observed superconducting transitions at the critical points be first order,[22] (b) if the transitions are second order, a second, as yet unobserved,[23] superconducting transition must exist for \(x\) just near \(x_{c}\) , but outside of \(x_{c1}\)\(\ll\)\(x\)\(\ll\)\(x_{c2}\), (c) as \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c}\) from within \(x_{c1}\)\(\ll\)\(x\)\(\ll\)\(x_{c2}\), \(dT_{c1}\)/\(dx\) = \(dT_{c2}\)/\(dx\) where \(T_{c1}\) is the transition temperature of the higher temperature, upper transition and \(T_{c2}\) is the transition temperature of the lower transition ("tangential approach"), or (d) as \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c}\) from within \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\), either \(\Delta\)\(C_{1}\) or \(\Delta\)\(C_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) 0.

Until now, the only careful specific heat investigation near \(x_{c}\) was a pressure experiment[6] for U\({}_{0.978}\)Th\({}_{0.022}\)Be\({}_{13}\) (i.e., near \(x_{c1}\)) up to 2.5 kbar where the two transitions were brought together around 2 kbar. In that study, pressure was equated to decreasing Th content (Th expands the UBe\({}_{13}\) lattice), i.e., electronic effects (La and Pr also expand UBe\({}_{13}\), but generate no second transition) were outside the scope of the study. Thus, 0.1 kbar\(\equiv\)0.0002 Th content, such that the double transition regime was suppressed around (an equivalent) \(x\) = 0.018. Additionally, the size of the jump in \(C\) at \(T_{c}\) , \(\Delta\)\(C\)(\(T_{c}\)), was found[6] to decrease with increasing pressure.

In order to further investigate the region near \(x_{c1}\) , including electronic effects, as well as to perform a detailed specific heat study near \(x_{c2}\) the current work presents specific heat measurements of U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) with very small steps (\(\Delta\)\(x\)\(\geq\) 0.0007) in \(x\) near \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\). Samples were made as the work progressed based on the unfolding results so that the very high purity U and Be could be used as efficiently as possible for the critical concentrations. Thus, we report here on high purity samples of U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), \(x\) = 0.01, 0.017, 0.0178, 0.0185, 0.022, 0.043, 0.0455, 0.0465, 0.052.

## Experiment

As correctly stated in the specific heat under pressure experiment[6] by Zieve _et al._ on U\({}_{0.978}\)Th\({}_{0.022}\)Be\({}_{13}\), studying the vicinity of a critical point using composition of physical samples as a (extremely fine) control parameter is difficult. In order to avoid, as much as possible, sample variation, the highest available purity starting materials--electrotransport refined U from Ames Laboratory and 99.999% pure crystalline "MBE quality" Be from Atomergic (at $800/g)--were used. Samples were melted in a dedicated-for-Be-use arc melter under a purified Ar atmosphere. In order to precisely monitor any possible Th loss (Th masses for a nominal U charge of 400 mg were as low as 3.9 mg) during the first melting of Th with other material, U and Th were first melted together. Since both have low vapor pressures at their melting temperatures (in contrast to Be), any loss could be controlled to 0.05 mg, or approximately \(\Delta\)\(x_{\rm{Th}}\)= 0.0001. All meltings were done using the same procedures and performed by the same operator. After arc-melting the U and Th together three times, the resulting metal button was melted together with 1.06 times the correct stoichiometric amount of Be (to allow for Be weight loss) and then flipped and re-melted two successive times. All samples were x rayed using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer; the powder was mixed with Si powder to provide an internal reference. The cubic U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) lattice parameters so obtained, including also data for \(x\) = 0.03, 0.038, and 0.10 from our previous work, are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Near \(x_{c2}\) , for example, the deviations from the linear Vegard's law lattice parameter behavior shown in Fig. 2 would indicate that the \(x\) = 0.043 sample is really \(x\) = 0.042 and that the \(x\) = 0.0465 sample has the actual Th concentration \(x\) = 0.487. None of these possible deviations either bring the composition of one sample--as determined by lattice parameter--onto that of an adjacent composition or, as will be seen below, change any conclusions.

Specific heat measurements[24, 25] were performed on 1-2 mg pieces of each sample taken from the top of the respective arc-melted buttons. As an indicator of homogeneity, a second sample of \(x\) = 0.0455 was also measured from the middle of the arc-melted button and gave a \(\Delta\)\(C\) 11% smaller

Figure 1: \(T_{c}\) for U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) is plotted vs \(x\), whereby for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\) two transitions in the specific heat are observed. In addition to the increased concentration of points near \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\) , note two main features of this diagram that are different than the diagrams of Ott[13] and Heffner _et al.[3]_ (1) As shown here for high quality, high purity samples, \(T_{c}\) of the lower transition (\(T_{c2}\)) decreases significantly for \(x\)\(>\)\(x_{c1}\), before rising again as \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c2}\) whereby in the literature (Refs. 3, 13) \(T_{c2}\) is approximately constant. (2) \(T_{c}\)(\(x_{c1}\)) appears to be constant over a range of composition in the single transition region as \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c1}\) whereby for \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c2}\) , from above, \(T_{c}\) does not appear to have a region where it is constant. See also the text and Figs. 3 and 4. The dashed line marked by “a question mark” to the left of \(x_{c1}\) indicates a possible fourth transition, consistent with thermodynamics—choice (b) in the text.

  and the same \(T_{c}\). As will be seen below, such a variation also does not change any trends or conclusions.

## Results and discussion

The specific heats divided by temperature of the samples near \(x_{c1}\) are shown in Fig. 3, while the data for the samples near \(x_{c2}\) are shown in Fig. 4. As may be seen, without recourse to any optimizing of the jumps in the specific heat using the equal area construction,[26] the size of \(\Delta C/T\) grows significantly and quite rapidly as a function of \(x\) near both \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\). [For want of a more precise definition, let us for the following define \(x_{c1}\) (\(x_{c2}\)) as the concentration where \(\Delta C/T\) is a maximum as \(x\) approaches (departs) the double transition regime, i.e., \(x_{c1}\)\(\equiv\)\(0.0178\) and \(x_{c2}\)\(\equiv\)\(0.0455\).]

\(x_{c1}\). This peaking in \(\Delta C/T\) effect was absent from the scanning[6] of \(x_{c1}\) using pressure, where a _decrease_ in \(\Delta C/T\) was seen scanning "-downward" in composition from \(x\) = 0.022 using pressure, and no other previous experiments near \(x_{c1}\) combine to offer the fine scale on which Th concentration is varied here. Thus, previous data[20] for \(x\) = 0.019 show a peak in \(C/T\) within 3% in value of that measured[20] for \(x\) = 0.0172 vs a 74% difference in \(\Delta C/T\) (see Table 1) for the \(x\) = 0.0178 (\(\equiv\)\(x_{c1}\)) data compared to the \(x\) = 0.0170 data shown in Fig. 3. Also, as has been remarked on[12] before, purity has been seen to play a role in \(\Delta C\), especially for the lower transition for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\) where high purity U\({}_{0.97}\)Th\({}_{0.03}\)Be\({}_{13}\) showed[12] a \(\Delta C_{2}\)\({}^{-}\)1.5 that observed in samples with the purity in, e.g., Ref. [20]. Thus, the fact that peaking in \(\Delta C/T\) at \(x_{c1}\) has not been previously observed may also be partly due to the purity of the samples.

\(x_{c2}\). Despite a much coarser delineation in \(x\) in the previous combined low-temperature specific heat studies of U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{n}\)Be\({}_{13}\) near \(x_{c2}\) [\(x\) = 0.0378,[1, 20] 0.0433,[20] 0.052,[11] and 0.0603 (Ref. [1]) have been measured] compared to that in the present work, the peaking observed in \(\Delta C/T\) at \(x_{c2}\) in Fig. 4

Figure 3: Specific heat \(C\) divided by temperature \(T\) vs \(T\) for U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{n}\)Be\({}_{13}\) near \(x_{c1}\). Note (1) the “pinning” of \(T_{c}\) at approximately the same value for \(0.017\)\(<\)\(x\)\(\leq\) 0.0185 as remarked upon in Fig. 1, (2) the _increase_ of \(\Delta C\) for \(x\) decreasing from 0.022, in contradiction to pressure results (Ref. [6]), and (3) the lack of any increase in \(C\) for \(T\)\(<\)0.4 K with decreasing \(x\) below 0.022, again in contradiction to the pressure induced transition observed in Ref. [6]. Also, note the increased normal state \(C/T\) for \(x\) = 0.0178 and 0.0185 vs that for \(x\) = 0.017, as well as the broadened superconducting transitions for the former vs the latter. The slight anomaly at 0.34 K in the \(C/T\) data for \(x\) = 0.017 may be the thermodynamically posited fourth phase transition shown as a dashed line to the left of \(x_{c1}\) in Fig. 1 and discussed in the text. Measurements on \(x\) = 0.0174 are planned. The equal area construction method (Ref. [26]) for determining \(\Delta C\)[adel] is shown here for \(x\) = 0.01.

Figure 2: Cubic lattice parameter vs Th concentration in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{n}\)Be\({}_{13}\). These data show that the monotonic fine-tuning of the nominal composition near \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\) in fact succeeds in producing monotonic variation in the actual resulting composition. Compositions used in the text are the nominal ones, due to the inherent scatter in the x-ray results.

  at \(x\!=\!0.0455\) was already qualitatively evident in the discovery work[1] by Ott _et al._ In that work \(C_{\rm max}/T\) for \(x\!=\!0.0378\) for \(\Delta\,C_{2}\) (a weak upper transition was still observable) was 4.6 J/mol K\({}^{2}\), compared to 3.5 J/mol K\({}^{2}\) for \(x\!=\!0.0331\) in the same work, 3.5 J/mol K\({}^{2}\) for \(x\!=\!0.0433\) in Ref. 20 (vs 4.3 J/mol K\({}^{2}\) for \(x\!=\!0.043\) and 5.1 J/mol K\({}^{2}\) for \(x\!=\!0.0455\) reported here). The ability in the present work to see the precise point in the phase diagram (see Fig. 1) where the second transition first occurs (at \(x\!=\!0.043\), see Fig. 4) shows how rapidly as a function of \(x\) the behavior of U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) changes near \(x_{c2}\) (which would, given the proper composition, presumably also be the case for \(x\) near \(x_{c1}\)). What the present work also observes for \(x_{c2}\) which was not previously seen (also not in the present work at \(x_{c1}\)) and which may shed light on the nature of the superconducting critical point, is that the peak in \(\Delta\,C/T\) occurs _just before_ (see Fig. 4), as \(x\) approaches the region \(x_{c1}\!\!<\!\!x\!\!<\!\!x_{c2}\) from above, the second transition occurs at \(x\!=\!0.043\).

A question arises: is the peaking in \(\Delta\,C/T\) at \(x_{c1,2}\) due to an as of yet not understood physical phenomenon (possibly linked to the genesis of the second transition) or is it simply that the second transition seen for \(x_{c1}\!\!<\!\!x\!\!<\!\!x_{c2}\) has the same \(T_{c}\) at \(x_{c1}\) (\(x_{c2}\)) as the transition observed for \(x\!\!<\!\!x_{c1}\) (\(x\)\(>\!\!\!x_{c2}\)) and that the sum of the two \(\Delta\,C\)'s is large? In order to consider this question, consider the plot of \(\Delta\,C\) vs Th concentration in Fig. 5. Away from \(x_{c1,2}\), i.e., for \(0.022\!\approx\!\!x\)\(\approx\!\!\!\)\(\approx\!\!\)\(\approx\!\!\)\(\approx\!\!0.038\), one cannot extrapolate the sum \(\Delta\,C_{1}\!+\!\Delta\,C_{2}\) to come anywhere near \(\Delta\,C(x_{c1,2})\). As one approaches an \(x_{c}\) from within (without) \(x_{c1}\!\!<\!\!x\!\!<\!\!x_{c2}\), however, \(\Delta\,C_{2}\) (\(\Delta\,C\)) grows enormously with a \(\Delta\,x\) of only at most \(0.005\) (\(0.0008\)), where the correct limiting value for \(\Delta\,x\) for \(\Delta\,C_{2}\) is likely smaller than \(0.005\) as would be revealed by further experiments for \(x\!=\!0.0195\) and \(0.041\). Thus, something unusual, directly in the vicinity of \(x_{c1,2}\), appears to occur.

Why the lower transition \(\Delta\,C_{2}\) grows so sharply--just as the upper transition is splitting off at \(x\!=\!0.043\)--in comparison with \(\Delta\,C_{2}\) at \(x\!=\!0.038\) and why the single-transition region \(\Delta\,C\) also jumps as the two transition region is approached from either side is the central question arising from this work and the focus of the further discussion. We treat, in advance of more data in the exact vicinity of \(x_{c1}\) (at, e.g., \(x\!=\!0.0195\)), \(x_{c1}\) as similar to \(x_{c2}\) as regards the behavior observed for \(x\!=\!0.043\).[27] The early work of Ott _et al._ for \(x\)\(=\!0.0378\), where a very large \(\Delta\,C_{2}\) had a small \(\Delta\,C_{1}\) shoulder, is--in terms of the results of the present work--seemingly equivalent to our \(x\!=\!0.043\) or possibly to (as yet unmeasured) \(x\!\equiv\!0.041\). This sample dependence, already commented on above for samples near \(x_{c1}\) and discussed also in Ref. 12, makes it clear that the intercomparison of high quality samples--all prepared using the same starting materials and preparation techniques--is absolutely necessary for exploring the critical behavior near \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\). The changes observed in the consistently made samples in the present work--although startingly rapid at \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\)--all behave monotonically with \(x\). Further, the peaking behavior in \(\Delta\,C/T\) at \(x_{c1}\) is mirrored at \(x_{c2}\), on the scale of things a great distance away in composition.

## 4 Towards understanding the large \(d\Delta\,C/t\,x|x_{c}\)

If this large peaking in \(\Delta\,C/T\) at \(x_{c}\) is due to an as of yet unobserved phenomenon (which would have implications for the genesis of the second transition), then unusual behavior at \(x_{c1,2}\) should be observed in other superconducting _and_ normal state observable quantities. Conversely, the simple melding together of two transitions at a common \(T_{c}\) at \(x_{c1,2}\) to cause a large \(\Delta\,C\) would not produce sharp changes at \(x_{c1,2}\) in the other superconducting and normal state properties. Specific heat measurements lend themselves to a determination of an important normal state parameter \(\gamma\) proportional to the dressed density of states \(N(0)(1\!+\!\lambda)\). In addition, specific heat data allow the determination of an important measure of the strength of the coupling of the superconducting electrons, namely, \(\Delta\,C/\gamma T_{c}\), equal to 1.43 for a weak coupled BCS superconductor.

\(\gamma\). The discussion of the specific heat \(\gamma\) (\(\equiv\!C^{n}/T\) as \(T\!\rightarrow\!0\)) in UBe\({}_{13}\) and U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) is complicated by the fact that these materials--unlike most "nonheavy fermion" systems--are not Fermi liquids by 1 K. This means that \(C/T\), which is an indicator of the bare density of states at the

Figure 4: Specific heat divided by temperature vs temperature for U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), \(x\) near \(x_{c2}\). Note the shoulder above the large \(\Delta\,C\) for \(x\!=\!0.043\) which corresponds to the beginning of the presence of \(\Delta\,C_{1}\) in the double transition region of the phase diagram. Ac susceptibility confirms \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\) for \(x\!=\!0.043\) to be \(\sim\!\!0.56\) K. This very small \(\Delta\,C\) implies that, at least at \(x_{c2}\), \(\Delta\,C_{1}\!\!\rightarrow\!\!0\).

Figure 5: The jump in the specific heat at \(T_{c}\), \(\Delta\,C\), determined using the equal area construction (Ref. 26) vs Th concentration in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\). In the region \(x_{c1}\!\!<\!\!x\!\!<\!\!x_{c2}\) where there are two transitions, \(\Delta\,C_{1}\) (squares) and \(\Delta\,C_{2}\) (circles) as well as their sum (asterisks) are plotted separately. It is clear that \(\Delta\,C\) for \(x\!<\!\!x_{c1}\), as well as \(\Delta\,C\) for \(x\!>\!\!x_{c2}\), peaks as \(x\!\rightarrow\!\!x_{c}\) from outside \(x_{c1}\!\!\!<\!\!x\)\(<\!\!x_{c2}\), serving as a harbinger of the second transition. Note that \(\Delta\,C_{1}\!\!\rightarrow\!\!0\) as \(x\!\rightarrow\!\!x_{c2}\).

  Fermi energy \(N(0)\) times a factor \(1+\lambda\) which describes the electron interactions, is still changing as a function of temperature below 1 K. Thus, in U\({}_{0.97}\)Th\({}_{0.03}\)Be\({}_{13}\)\(C\)/\(T\)\(\equiv\) 1150 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) just above \(T_{c1}\) , and rises to \(C^{n}\)/\(T\)\(\equiv\) 2600 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) at \(T\)\(\rightarrow\)0 (see Table 1 and Ref. [12]). The determination of \(C^{n}\)/\(T\) below \(T_{c}\) can be carried out via measurements in magnetic field [12] to suppress the superconductivity or by matching the (measured) superconducting state entropy (\(S_{sc}\)=\(\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\)\(C^{sc}\)/\(T\)\(dT\)) with the extrapolated normal state entropy (\(S_{n}\)=\(\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\)\(C^{n}_{\rm extray}\)/\(T\)\(dT\)) under the assumption that the transition is second order, i.e., \(S_{sc}\)=\(S_{n}\) . Thus, _a priori_ there are two \(\gamma\)'s one can consider--the measured \(\gamma\) or more properly \(C\)/\(T\), above \(T_{c1}\) (here called \(\gamma\)*) and the linearly extrapolated, via entropy-matching determined \(\gamma\)=\(C^{n}\)/\(T\) as \(T\)\(\rightarrow\)0. These are listed in Table 1 and plotted in Fig. 6. As may be readily seen, the normal state \(\gamma\) (=\(C\)/\(T\) as \(T\)\(\rightarrow\)0) as well as \(C\)/\(T\)\(|_{T-T_{c1}^{+}}\)(= \(\gamma\)*) both show structure as \(x\) approaches the double transition region \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\). Since \(\gamma\) is a normal state property, this sharp structure at \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\) in \(\gamma\) is certainly consistent with the huge jumps in the specific heat at the superconducting transitions at \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\) being indicative of some underlying physical phenomenon and not just simply the crossing of two superconducting \(T_{c}\)(_x_) phase lines. Something is occurring in the _f_-electron density of states and/or with the electron interactions that is connected with the sharp peaking in \(\Delta\)\(C\) at \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\), after which, as \(x\) enters the region \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\) , two superconducting transitions appear. Obviously, a large \(\gamma\) implies a large entropy (\(S\)=\(\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\)C*/\(T\)\(dT\))--shown in Table 1. Thus, as \(\gamma\) peaks for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\) , so does the entropy (\(\Leftrightarrow\)\(f\)-electron degrees of freedom). This increase in entropy is of course necessary for (and probably connected to) the multiple large peaks in \(C^{\kappa\varsigma}\)/\(T\) observed for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\) . That the entropy rises already at \(x\)\(\sim\)0.02 is, as discussed above, connected with the suppression of the peak in \(C\) at 2.5 K in pure UBe\({}_{13}\) with Th doping. The jump in \(\gamma\) at \(x\) = 0.0178 (\(x_{c1}\)) occurs, however, before this 2.5 K peak is completely suppressed.[19] Thus, an exact correlation [16, 17] is lacking at \(x_{c1}\) , and of course this peak suppression is long since complete before the behavior at \(x_{c2}\) occurs.

\(\Delta\)\(C\)/\(\gamma\)\(T_{c}\) . Figure 7 shows \(\Delta\)\(C\)/\(\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\) vs \(x\) for U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), where \(\gamma\)*=\(C\)/\(T\)\(|_{T-T_{c}^{+}}\). This is the sensible choice, since the energy gap opens up in the dressed density of states present at \(T_{c}\) , not the eventual \(\gamma\) (=\(C^{n}\)/\(T\) as \(T\)\(\rightarrow\)0) that is obtained well below the superconducting transition. (Measurements[12] of the normal state in a 2 T applied magnetic field--low enough not to affect \(C\)/\(T\) above \(T_{c}\)(\(B\) = 0)--show indeed a continuing gradual increase in \(C\)/\(T\) with decreasing temperature, not a sudden jump in \(C\)/\(T\).) If we compare the values shown in Fig. 7 with the weak-coupling BCS result of \(\Delta\)\(C\)/\(\gamma\)\(T_{c}\)= 1.43, clearly the vicinity of \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\) in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) sees very strong coupling. (Even without using an idealized[26]\(\Delta\)\(C\) for an infinitely sharp transition, \(\Delta\)\(C\)/\(\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\) at \(x\) = 0.0455 is 3.1, far in excess of the BCS value.) In fact, the value for \(\Delta\)\(C\)/\(\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\) observed at \(x_{c2}\) is larger than seen in any other superconductor with the exception of UBe\({}_{12.97}\)B\({}_{0.03}\), where \(\Delta\)\(C\)/\(\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\) is also observed[28]--for an idealized transition--to be 4.4, although without any two transition region found in the phase diagram. The important implication to be drawn here from the data in Fig. 7 is, however, not the very strong coupling when compared to BCS but rather the sharp structure peaking at \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\) just as for \(\Delta\)\(C\) and \(\gamma\) discussed above. The large \(\Delta\)\(C\)/\(\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\) values themselves, if taking place[4, 5] in a non-BCS

Figure 6: \(\gamma\)(=\(C^{n}\)/\(T\) as \(T\)\(\rightarrow\)0) vs Th concentration (squares) as determined by linear extrapolation of \(C^{normal}\)/\(T\) below \(T_{c}\) to match the observed superconducting state entropy as discussed in the text. \(C^{n}\)/\(T\) at \(T_{c}^{+}\)(= \(\gamma\)*) is also shown plotted as triangles. The large difference between the two values at a given \(x\) is proof of the continuing evolution at low temperature of the dressed density of states in these materials. Note the sharp rise in both \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma\)* as \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c1\,2}\) from outside the double transition region. In the superconducting state for U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), in contrast with other superconductors, C*/\(T\) does not approach zero as \(T\)\(\rightarrow\)0, but rather has a remanent value \(\gamma_{\rm rest}\) , see Table 1 and Ref. [11]. This \(\gamma_{\rm rest}\) varies between 20–30 % of \(\gamma\) and has also been seen in Ref. [11]. If \(\gamma-\gamma_{\rm rest}\) is plotted (not shown), the data shown for \(\gamma\) are merely shifted downwards with no strong change in the observed structure at \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\) .

Figure 7: The discontinuity in the specific at \(T_{c}\) , \(\Delta\)\(C\), (\(\Delta\)\(C_{1}\) for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\)) determined via the equal area construction (Ref. [26]) divided by \(\gamma\)*=\(C\)/\(T\)\(|_{T-T_{c}^{+}}\) multiplied by \(T_{c}\) (in the single transition regimes) or \(T_{c1}\) (in the double transition regimes) vs Th concentrations in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\). The BCS value for weak coupling superconductors is 1.43. If \(\Delta\)\(C_{2}\)/\(\gamma\)\(T_{c2}\) were plotted at \(x\) = 0.043, or generally for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\) , the value for \(\gamma\)\({}^{\rm\gamma}\) used would be from \(C^{n}\)/\(T\) data above \(T_{c1}\) extrapolated down to \(T_{c2}\) using the entropy constraint. The resultant \(\Delta\)\(C_{2}\)/\(\gamma\)\({}^{\rm\gamma}\)\(T_{c2}\) at \(x\) = 0.043 is about 3.2, i.e., the fact that \(\Delta\)\(C_{2}\)/\(\gamma\)\({}^{\rm\gamma}\)\(T_{c}\) rises as \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c1}\) (from below) and \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c2}\) (from above), and then falls for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\)  is independent of what is used in the two transition region for \(\Delta\)\(C_{2}\)/\(\gamma\)\(T_{c}\) .

  superconductor, can first be quantitatively discussed only after the precise ground state is known.

## Conclusions and Future Work

It seems that the two phase region in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) for \(\sim\) 0.0178\(<\)\(x\)\(<\) 0.0455 is preceded on both the Th-richer and -poorer sides by enormous increases in the size of the specific heat jumps at the superconducting transition, in the size of \(\gamma\) (defined either as \(C/T\) at \(T\) = \(T_{c}^{+}\) or at \(T\)\(\rightarrow\) 0), and in the size of \(\Delta C/\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\) (\(\Leftrightarrow\) superconducting coupling strength). These facts taken together argue that such peaking at \(x_{c1,2}\) is not simply a crossing of \(T_{c}(x)\) phase lines of two transitions, but rather is more fundamental in nature. Considering now the central questions (type of superconductivity and why Th produces two transitions for \(x_{c_{1}}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\)) which this work was undertaken to try to answer, the extremely large \(\Delta C\) and \(\Delta C/\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\) for \(x\) approaching the two phase regime, where according to, e.g., pressure work [6] the lower transition for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\) corresponds to the large single transition for \(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c1}\), \(\triangleleft\) not appear consistent with BCS theory. The strong increase in \(\gamma\) and also \(\gamma\)* at \(x_{c1,2}\) (see Fig. 6) is consistent with some double resonance structure, with a shallow minimum between, in the dressed density of states moving through the Fermi energy as a function of increasing Th concentration such that the Fermi energy is between the two sharp peaks for \(x_{c1}\)\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c2}\). As we have discussed before, [12] one important difference between Th, which creates two separate transitions and, e.g., La, which does not, is the size of the peaks in \(N(0)(1\) + \(\lambda)\) caused by Th. For U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), \(\gamma\) (\(=\) \(C^{n}/T\) as \(T\) \(\rightarrow\) 0) exceeds 2.6 J/mol K\({}^{2}\)(see Table 1) while for U\({}_{1-x}\)La\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\), values of 'only' 1.5 J/mol K\({}^{2}\) are reached. [18]

Why and whether the genesis of the two transition region in U\({}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)Be\({}_{13}\) is linked to a non-BCS superconducting mechanism caused by large values of \(\gamma\) in \(\gamma\)(\(\approx\)\(N(0)\)(1 + \(\lambda)\)) as a function of \(x\) as \(x\) moves through \(x_{c1,2}\) provides an incentive for further experimental and theoretical work. Certainly the clues revealed here, that \(\Delta C\) and \(\Delta C/\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\) peak sharply at \(x_{c1,2}\), _before_ the two transition region occurs, should provide a helpful initial direction. Electron tunneling measurements on U\({}_{1-x_{c1,2}}\)Th\({}_{x_{c1,2}}\)Be\({}_{13}\) are planned to directly determine the energy gap, another indicator--in addition to \(\Delta C/\gamma\)*\(T_{c}\)--for the coupling strength.

Concerning the search [23] for a second transition for \(x\)\(<\)\(x_{c1}\) and \(x\)\(>\)\(x_{c2}\) [so that the thermodynamic structure of Yip, Li, and Kumar [21] (YLK) that three second order phase transition lines cannot meet at a point is obeyed as discussed above in the Introduction], the present work with all its fine gradations in Th concentration can offer only hints for further work. As seen in Fig. 3, there _may_ be a small second transition at 0.34 K below the large transition at 0.5 K in U\({}_{0.983}\)Th\({}_{0.017}\)Be\({}_{13}\). (Whether this small anomaly is related to the very large anomaly in the ultrasonic attenuation observed [7] at 0.36 K for \(x\) = 0.0175 is a question of how intercomparable the differing preparations are, as discussed above when comparing Ott's \(x\) = 0.0378 results with our \(x\) = 0.043 data.) This implies an almost vertical \(T_{c}(x)\) for this second transition--work at \(x\) = 0.0174 is planned. As discussed above, the YLK stricture can also be fulfilled in the special case that, in the two phase region, \(dT_{c1}/dx\) = \(dT_{c2}/dx\) as \(x\)\(\rightarrow\)\(x_{c}\). This, based on the present work, remains an open question at both \(x_{c1}\) and \(x_{c2}\). However, the last way to fulfill the YLK stricture (barring a first order phase transition), i.e., \(\Delta C_{1}\)\(\rightarrow\)0 before \(x_{c}\) is reached so that there are not three phase lines, seems to be consistent with the data (see Fig. 4 and 5) at \(x\) = 0.043 near \(x_{c2}\). Thus, to decide the thermodynamic behavior near \(x_{c1}\) requires further data on \(\Delta C\), for 0.0185\(<\)\(x\)\(<\)0.022, as well as the continuing search for the almost vertical phase line at \(x\) = 0.0174.
