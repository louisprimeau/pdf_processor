###### Abstract

The electronic phase diagram of PrFeAsO1-xFx (0 ≈ x ≈ 0.225) has been
determined using synchrotron x-ray powder-diffraction, magnetization,
and resistivity measurements. The structural transition temperature is
suppressed from 154 to ≈ 120 K and the magnetic phase transitions of
both iron and praseodymium ions are completely suppressed by x ≈ 0.08
fluorine doping, coinciding with the emergence of superconductivity. The
optimal doping is x ≈ 0.15 when T_(C)=47 K while the maximum solubility
of fluorine in PrFeAsO1-xFx is reached around x=0.22. The structural,
magnetic, and superconducting phase diagram is presented.

## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity in the oxypnictides _LnMPn_O (_Ln_ =
La-Nd, Sm, and Gd; M = Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru; _Pn_ = P and As) [1, 2, 3, 4]
and a ZrCuSiAs-type structure [5, 6] sets a milestone in the field of
superconductivity. The first step in the study of a discovered
superconductor and toward elucidation of the nature of superconductivity
itself is the determination of the phase diagram. It is natural then to
compare the pnictide phase diagram with that of the only other class of
high-temperature superconductors, the cuprates [7, 8, 9, 10]. As in the
cuprates, superconductivity arises when a so-called parent
nonsuperconducting compound is doped with charge carriers. It has been
demonstrated that the parent compound, _Ln_FeAsO, can be doped with
holes when _Ln_³⁺ is replaced partially by a divalent ion
(La_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO, [11] Pr_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO, [12] and Sr²⁺).
Correspondingly, _n_-type doping is realized either by substitution of
_Ln_³⁺ by a tetravalent ion [Gd${}_{x-\overline{\rm{Ti}}}$FeAsO (Ref.
13) and Th⁴⁺] or partially replacing O²⁻ by F⁻. Among the iron
pnictides, to date, the electron-doped (O_(1 − x)F_(x)) iron arsenides
_Ln_FeAsO1-xFx have the highest T_(C)’s reported. Until now, there have
been reports on the phase diagrams of _Ln_FeAsO1-xFx, _Ln_ = La, [10,
14, 15, 16, 17] Ce, [2, 7] Ce, [2, 27] Nd, [18] and Sm. [19, 20, 21]
Within the phase diagram of CeFeAsO1-xFx, Zhao _et al._[7] argue for a
suppression of the antiferromagnetism (AFM) with doping such that the
magnetic order vanishes in the close proximity to the superconductivity
(SC). This has been confirmed in other _Ln_FeAsO1-xFx systems [2, 7, 10,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Yet, in SmFeAsO1-xFx there are two of
coexistence of static AFM order with superconductivity [20, 21]. Also, a
signature of the Sm³⁺ ions’ magnetism has been reported in optimal
superconducting SmFeAsO0.85F0.15. [22] More recent studies on homolog
systems [10, 15, 16] report a rather _abrupt_ (first-orderlike) change
in the structural and magnetic-order parameters at the boundary of
superconductivity. Despite wide efforts toward a unified picture, a
consensus has not yet been reached. Without any doubt, the correctness
of the phase diagrams relies on an accurate determination of the
fluorine-ion concentration [23, 10]. In this paper, we use synchrotron
x-ray scattering, magnetization, and resistivity measurements to map the
structural, magnetic, and superconducting phase diagram of the less
studied PrFeAsO1-xFx.

## II Experimental Procedure

PrFeAsO1-xFx polycrystalline samples were synthesized through a two-step
standard high-temperature solid-state chemical reaction using
stoichiometric amounts of PrAs, Fe (4NN), Fe2O3 (5N), and PrF3 (4N) as
starting materials [3, 19]. The PrAs binary used in the final reaction
was synthesized by reacting Pr (3N) and As (4N) powders. The Pr:As = 1
:1 mix was encapsulated within a tantalum tube that was sealed inside a
quartz tube under a low-pressure Ar atmosphere, slowly heated to 500
^(∘)C, and held at that temperature for 5 h. The powder was ground,
mixed, resealed, and heated again to 900 ^(∘)C for 10 h. The
stoichiometric constituents were then thoroughly ground, mixed, and
finally pressed into pellets using a cold isostatic press with a
pressure of 0.38 GPa. To avoid direct contact with the quartz tube and
possible Si contamination, the pellets were wrapped in tantalum foil
before being sealed under a low atmosphere of Ar gas in quartz tubes.
They were heated to 1150 ^(∘)C for 50 h. All preparatory steps except
the annealing were performed in a glovebox under a high-purity Ar-gas
atmosphere. The single phase was checked after each step using x-ray
diffraction (XRD) with Cu _K_α radiation at room temperature. A
discrepancy between the nominal and real fluorine content has been
systematically reported in homolog systems [10, 23]. Therefore we
determined the actual fluorine concentration by wavelength-dispersive
x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) for each concentration. Therefore, all fluorine
concentrations reported in this paper are the as-measured values and not
the nominal starting compositions. Figure 1 shows the actual
fluorine-doping _x_(WDS) as measured by WDS versus the initial (nominal)
concentration. As pointed by Ref. 23, the actual doping of the primary
phase is less than nominal (Fig. 1) because of fluorine incorporation in
secondary phases, for mation of volatile components and absorbtion from
the tantalum wrapping foil and quartz tube. Resistivity, dc- and
ac-susceptibility measurements down to 1.8 K were performed using a
Quantum Design physical property measurements system. Electrical
contacts with the samples for resistivity measurements were made using
Pelco colloidal silver paste through attaching thin gold wires in a
four-probe configuration.

The silver paste was cured at 100 ^(∘)C for up to 30 min in order to
avoid sample degradation. The excitation current of 2 mA was optimized
for the best signal-to-noise ratio and to prevent overheating of the
samples by checking the linear _I-V_ characteristics. Because the
absolute values of the resistivity data carry an uncertainty of up to 30

## III Results and Discussion

The parent PrFeAsO antiferromagnetic semimetal crystalizes in a P4/_mm_
tetragonal structure at high temperatures but undergoes a (_Cmma_)
orthorhombic transformation at low temperatures,24 which is
characteristic of all _Ln_FeAsO systems. In order to obtain insight into
the evolution of the crystallographic structure with fluorine doping and
its relevance for superconductivity, we performed synchrotron x-ray
powder-diffraction measurements on the undoped parent PrFeAsO, two
nonsuperconducting samples x = 0.059 and 0.078, and one underdoped
superconducting concentration with x = 0.082.

Figure 2 shows 2_th_ scans through the (2 2 0)_T_ Bragg peak of the
high-temperature P4/_mmm_ tetragonal structure. The peak broadens and
splits into the (4 0 0)_O_ and (0 4 0)_O_ peaks of the _Cmma_
orthorhombic phase upon cooling. "T" and "O" subscripts denote
tetragonal and orthorhombic, respectively. The corresponding structural
transition temperatures found within +-2 K resolution are _T_S = 154 K
for the parent, _T_S = 142 K for x = 0.059, and _T_S = 120 K for the
fluorine doping preceding superconductivity x = 0.078.

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the (2 2 0) Bragg peak for the
superconducting x = 0.082 sample upon cooling to 50 K. The full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of the peak is plotted versus temperature in the
inset of Fig. 3 and shows a continuous evolution down to 50 K. Upon
cooling, we observe a continuous slight broadening of the (2 2 0) peak;
yet

we were not able to resolve any definite inflection point in the FWHM
versus T indicative of a signature of the tetragonal to orthorhombic
structural phase transition.[7] Therefore, our data support a picture of
a rather abrupt suppression of the orthorhombic phase at the boundary of
superconductivity. Our best estimate is a complete suppression of
_T_(S)_ from 120 K within 2.5

Now we turn to our magnetic-susceptibility data. Figure 4 shows the
temperature-dependent dc magnetic susceptibility of PrFeAsO measured in
200 Oe fitted above the Pr ordering temperature with a Curie-Weiss law,
_kh_(_T_) = _kh_0 + _C_/(_T_ + _th_), where _kh_0 is the
temperature-independent susceptibility, C = _N_m__(eff)²/3_k_g is the
Curie constant, N is the number of Pr3+ ions, and _th_ is the
Curie-Weiss temperature. The effective moment found is _m__(eff)/_z_ =
3.75_m__(B), slightly larger than the isolated trivalent Pr-ion value of
3.58_m__(B).[25] The discrepancy could be due to the Pr3+ crystalline
electric field contribution to the susceptibility.[26] It should be
noted that the susceptibility data could be fitted with a Curie-Weiss
law for _Ln_FeAsO1-F,F, _Ln_ = Ce,[27]^(,)[27], Nd,[27] and Gd (Ref.
[13]) but not in the case of _Ln_ = Sm.[28] The low-temperature
susceptibility is dominated by a sharp peak around 12 K in the pure
PrFeAsO system, as well as in all other nonsuperconducting F-
concentrations. This is due to the AFM ordering (Neel temperature) of
the Pr 4f electrons [Fig. 6(b)], consistent with previous reports from
neutron,[24] magnetization,[27] and resistivity[27, 29] studies. The
upper inset shows a moderated suppression of _T_N(Pr) with fluorine
doping for three different concentrations x = 0, 0.059, and 0.078 in
PrFeAsO1-F, extending over the whole nonsuperconducting region. In the
lower inset the temperature derivative of the susceptibility around the
ordering temperature is shown. Again, it should be noted that there is a
weak to moderate suppression of the ordering temperature with fluorine
doping.

Figure 5 presents the real components of the ac susceptibilities
normalized to their corresponding maxima for the same compositions (_x_
= 0, 0.059, 0.78) discussed previously. The 130 K sharp peak in
magnetization of the parent compound coincides with the
magnetic-ordering temperature of the iron-ion moments, as initially
revealed by the neutron-diffraction data.[24] With fluorine doping, the
magnetic-ordering temperature of the iron moments is continuously
reduced from 130 (_x_ = 0) to 80 K for x = 0.078.

In Fig. 6 we show resistivity data for PrFeAsO1-F,F with x = 0, 0.044,
0.11, 0.138, and 0.225 divided by the room-temperature value, _r_(297
K). The data are shifted for clarity. The behavior of _r_(_T_) for the
PrFeAsO compound is similar to that of the other _Ln_FeAsO, _Ln_ = La,
Ce, Nd, and Sm.[19, 27] Upon cooling, the resistivity decreases showing
metallic behavior. Around 150 K there is a broad peak associated with
both the structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic
symmetry and the spin-density-wave magnetic

phase transition. Because of a smooth and continuous change in the
physical properties around these transitions, an indicator of the
transition temperature is the temperature derivative of the
resistivity.[10, 16, 27, 30] Figures 6(c) and 6(d) show ∂ρ/∂T for the x
= 0 and 0.044 nonsuperconducting samples. T_(X)(Fe) and T_(S) correspond
to the two inflection points in ∂ρ/∂T. At around 13 K, the resistivity
of the parent PrFeAsO exhibits a shoulderlike feature [Fig. 6(b)] that
was attributed to the AFM ordering of the Pr-ion moments.[27, 29]

Figure 7 shows the phase diagram of PrFeAsO1-x-x (0 <= x <= 0.225) as
determined by the measurements reported in this paper. Superconductivity
appears after doping with charge carriers (electrons) the parent AFM
semimetal PrFeAsO. In this system, doping is realized by substituting
O2- by F-. Upon doping, the coupled structural and AFM transitions are
suppressed, in analogy with the behavior of the structural and magnetic
transitions in La2-xSr_(x)CuO₄.[31] The phase diagram showing close
proximity between AFM and SC resembles that of the electron-doped
cuprates where the AFM persists right up to the SC dome. The
superconducting transition temperatures were determined by the onset of
the diamagnetism in zero-field-cooled magnetization (data not shown) or
the drop of the resistivity. Optimal doping is achieved at a fluorine
concentration of =0.15, in agreement with values reported for the
homologous systems CeFeAsO1-x,Fx (Refs. 2 and 7) and SmFeAsO1-x,Fx
(Refs. 3, 19, and 21) and as predicted by recent minimum
principle-energy calculations.[32]LnFeAsO1-_δ_ oxygen deficient
(optimally doped at _δ_=0.15) with no fluorine doping obtained by
high-pressure synthesis has been reported to be a superconductor,[33]
this process is similar to the well-known oxygenation of the cuprates.
It is worthwhile to mention that a maximum superconducting temperature
transition around 47 K has been reported previously for optimally doped
samples synthesized by normal pressure solid-state chemical reaction[29,
54] while a slightly enhanced T_(C) of 52 K was reported for the samples
synthesized using a high-pressure method.[4] Our results show that the
synthesis of a sample with nominal fluorine concentration of 0.35
resulted in an actual fluorine _x_WDS substitution of 0.225, which
represents the maximum fluorine doping in PrFeAsO1-x.Fx. This value is
consistent with recently reported WDS determined values in LaFeAsO1-x
and SmFeAsO1-x,Fx (Ref. 23) and the saturation of lattice parameters in
LaFeAsO1-x.Fx.[55]

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we have determined the complete structural, magnetic, and
superconducting phase diagram of PrFeAsO1-x,Fx (0 <= x <= 0.22) using
synchrotron x-ray powder-diffraction, magnetization, and resistivity
measurements. We find a progressive suppression of the structural
transition and magnetic-ordering transitions of both iron- and
praseodymium-ion moments with increasing fluorine doping. In
superconducting samples, near the edge of the emergence of the
superconductivity (_x_ = 0.08 fluorine doping), we were not able to
detect any fraction of the orthogonal phase. The optimal doping was
found to be at x   0.15 when T_(C) = 47 K, and the maximum fluorine
doping in PrFeAsO1-x,Fx was reached around x = 0.22 with
superconductivity remaining robust.

The phase diagram is most similar to that of the hole-doped cuprates
La2-xSrCuO4.[31] However, there are some important differences. First,
in La2-xSrCuO4 there is a spin-glass phase in between the
three-dimensional Neel antiferromagnet and the superconductor; the
stripelike spin fluctuations in the cuprate spin-glass phase are rotated
by 45^(∘), relative to those in the superconductor and the spin-glass
superconductor transition at 0 K as a function of hole concentration is
first order. Second, the tetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition
temperature in La2-xSrCuO4 varies smoothly across the insulating to
superconductor boundary and, indeed, persists in x beyond the value at
which T_(C) is a maximum. By contrast, in the PrFeAsO1-x system both the
Neel order and the tetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition appear
to vanish together quite rapidly, possibly in a first-order way, as the
fluorine concentration is varied through the critical value for
superconductivity. In order to elucidate this further it will be
necessary to prepare homogeneous samples in which the fluorine
concentration, x, is varied in quite fine steps. This will represent a
significant technical challenge. It will also be necessary to
characterize the magnetism in samples in the transition region using
both neutron scattering and a local technique such as muon-spin
resonance. Of course, the ultimate goal is to determine which features
are universal and which are details of a particular system.
Specifically, one would like to determine whether or not the iron
pnictides and the cuprates are in the same universality class or
whether, in fact, the similarity in the phase diagrams is coincidental.
