###### Abstract

The degrees of hydrogenation in V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si were determined. The effects of hydrogen on the superconducting transition temperature _T_c, the lattice parameter, and the pressure dependence of _T_c were measured. The results will be discussed and compared with those of other hydrogenated and radiation damaged A15 compounds.

## 1 Introduction

The influence of defects on the properties of high-temperature A15 superconductors has been an active area of research in the past few years.1 Independent of their origins, defects are found to cause a universal degradation2,3 of the superconducting transition temperature _T_c, an expansion3 of the lattice parameter a0 and the removal4,5 of the normal-state anomalies which are often characteristics of a high-_T_c superconductor. Because of the reversible effects of irradiation, studies on the irradiated compounds have provided valuable data correlating the universal _T_c degradation with the reduction in long-range order1,2 and the subsequent modifications6,7 in the electron band structure due to defects. Unfortunately, the high level of radioactivity of the irradiated samples has made difficult the experiments from which microscopic information can be extracted. As a result, our current understanding1 of the defect effect on high-temperature superconductivity remains macroscopic.

Recently, quite similar to defects introduced by irradiation, hydrogen was found to generate reversibly a large reduction of _T_c and an expansion of a0 in Nb3Sn (Ref. 4) and Nb3Ge (Ref. 8), and the arrest of the low-temperature structural transformation in the former.4 In view of the nonradioactive nature of and the locatability of the H atom in a hydrogenated compound, a systematic study on the hydrogenated A15 compounds is particularly appealing. Therefore we have investigated the hydrogenation in V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si. Due to the lower atomic number V, these V-based hydrogenated A15 compounds are more suitable than the Nb-based ones for our future near-edge x-ray absorption study9 where the role of local symmetry recently suggested10 in high-temperature superconductivity can be evaluated and the microscopic information about the electronic structure of the compounds obtained.

We have found that: (1) Under our experimental conditions, the maximum hydrogen uptakes in V3Ga are ~ 38 and ~ 140 times those in V3Ge and V3Si, respectively; (2) a large _T_c suppression occurs in V3Ga and V3Ge but not in V3Si; and (3) the pressure coefficient of _T_c of V3Ga is independent of the H concentration. A hydride phase in V3Ga is also suggested in the high H concentration region. The results will be discussed and the effects of hydrogenation and irradiation compared.

## 2 Experimental

The starting A15 compounds of V3M with M = Ga, Ge, and Si were prepared by arc melting the constituents in an argon atmosphere many times to enhance the homogeneity. For V3Ga, the total weight loss was determined to be 0.8% after arc melting. This was attributed mainly to the loss of Ga, corresponding to a reduction of the quoted nominal value of 1 by 0.024. However, no weight loss was detected for V3Ge and V3Si. X-ray examinations revealed single phase in all samples investigated within our resolution (<=5%). No metallographic analysis was made to determine the homogeneity of the samples. They were then annealed in vacuum at 750deg C for 25 h prior to hydrogenation. The superconducting transition width was ~0.05 K for all three unhydrogenated samples and the onset temperatures of the transition were 15.3, 6.1, and 16.1 K for V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si, respectively. V3_M_H_x were obtained by heating the V3M up to 600deg C for 12 h and then cooling slowly to room temperature in a hydrogen atmosphere with pressure up to 150 bar. A quartz chamber was used for pressure less than ~11 bar and a stainless-steel chamber for higher pressure. Two other methods were also employed for preparing V3SiH_x_ by dipping the V3Si in a 50% HF or a 30% HNO3 aqueous solution and by electrolytic charging. To determine the hydrogen concentration, V3_M_H_x was heated at 450deg C for 10 h in a small quartz tube connected to a 500-ml quartz container at room temperature. Both the quartz tube and container were evacuated prior to heating. The amount of hydrogen so desorbed was then measured with a mass spectrometer against three hydrogen calibrators with three different known pressures. The uncertainty of x in V3_M_H_x was estimated at +- 10% of x. The x so determined represented the lower limit of hydrogen concentration, although the superconducting onset temperature accompanying with a broader transition (~0.5 K) was recovered after the hydrogen desorption.

The lattice parameter a0 was determined with a Debye-Scherrer camera using the Cu K a radiation. The uncertainty in a0 was obtained to be +-0.001 A by a cos2_th_ extrapolation. The superconducting transition was detected by a standard ac inductance bridge operating at 28 Hz. The temperature was determined by a Ge thermometer. High-pressure measurements were carried out by a self-clamp technique11 with a 1:1 _n_-pentane and isoamyl alcohol solution. The pressure at low temperature was determined by a superconducting Pb manometer.

## III Results

Within our experimental ranges, the amount of hydrogen in V3_M_H_x was found to increase with the temperature and the hydrogen pressure at which hydrogenation took place. The maximum _x_'s in V3_M_H_x obtained by heating V3M at 580deg C under 150 bar of H2 atmosphere (our maximum temperature and pressure for hydrogenation) for M = Ga, Ge, and Si are 1.96, 0.054, and 0.014 corresponding to 32.9, 1.39, and 0.35 at.%, respectively. In general, the introduction of hydrogen to V3M suppresses _T_c and enlarges a0. No change is evident in the basic A15 symmetry in V3_M_H_x to our maximum x.

In Fig. 1, _T_c is shown as a function of both x and a0 for V3_GaH_x, where the solid and dashed vertical bars represent the transition widths, respectively, during H charging and discharging, the upper horizontal bars the uncertainties in a0 and the lower horizontal bars the uncertainties in x. As displayed in Fig. 1, for x < 0.4, _T_c decreases rapidly and almost linearly at a rate of 0.7 K / [H] (at. %), with increasing x and a0. For x > 1.4 no superconductivity was detected down to 1.5 K. We found it extremely difficult to obtain samples with 0.4 < x < 1.4 on H2 charging. However, a sample with a _T_c = 2.6 K and x = 1.04 was prepared during H2 discharging by heating the V3GaH1,92 compound in vacuum at ~100deg C for 0.5 h. No effort of ours succeeded both during H2 charging and discharging to achieve 0.4 < x < 1.04. The x-ray diffraction patterns of the V3GaH_x do not exhibit any line broadening, suggesting the homogeneity of the hydrogenation. The increase in the superconducting width may be attributed to the local strain in the sample due to the H2-induced lattice expansion, since a nonhydrostatic pressure is known to have a large detrimental effect12 on the _T_c of high-_T_c A15 compounds. The a0 was found to vary linearly with x as shown in Fig. 2, from which the gap for 0.4 < x < 1.04 was clearly evident. The vertical and horizontal bars stand for the uncertainties in a0 and x, respectively. The x and a0

  dependencies of T_{\epsilon} for V_{\rm J}GeH_{\rm x} are given in Fig. 3, where the notations used are similar to those in Fig. 1. For the case of V_{\rm J}SiH_{\rm x}, no shift of T_{\epsilon} beyond our experimental resolution of \pm 0.005 K was detected at the maximum x of 0.014 together with an a_{0} expansion of 0.002 A.

The pressure effects on the T_{\epsilon} of three V_{\rm J}GaH_{\rm x} were determined up to 18 kbar. At atmospheric pressure, their T_{\epsilon}'s are, respectively, 15.3, 9.9, and 8.1 K for x = 0, 0.24, and 0.37. The pressure-induced shifts in T_{\epsilon} are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of pressure. It is clear to see that pressure enhances the T_{\epsilon} at a rate of 0.81 x 10^{-5} K bar^{-1} for all samples investigated, independent of x.

## IV Discussion

For later comparison, we have summarized in Table 1 some data on the hydrogenated and irradiated V_{\rm J}Ga, V_{\rm J}Ge, V_{\rm J}Si, Nb_{\rm J}Ge, and Nb_{\rm J}Sn.

In spite of the close similarity among V_{\rm J}Ga, V_{\rm J}Ge, and V_{\rm J}Si, there exists a large variation in the amounts of hydrogen that can dissolve in these compounds under the same conditions. For instance, the maximum x's obtained in V_{\rm J}GaH_{\rm x} are \sim -38 and \sim 140 times those in V_{\rm J}GeH_{\rm x} and V_{\rm J}SiH_{\rm x}, respectively, under the most favorable conditions of ours. Therefore, the susceptibility S of these compounds to hydrogenation decreases in the order of V_{\rm J}Ga, V_{\rm J}Ge, and V_{\rm J}Si. Earlier, it was noticed[8] that hydrogenation took place much more easily in Nb_{\rm J}Ge than in Nb_{\rm J}Sn. As shown in Table 1 we find that such a trend of S variation is also followed by the rate of percentage increase of a_{0} due to hydrogenation in both the V- and Nb-based systems; i.e., S increases as \Delta a_{0}/a_{0} per at. % of H absorbed increases. In other words, it is easier to dissolve an H atom in an A15 compound when the lattice of this compound opens

  up more readily to accomodate the large H atom. This seems to be consistent with the observation that S is larger for V3M with larger a0 as shown in Table I. Unfortunately, such a _S_-_a_0 correlation is no longer valid for Nb3Ge and Nb3Sn. Since the tetrahedral sites are less closely packed than the octahedral sites in an A15 structure, the former are more likely to be occupied by the dissolved H atoms. It is also clear from Table I that the a0 increase rate induced by a or n irradiation also varies in the same fashion as that induced by hydrogenation. In view of the metallurgical difficulties involved in preparing a stoichiometry and defect free V3Ga or Nb3Ge, the large susceptibility of hydrogenation or irradiation induced defect formation may be associated with the high metastability of the compounds. Whether the large S is caused by the enhanced trapping8 of H or by the inherent defects of a metastable compound is yet to be proved. In this respect, it should be noted that the rate of _n_-induced _T_c degradation was previously observed to increase continuously in V3Ga_{x}(Ref. [13]) for x varying from <1 to >1, but to pass a maximum1 in Nb3Al_{x} and Nb3Pt_{x} at x = 1. No correlation of S with _T_c or a0 of the unhydrogenated A15 compounds was found. The extreme difficulty to obtain x between 0.4 and 1.4 in V3GaH_{x} (see Fig. 2) leads us to the suggestion of the possible existence of a hydride phase.

As shown in Table I the rate of _T_c suppression by hydrogen at the low-concentration region is about the same for the hydrogenated V3Ga, V3Ge, Nb3Ge, and Nb3Sn ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 K/[H] (at.%). However, no _T_c shift larger than +-0.005 K was detected in V3SiH_{x}. While it is true that the maximum x in V3SiH_{x} is only 0.014 (corresponding to 0.35 at.%), a _T_c reduction of 0.14 K would have been expected, even based on a rate of 0.4 K/[H] (at.%). Our observation is consistent with the earlier suggestion7 that the _T_c of a relatively stable and defect free V3Si is rather insensitive to the initial drop in the density of states at the Fermi energy due to the shortening of the electron lifetime resulting from the electron-imperfection scattering. A specific-heat experiment to determine if the electron density of states of V3SiH_{0.014} is indeed drastically suppressed with its _T_c unaffected is currently planned.

Studies on defected A15 high-_T_c compounds except Mo3Ge (Ref. [14]), which has a very low density of states, have revealed two simple universal _T_c-_a_0(Ref. [15]) and _T_c-RR3[resistivity ratio (RR)] correlations; i.e., _T_c increases with a0 decrease and RR increase, independent of the origin of defects which causes the changes in a0 and RR. According to these correlations, pressure should always enhance _T_c and the rate of _T_c enhancement should be larger for samples with lower _T_c. However, study16 on the sputtered Nb-Ge thin films with a wide range of _T_c, caused by varying the deposition conditions of the films, yields results in complete defiance of the predictions; i.e., pressure always suppresses _T_c at a decreasing rate with _T_c decrease. Although we have observed in the present investigation that pressure always enhances _T_c of V3GaH_{x}, the rate of _T_c enhancement remains unexpectedly constant, independent of x (see Fig. 4). This confirms the suggestion16 that defects do not affect _T_c through the accompanying volume expansion. It also demonstrates that, in spite of the insensitivity of the _T_c degradation to the origin of imperfections, differentiation does exist between imperfections introduced by hydrogenation and variation in sample preparation conditions. In fact, insofar as the annealing recovery of _T_c is concerned, the _T_c degradation of the hydrogenated and irradiated compounds is reversible, whereas that of the compounds prepared under conditions other than optimum are not. For instance, one has not been able to raise the low _T_c of a defected Nb3Ge sample prepared under nonoptimal conditions. To understand such difference is one of the most challenging problems in the study of high-_T_c compounds. Further study on defected samples due to hydrogenation and irradiation will be very helpful. Preliminary investigation17 on the near edge _x_-ray absorption of V3GaH_{x} seems to indicate that, within the experimental resolution of a few eV, large electronic structure changes occur only in V sites but not in Ga sites.

## V Conclusion

We have studied the hydrogenation in V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si. The susceptibility S to hydrogenation was found to decrease rapidly in the order of V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si. At the same time, S increases with increasing rate of the a0 expansion due to hydrogenation. The same is true for the hydrogenated Nb3Ge and Nb3Sn. The large S may be related to the high metastability of the compounds. The irradiation induced a0-expansion rate varies with compounds in the same fashion as the hydrogenation induced rate of a0 expansion. The results of this study also suggest the possible existence of a hydride phase of V3GaH_{x} for x  1.4.

Although hydrogen was found to rapidly suppress the _T_c of V3Ga and V3Ge, no effect was detected in V3Si. This is consistent with the suggestion that _T_c of a nearly perfect V3Si depends less sensitively on the electron density of states at the Fermi energy. Specific-heat measurements on V3SiH_{x} are planned.

The pressure was found to enhance the _T_c of V3GaH_{x} at a constant rate, independent of x although the accompanying _T_c ranges from 8.1 to 15.3 K. The reason is still unknown. However, comparison of the present results with those on the Nb-Ge sputtered thin films suggests that defects due to hydrogenation and irradiation may play a different role in high  temperature superconductivity from those due to the variation in sample preparation conditions. A near edge x-ray-absorption investigation to assess the role of hydrogen in V_{3}Ga is currently under way. Preliminary results indicate that changes occur only at the V sites.

###### Abstract

The degrees of hydrogenation in V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si were determined. The effects of hydrogen on the superconducting transition temperature _T_c, the lattice parameter, and the pressure dependence of _T_c were measured. The results will be discussed and compared with those of other hydrogenated and radiation damaged A15 compounds.

## 1 Introduction

The influence of defects on the properties of high-temperature A15 superconductors has been an active area of research in the past few years.1 Independent of their origins, defects are found to cause a universal degradation2,3 of the superconducting transition temperature _T_c, an expansion3 of the lattice parameter a0 and the removal4,5 of the normal-state anomalies which are often characteristics of a high-_T_c superconductor. Because of the reversible effects of irradiation, studies on the irradiated compounds have provided valuable data correlating the universal _T_c degradation with the reduction in long-range order1,2 and the subsequent modifications6,7 in the electron band structure due to defects. Unfortunately, the high level of radioactivity of the irradiated samples has made difficult the experiments from which microscopic information can be extracted. As a result, our current understanding1 of the defect effect on high-temperature superconductivity remains macroscopic.

Recently, quite similar to defects introduced by irradiation, hydrogen was found to generate reversibly a large reduction of _T_c and an expansion of a0 in Nb3Sn (Ref. 4) and Nb3Ge (Ref. 8), and the arrest of the low-temperature structural transformation in the former.4 In view of the nonradioactive nature of and the locatability of the H atom in a hydrogenated compound, a systematic study on the hydrogenated A15 compounds is particularly appealing. Therefore we have investigated the hydrogenation in V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si. Due to the lower atomic number V, these V-based hydrogenated A15 compounds are more suitable than the Nb-based ones for our future near-edge x-ray absorption study9 where the role of local symmetry recently suggested10 in high-temperature superconductivity can be evaluated and the microscopic information about the electronic structure of the compounds obtained.

We have found that: (1) Under our experimental conditions, the maximum hydrogen uptakes in V3Ga are ~ 38 and ~ 140 times those in V3Ge and V3Si, respectively; (2) a large _T_c suppression occurs in V3Ga and V3Ge but not in V3Si; and (3) the pressure coefficient of _T_c of V3Ga is independent of the H concentration. A hydride phase in V3Ga is also suggested in the high H concentration region. The results will be discussed and the effects of hydrogenation and irradiation compared.

## 2 Experimental

The starting A15 compounds of V3M with M = Ga, Ge, and Si were prepared by arc melting the constituents in an argon atmosphere many times to enhance the homogeneity. For V3Ga, the total weight loss was determined to be 0.8% after arc melting. This was attributed mainly to the loss of Ga, corresponding to a reduction of the quoted nominal value of 1 by 0.024. However, no weight loss was detected for V3Ge and V3Si. X-ray examinations revealed single phase in all samples investigated within our resolution (<=5%). No metallographic analysis was made to determine the homogeneity of the samples. They were then annealed in vacuum at 750deg C for 25 h prior to hydrogenation. The superconducting transition width was ~0.05 K for all three unhydrogenated samples and the onset temperatures of the transition were 15.3, 6.1, and 16.1 K for V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si, respectively. V3_M_H_x were obtained by heating the V3M up to 600deg C for 12 h and then cooling slowly to room temperature in a hydrogen atmosphere with pressure up to 150 bar. A quartz chamber was used for pressure less than ~11 bar and a stainless-steel chamber for higher pressure. Two other methods were also employed for preparing V3SiH_x_ by dipping the V3Si in a 50% HF or a 30% HNO3 aqueous solution and by electrolytic charging. To determine the hydrogen concentration, V3_M_H_x was heated at 450deg C for 10 h in a small quartz tube connected to a 500-ml quartz container at room temperature. Both the quartz tube and container were evacuated prior to heating. The amount of hydrogen so desorbed was then measured with a mass spectrometer against three hydrogen calibrators with three different known pressures. The uncertainty of x in V3_M_H_x was estimated at +- 10% of x. The x so determined represented the lower limit of hydrogen concentration, although the superconducting onset temperature accompanying with a broader transition (~0.5 K) was recovered after the hydrogen desorption.

The lattice parameter a0 was determined with a Debye-Scherrer camera using the Cu K a radiation. The uncertainty in a0 was obtained to be +-0.001 A by a cos2_th_ extrapolation. The superconducting transition was detected by a standard ac inductance bridge operating at 28 Hz. The temperature was determined by a Ge thermometer. High-pressure measurements were carried out by a self-clamp technique11 with a 1:1 _n_-pentane and isoamyl alcohol solution. The pressure at low temperature was determined by a superconducting Pb manometer.

## III Results

Within our experimental ranges, the amount of hydrogen in V3_M_H_x was found to increase with the temperature and the hydrogen pressure at which hydrogenation took place. The maximum _x_'s in V3_M_H_x obtained by heating V3M at 580deg C under 150 bar of H2 atmosphere (our maximum temperature and pressure for hydrogenation) for M = Ga, Ge, and Si are 1.96, 0.054, and 0.014 corresponding to 32.9, 1.39, and 0.35 at.%, respectively. In general, the introduction of hydrogen to V3M suppresses _T_c and enlarges a0. No change is evident in the basic A15 symmetry in V3_M_H_x to our maximum x.

In Fig. 1, _T_c is shown as a function of both x and a0 for V3_GaH_x, where the solid and dashed vertical bars represent the transition widths, respectively, during H charging and discharging, the upper horizontal bars the uncertainties in a0 and the lower horizontal bars the uncertainties in x. As displayed in Fig. 1, for x < 0.4, _T_c decreases rapidly and almost linearly at a rate of 0.7 K / [H] (at. %), with increasing x and a0. For x > 1.4 no superconductivity was detected down to 1.5 K. We found it extremely difficult to obtain samples with 0.4 < x < 1.4 on H2 charging. However, a sample with a _T_c = 2.6 K and x = 1.04 was prepared during H2 discharging by heating the V3GaH1,92 compound in vacuum at ~100deg C for 0.5 h. No effort of ours succeeded both during H2 charging and discharging to achieve 0.4 < x < 1.04. The x-ray diffraction patterns of the V3GaH_x do not exhibit any line broadening, suggesting the homogeneity of the hydrogenation. The increase in the superconducting width may be attributed to the local strain in the sample due to the H2-induced lattice expansion, since a nonhydrostatic pressure is known to have a large detrimental effect12 on the _T_c of high-_T_c A15 compounds. The a0 was found to vary linearly with x as shown in Fig. 2, from which the gap for 0.4 < x < 1.04 was clearly evident. The vertical and horizontal bars stand for the uncertainties in a0 and x, respectively. The x and a0

  dependencies of T_{\epsilon} for V_{\rm J}GeH_{\rm x} are given in Fig. 3, where the notations used are similar to those in Fig. 1. For the case of V_{\rm J}SiH_{\rm x}, no shift of T_{\epsilon} beyond our experimental resolution of \pm 0.005 K was detected at the maximum x of 0.014 together with an a_{0} expansion of 0.002 A.

The pressure effects on the T_{\epsilon} of three V_{\rm J}GaH_{\rm x} were determined up to 18 kbar. At atmospheric pressure, their T_{\epsilon}'s are, respectively, 15.3, 9.9, and 8.1 K for x = 0, 0.24, and 0.37. The pressure-induced shifts in T_{\epsilon} are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of pressure. It is clear to see that pressure enhances the T_{\epsilon} at a rate of 0.81 x 10^{-5} K bar^{-1} for all samples investigated, independent of x.

## IV Discussion

For later comparison, we have summarized in Table 1 some data on the hydrogenated and irradiated V_{\rm J}Ga, V_{\rm J}Ge, V_{\rm J}Si, Nb_{\rm J}Ge, and Nb_{\rm J}Sn.

In spite of the close similarity among V_{\rm J}Ga, V_{\rm J}Ge, and V_{\rm J}Si, there exists a large variation in the amounts of hydrogen that can dissolve in these compounds under the same conditions. For instance, the maximum x's obtained in V_{\rm J}GaH_{\rm x} are \sim -38 and \sim 140 times those in V_{\rm J}GeH_{\rm x} and V_{\rm J}SiH_{\rm x}, respectively, under the most favorable conditions of ours. Therefore, the susceptibility S of these compounds to hydrogenation decreases in the order of V_{\rm J}Ga, V_{\rm J}Ge, and V_{\rm J}Si. Earlier, it was noticed[8] that hydrogenation took place much more easily in Nb_{\rm J}Ge than in Nb_{\rm J}Sn. As shown in Table 1 we find that such a trend of S variation is also followed by the rate of percentage increase of a_{0} due to hydrogenation in both the V- and Nb-based systems; i.e., S increases as \Delta a_{0}/a_{0} per at. % of H absorbed increases. In other words, it is easier to dissolve an H atom in an A15 compound when the lattice of this compound opens

  up more readily to accomodate the large H atom. This seems to be consistent with the observation that S is larger for V3M with larger a0 as shown in Table I. Unfortunately, such a _S_-_a_0 correlation is no longer valid for Nb3Ge and Nb3Sn. Since the tetrahedral sites are less closely packed than the octahedral sites in an A15 structure, the former are more likely to be occupied by the dissolved H atoms. It is also clear from Table I that the a0 increase rate induced by a or n irradiation also varies in the same fashion as that induced by hydrogenation. In view of the metallurgical difficulties involved in preparing a stoichiometry and defect free V3Ga or Nb3Ge, the large susceptibility of hydrogenation or irradiation induced defect formation may be associated with the high metastability of the compounds. Whether the large S is caused by the enhanced trapping8 of H or by the inherent defects of a metastable compound is yet to be proved. In this respect, it should be noted that the rate of _n_-induced _T_c degradation was previously observed to increase continuously in V3Ga_{x}(Ref. [13]) for x varying from <1 to >1, but to pass a maximum1 in Nb3Al_{x} and Nb3Pt_{x} at x = 1. No correlation of S with _T_c or a0 of the unhydrogenated A15 compounds was found. The extreme difficulty to obtain x between 0.4 and 1.4 in V3GaH_{x} (see Fig. 2) leads us to the suggestion of the possible existence of a hydride phase.

As shown in Table I the rate of _T_c suppression by hydrogen at the low-concentration region is about the same for the hydrogenated V3Ga, V3Ge, Nb3Ge, and Nb3Sn ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 K/[H] (at.%). However, no _T_c shift larger than +-0.005 K was detected in V3SiH_{x}. While it is true that the maximum x in V3SiH_{x} is only 0.014 (corresponding to 0.35 at.%), a _T_c reduction of 0.14 K would have been expected, even based on a rate of 0.4 K/[H] (at.%). Our observation is consistent with the earlier suggestion7 that the _T_c of a relatively stable and defect free V3Si is rather insensitive to the initial drop in the density of states at the Fermi energy due to the shortening of the electron lifetime resulting from the electron-imperfection scattering. A specific-heat experiment to determine if the electron density of states of V3SiH_{0.014} is indeed drastically suppressed with its _T_c unaffected is currently planned.

Studies on defected A15 high-_T_c compounds except Mo3Ge (Ref. [14]), which has a very low density of states, have revealed two simple universal _T_c-_a_0(Ref. [15]) and _T_c-RR3[resistivity ratio (RR)] correlations; i.e., _T_c increases with a0 decrease and RR increase, independent of the origin of defects which causes the changes in a0 and RR. According to these correlations, pressure should always enhance _T_c and the rate of _T_c enhancement should be larger for samples with lower _T_c. However, study16 on the sputtered Nb-Ge thin films with a wide range of _T_c, caused by varying the deposition conditions of the films, yields results in complete defiance of the predictions; i.e., pressure always suppresses _T_c at a decreasing rate with _T_c decrease. Although we have observed in the present investigation that pressure always enhances _T_c of V3GaH_{x}, the rate of _T_c enhancement remains unexpectedly constant, independent of x (see Fig. 4). This confirms the suggestion16 that defects do not affect _T_c through the accompanying volume expansion. It also demonstrates that, in spite of the insensitivity of the _T_c degradation to the origin of imperfections, differentiation does exist between imperfections introduced by hydrogenation and variation in sample preparation conditions. In fact, insofar as the annealing recovery of _T_c is concerned, the _T_c degradation of the hydrogenated and irradiated compounds is reversible, whereas that of the compounds prepared under conditions other than optimum are not. For instance, one has not been able to raise the low _T_c of a defected Nb3Ge sample prepared under nonoptimal conditions. To understand such difference is one of the most challenging problems in the study of high-_T_c compounds. Further study on defected samples due to hydrogenation and irradiation will be very helpful. Preliminary investigation17 on the near edge _x_-ray absorption of V3GaH_{x} seems to indicate that, within the experimental resolution of a few eV, large electronic structure changes occur only in V sites but not in Ga sites.

## V Conclusion

We have studied the hydrogenation in V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si. The susceptibility S to hydrogenation was found to decrease rapidly in the order of V3Ga, V3Ge, and V3Si. At the same time, S increases with increasing rate of the a0 expansion due to hydrogenation. The same is true for the hydrogenated Nb3Ge and Nb3Sn. The large S may be related to the high metastability of the compounds. The irradiation induced a0-expansion rate varies with compounds in the same fashion as the hydrogenation induced rate of a0 expansion. The results of this study also suggest the possible existence of a hydride phase of V3GaH_{x} for x  1.4.

Although hydrogen was found to rapidly suppress the _T_c of V3Ga and V3Ge, no effect was detected in V3Si. This is consistent with the suggestion that _T_c of a nearly perfect V3Si depends less sensitively on the electron density of states at the Fermi energy. Specific-heat measurements on V3SiH_{x} are planned.

The pressure was found to enhance the _T_c of V3GaH_{x} at a constant rate, independent of x although the accompanying _T_c ranges from 8.1 to 15.3 K. The reason is still unknown. However, comparison of the present results with those on the Nb-Ge sputtered thin films suggests that defects due to hydrogenation and irradiation may play a different role in high  temperature superconductivity from those due to the variation in sample preparation conditions. A near edge x-ray-absorption investigation to assess the role of hydrogen in V_{3}Ga is currently under way. Preliminary results indicate that changes occur only at the V sites.
