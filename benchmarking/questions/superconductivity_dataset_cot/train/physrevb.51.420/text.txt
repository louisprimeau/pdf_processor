###### Abstract

A superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) of 8.0 K is reported for the nonmagnetic (Th\({}^{++}\)) ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound with the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type structure and a derived coherence length \(\xi\)(0) of 230 A and a penetration depth \(\lambda\)(0) of 860 A. No transition down to 2 K was observed for the magnetic, mixed-valence (U\({}^{++}\)/U\({}^{0+}\) or average valence of +5.2) UNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound with the same structure. Systematic variation of \(T_{c}\) for the quaternary and pseudoquaternary compounds in the _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system (_R_ = Sc, Y, La, Lu, Th, U, or magnetic lanthanides) is studied through the variation of \(T_{c}\) with the \(R\) ionic radius, Ni-Ni nearest-neighbor in-plane distance, and the normal-state Pauli-like temperature-independent paramagnetic susceptibility. Maximum \(T_{c}\) at 16.6 K for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with an optimum Ni-Ni distance of 2.45 A was observed, along with a large normal-state Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility. As a comparison, the 8.0-K ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C superconductor has a longer Ni-Ni distance of 2.60 A and a smaller normal-state susceptibility. Variations of the Ni(3_d_)-dominated conduction band and the density of states at the Fermi level _N_(\(E_{F}\)) are believed to be the driving force for the \(T_{c}\) variation of nonmagnetic compounds in the present system.

## I Introduction

Superconducting intermetallic compounds with relatively high transition temperatures \(T_{c}\) up to 23 K have been reported in the _R_T\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds (_R_ = Sc, Y, La or a lanthanide, and \(T\) = Ni, Pd, or Pt).[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] The superconducting phase has been identified as a quaternary LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type body-centered-tetragonal structure with space group \(I\)4/_mmm_. The structure is a three dimensionally connected framework with LuC layers alternated with Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) layers, where nickel is tetrahedrally coordinated by four boron atoms.[4] In the Ni system, the phase formations were reported in _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds (_R_ = Sc, Y, La, Ce, Sm, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm or Lu) with a maximum \(T_{c}\) of 16.6 K for the nonmagnetic LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, followed by 15-16 K for the nonmagnetic YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and ScNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.[1, 3, 4, 5] For magnetic rare-earth compounds, lower superconducting transition temperatures were observed for \(R\) = Ho, Er, and Tm, due to the magnetic pair-breaking effect.[3] No superconducting transition down to 5 K was observed for the nonmagnetic LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.[3] The electronic band properties have been calculated on LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C which features a density of states at the Fermi level _N_(\(E_{F}\)) peak near the top of the nearly filled Ni(3_d_) bands, with only modest admixture from B and C. All characteristics are indicative of a good, three-dimensional metal.[7, 8] A strong-coupled phonon mechanism is deduced with a very large electron-phonon coupling parameter \(\lambda\), which is related to an unusual combination of states at the Fermi level and a substantial contribution from the vibration of the light atoms.[8]

In addition to the important question concerning the mechanism and symmetry of superconductivity, two fundamental questions remain to be answered: (1) Are there any more isostructural superconductors? (2) What is the systematic of superconductivity for these superconductors?

From the simple \(R\) ionic size consideration and previous experiences on ternary boride superconductors,[9, 10] we expect the phase formation of actinide compounds _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (Th or U). In addition, we expect the occurrence of superconductivity if these compounds are nonmagnetic (Th\({}^{4+}\) or U\({}^{6+}\)).

## II Experiments

All quaternary and pseudoquaternary _R_Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (_R_ = Sc, Y, La, Th, U or a lanthanide) samples were prepared by arc melting the high-purity elements (_R_ : 99.9%, Ni:99.999%, B:99.9995%, and C:99.999%) under an argon atmosphere in a Zr-gettered arc furnace. Crystallographic data were obtained with a Rigaku Rotatfex rotating anode powder x-ray diffractometer using Cu \(K_{a}\) radiation with a scanning rate of 1deg in 2_th_ per minute. A LAZY pulverIX-PC program was employed for phase identification and lattice parameter calculations. Electrical resistivity measurements (16 Hz) were carried out by the standard four-probe method in a RMC Cryosystems closed-cycle refrigerator down to 9 K and using single shot cooling to 7 K. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements were made with a Quantum Design MPMS superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer down to 2 K in an applied field from 20 G to 5 T.

## III Results and Discussion

The powder x-ray-diffraction patterns of ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C sample can be well indexed as the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type structure with tetragonal lattice parameters \(a\) = 3.683(3) A, \(c\) = 10.22(1) A, and unit-cell volume \(V\) = 138.6(1) A [3].

 The powder x-ray-diffraction data for the UNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C sample show multiphase patterns. However, a pattern search indicates that the majority phase is the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C-type phase with tetragonal lattice parameters \(a\!=\!3.486(3)\) A, \(c\!=\!10.70(1)\) A, and unit-cell volume \(V\!=\!130.0(1)\) A [3]. By comparing the lattice parameters and \(R\) ionic radii of the present results with reported data for other nonmagnetic \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(R^{3+}\!=\!\)Sc, Y, La, and Lu) compounds,[4, 5] a nonmagnetic Th\({}^{4+}\) character can be deduced for the ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound and a magnetic, mixed-valence U\({}^{4+}\)/U\({}^{6+}\) character with an average valence of \(+\,5.2\) can be deduced for the UNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound.

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity \(\rho(T)\) for ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is shown collectively in Fig. 1. Both samples exhibit good metallic behavior. Zero resistivity \(T_{c}\) (zero) was at 8.0 K for ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, with a superconducting midpoint transition \(T_{c}\) (mid) at 8.4 K and onset (1% resistivity drop) \(T_{c}\) (onset) at 8.9 K.[11] The room-temperature resistivity is 139.6 \(\mu\Omega\) cm, with a resistivity ratio \(\rho(RT)/\rho(10\)K) of 4.6. No superconducting transition down to 7 K was observed for the mixed-valence UNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound as expected from the magnetic pair-breaking effect. The room-temperature resistivity is 111.3 \(\mu\Omega\) cm and the resistivity ratio \(\rho(RT)/\rho(10\) K\()\!=\!7.5\).

The low-temperature mass magnetic susceptibilities \(\chi_{g}(T)\) of the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and Th-based pseudoquaternary (La\({}_{0.5}\)Th\({}_{0.5}\))Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds are shown in Fig. 2 in a low applied field of 50 G. A diamagnetic superconducting signal was observed at 8.0 K for ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, which is consistent with the resistivity measurement.[11] A large ZFC shielding signal of \(-\,8.92\times 10^{-3}\) emu/(g G) at 2 K for the bulk polycrystalline sample indicates the bulk superconductivity effect (using the calculated x-ray density of 5.53 g/cm\({}^{3}\)). Since the ionic radius of 1.02 A for the nonmagnetic Th\({}^{4+}\) ion is among 1.061 A for the La\({}^{3+}\) ion of the nonsuperconducting LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound and 0.893 A for the Y\({}^{3+}\) ion of the 15.6-K superconductor YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C,[9] the ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound is indeed expected to be superconducting around 8 K. Above \(T_{c}\), normal-state susceptibility is Pauli-like temperature independent with a paramagnetic molar susceptibility value of 1.9\(\times 10^{-4}\) emu/(mol G). For the pseudoquaternary bulk sample (La\({}_{0.5}\)Th\({}_{0.5}\))Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C [\(a\!=\!3.746(3)\) A, \(c\!=\!9.929(1)\) A] with a larger average ionic radius of 1.041 A for (La\({}^{3+}\)Th\({}^{4+}\)), \(T_{c}\) decreases to 3.9 K with a ZFC shielding signal of \(-\,9.90\times 10^{-5}\) emu/(g G) at 2 K. No superconducting transition down to 2 K was observed for the light rare-earth compounds LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, CeNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and compounds PrNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and NdNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.[12]

The initial magnetization curves \(M(H)\) at 2, 5 and 7 K for ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C are shown in Fig. 3. Lower critical field \(H_{c1}(T)\) is determined from the deviation of linearity in the low-field region with \(H_{c1}(7\) K) of 50 G, \(H_{c1}\) (5 K) of 210 G, and \(H_{21}(2\) K) of 750 G. The extrapolated \(H_{c1}(0)\) is 900 G. Upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\) is determined from the deviations of linearity from the high-field paramagnetic region with \(H_{c2}(7\) K) of 1.5 kG, \(H_{c2}(5\) K) of 4 kG, and \(H_{c2}(2\) K) of 8 kG. The extrapolated \(H_{c2}(0)\) is 1 T. The derived coherence length \(\xi(0)\) of 230 A and the penetration depth \(\lambda(0)\) of 860 A indicate that this lower \(T_{c}\) compound is a type-II superconductor with the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa\) value of 3.7.

The temperature dependence of mass magnetic susceptibility \(\chi_{g}(T)\) for UNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C shows no diamagnetic superconducting signals down to 2 K. Instead, an antiferromagnetic/weak ferromagnetic transition was ob

  served around 17 K. The magnetic data is consistent with the magnetic, mixed-valence U\({}^{6+}\)/U\({}^{6+}\) picture (with an average valence of \(+\,5.2\)). However, the 17-K transition may not arise from the tetragonal (1221) phase due to the multiphase nature of the sample. Careful sample improvement and magnetic studies are in progress.

To investigate the systematic of superconductivity in the borocarbide system, superconductivity of Lu-based compounds is also studied. The low-temperature mass magnetic susceptibility \(\chi_{g}(T)\) of the nonmagnetic LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and Lu-based pseudoquaternary (\(R\)\({}_{0.5}\)Lu\({}_{0.5}\))Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(R\) = Sc or La) compounds are shown in Fig. 4 for comparison. The superconducting transition at 16.6 K was obtained for the parent compound. Above \(T_{c}\), normal-state susceptibility is also Pauli-like with a paramagnetic molar susceptibility value of 3.9\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) emu/(mol G). For the pseudoquaternary compound (Sc\({}_{0.5}\)Lu\({}_{0.5}\))Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C [ \(a\) = 3.441(3) A, \(c\) = 10.66(1) A], \(T_{c}\) of 15.6 K was observed with a ZFC shielding signal of \(\sim\) 8.41\(\times\)10\({}^{-3}\) emu/(g G) at 5 K for the bulk sample. For the (La\({}_{0.5}\)Lu\({}_{0.5}\))\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compound [ \(a\) = 3.577(3) A, \(c\) = 10.44(1) A], a \(T_{c}\) of 14.8 K was observed with a ZFC shielding signal of \(-\,1.01\times 10^{-2}\) emu/(g G) at 5 K.

The variation of superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) with the ionic radius of both nonmagnetic and magnetic \(R\)\({}^{3+}\) ions for the quarternary and pseudo-quaternary compounds in the \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system (\(R\) = Sc, Y, La, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm or Lu) is shown in Fig. 5. For the Th-based compounds, Th\({}^{4+}\) ionic radius was used. For UNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, both U\({}^{4+}\) and U\({}^{6+}\) ionic radii are used for comparison. In the nonmagnetic compounds, \(T_{c}\) increases from 15.6 K from the smaller Sc\({}^{3+}\) ion to a maximum \(T_{c}\) of 16.6 K for Lu\({}^{3+}\), and then decreases monotonically to 15.6 K for Y\({}^{3+}\), 8.0 K for the larger Th\({}^{4+}\), and not superconducting for the largest La\({}^{3+}\) ion. For magnetic compounds (\(R\) = Tm, Er, Ho, Dy, Gd), \(T_{c}\) decreases sharply due to strong magnetic pair-breaking effect. Long-range antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic transitions are expected for these magnetic superconductors. For GdNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, an antiferromagnetic transition at 19 K was observed.[12] The absence of superconductivity in UNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C may be originated from the same reason, where the magnetic, mixed-valence U\({}^{4+}\)/U\({}^{6+}\) provides strong magnetic pair-breaking effect.

There is no obvious correlation between \(T_{c}\) and \(R\) ionic mass. This can be understood since the conduction band mainly arises from the Ni(3_d_) electrons. The \(R\) atoms then influence \(T_{c}\) indirectly by their effect on the phonon structure, and by charge transfer to the conduction bands. The insertion of different \(R\) ions will change the in-plane and \(c\)-axis Ni-Ni distances and thus changes the electronic structure and bandwidths of the Ni(3_d_)-dominated conduction bands.

  tance of 2.362 A and a normal-state paramagnetic molar susceptibility value of 2.4 x 10-4 emu/(mol G).5 The ThNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C superconductor with a \(T_{c}\) of 8 K has a longer Ni-Ni distance of 2.604 A and a smaller normal-state paramagnetic molar susceptibility value of 1.9 x 10-4 emu/(mol G). A very long Ni-Ni distance of 2.683 A was observed for nonsuperconducting LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. The variation of the Ni-Ni distance results in a variation of the electronic band structure and the Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility is a measure of the density of states at the Fermi level \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\). This trend indicates the importance of the variation of the Ni(3_d_)-dominated conduction-band structure and \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) for the systematic \(T_{c}\) variation of these nonmagnetic compounds. The derived \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) for the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C sample from normal-state magnetic susceptibility is 5.9 states/eV cell, a value very close to the calculated 4.8 states/eV cell from band-structure calculations.7,8

Since this relatively high-\(T_{c}\) system is a three-dimensional good metal, the correlation with superconductivity is evident if the phonon-mediated McMillan \(T_{c}\) formula for strong coupling is valid, then the electron-phonon coupling parameter \(\lambda\) of the exponential factor of the \(T_{c}\) equation will be related to the density of states at the Fermi level \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) as \(\lambda\) can be written as \(\lambda = N\left(E_{F}\right)\left\{I^{2}\right\}/M\left(\Omega^{2}\right)\), where \(\left\langle I^{2}\right\rangle\) is the average of the square of the electron-phonon matrix elements, \(M\) is the mass, and \(\left\langle\Omega^{2}\right\rangle\) is the average of the square of the phonon frequencies.13 A very large coupling parameter \(\lambda\) of 2.6 was reported for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C from band-structure calculations and resistivity data, which is related to an unusual combination of states at the Fermi level and a substantial contribution from the vibration of the light atoms.8

## IV Conclusion

Systematic variations of \(T_{c}\) for the quaternary and pseudoquaternary compounds in the \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C system (\(R\) =Sc, Y, La, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Lu, Th or U) are studied through the variation of \(R\) ionic radius, the Ni-Ni nearest-neighbor in-plane distance and the normal-state Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility. Variation of density of states at the Fermi level \(N\left(E_{F}\right)\) seems to be the dominating factor for the \(T_{c}\) variation of nonmagnetic compounds in the present system.
