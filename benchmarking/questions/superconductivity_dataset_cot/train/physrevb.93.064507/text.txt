###### Abstract

Superconductivity is observed with critical temperatures near 9 K in the tetragonal compound Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\). This material adopts the Cr\({}_{5}\)B\({}_{3}\) structure pre common to superconducting Nb\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{3-x}\)B\({}_{x}\), Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), and W\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), which have critical temperatures of 5.8-7.8 K. We have synthesized polycrystalline samples of the compound, made measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity, and performed first-principles electronic structure calculations. The highest \(T_{c}\) value (9.2 K) occurs in slightly phosphorus rich samples, with composition near Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1,1}\),B\({}_{1.9}\), and the upper critical field H\({}_{c2}\) at \(T=0\) is estimated to be \(\approx\)17 kOe. Together, the measurements and band-structure calculations indicate intermediate coupling (\(\lambda=1.0\)), phonon mediated superconductivity. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity and upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) below \(T_{c}\) suggest multiple superconducting gaps may be present.

## I Introduction

The tetragonal Cr\({}_{5}\)B\({}_{3}\) structure type is adopted by a wide variety of binary and ternary compounds with examples incorporating at least 47 different elements spanning the main group, transitions metals, and rare-earth metals [1]. One of the more interesting subsets of these compounds is the ternary borides with stoichiometries \(M_{5}\)XB\({}_{2}\), with \(X\) = P,Si. These are reported to form with many transition metals (\(M\)) including the 3\(d\) transition metals from V to Co, the 4\(d\) transition metals Nb and Mo, and the 5\(d\) transition metal W. Mn\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) and Mn\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) are ferromagnets with Curie temperatures near room temperature and are of interest for magnetocaloric applications [2,3]. Fe\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) and Fe\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) are uniaxial ferromagnets with high Curie temperatures, and a low temperature spin reorientation in the case of the silicide, and have been studied as potential permanent magnet materials [4, 5, 6, 7]. In striking contrast to these high-temperature ferromagnets, the 4\(d\) and 5\(d\) compounds Nb\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), and W\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) are superconductors with transition temperatures of 7.2, 5.8, and 5.8 K, respectively [8, 9, 10]. The occurrence of superconductivity in these borosilicate compounds brings to mind other well-known boron-containing, phonon-mediated superconductors, including the borocarbides \(RT_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(R\) = rare-earth element, \(T\) = Ni, Pd, Pt) [11] and magnesium diboride MgB\({}_{2}\)[12].

The observation of superconductivity in several examples of Cr\({}_{5}\)B\({}_{3}\)-type compounds with the 512 stoichiometry suggests that further examination may produce more examples in this relatively new group of superconductors [9]. In the present work, we have studied the analogous Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\), and find that it too is a superconductor. The superconducting critical temperature (\(T_{c}\)) is determined to be as high as 9.2 K. This is the highest \(T_{c}\) yet reported for superconductors in this structure type. In addition to measurements of resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity, we report results of first-principles calculations that reveal the presence of multiple bands crossing the Fermi level in this borophosphate and the related borosilicides, as seen in, for example, the iron-based superconductors including the phosphide LaFePO [13], as well as MgB\({}_{2}\)[14]. Calculations indicate the coupling in Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) is in the intermediate limit (i.e., the electron-phonon coupling \(\lambda\approx 1\)). Analysis of the heat-capacity and upper critical field data suggests the presence of two distinct energy gaps. Together the experimental and theoretical results indicate that Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) may be a multiband superconductor.

## II Procedures

Polycrystalline samples with nominal compositions Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{0.9}\)B\({}_{2.1}\), Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\), and Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) were prepared from hydrogen-reduced molybdenum powder (99.999%), phosphorus pieces (99.999%), and boron powder (99.5%). The elements were reacted together at 1050 degC for 16-24 h, and the resulting powders were pressed into cylindrical pellets and heated at 1100-1150 degC for a total duration of up to eight days, with intermediate grinding and repelletizing. Crystals of the isostructural Fe\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) have been grown from an Fe-P melt [7], however, there is no liquid region on the Mo-rich side of the Mo-P phase diagram below about 1700 degC. The optical floating-zone method has been used to grow crystals of Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\)[15], however, arc-melting experiments in our lab indicate that Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) does not melt congruently, and the volatility of phosphorus may preclude this type of crystal growth. The most likely route to single crystal Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) may be the molten metal flux technique [16, 17], if a suitable flux can be identified.

Powder x-ray diffraction was performed using monochromatic Cu \(K_{a1}\) radiation with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer and analyzed using the Rietveld technique with the fullprof software package [18]. Magnetization measurements were performed with a Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) and physical property measurement system (PPMS). The PPMS was also used for measurements of electrical resistivity and heat capacity. The heat-capacity data were analyzed using both the conventional relaxation method employing small heat pulses (temperature rise of 2% of the sample temperature) and slope-analysis [19] of large heat pulse data (temperature rise of 30% of the sample temperature).

First-principles density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure of Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) were performed using the linearized augmented plane-wave (LAPW) code WIEN2K [20], employing the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof [21]. LAPW sphere radii of 2.41, 2.08, and 1.7 bohrs, respectively for Mo, P, and B were chosen with an \(RK_{\rm max}\) of 7.0, where \(RK_{\rm max}\) is the product of the smallest sphere radius and the largest plane-wave expansion wave vector. Internal coordinates were relaxed until forces on the ions were less than 2 mRy/bohr.

## III Results and Discussion

Rietveld analysis showed the resulting purity of the samples to be 92, 89, and 92% by weight for samples with nominal compositions Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{0.9}\)B\({}_{2.1}\), Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\), and Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\), respectively. Mo\({}_{3}\)P and MoB were observed as impurity phases in all samples. Refinement results are shown for Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) in Fig. 1(a), where the crystal structure is shown in the inset.

Table 1 contains the refined crystallographic properties of the Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) phase in each sample. Allowing mixed occupation of P and B on their respective sites suggested some P may reside on the B site, but did not indicate any mixing of B onto the P site. The compositions determined from the refined occupancies are listed in the table. Adding excess P (relative to Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\)) appears to significantly increase the P content of the main phase, as indicated by both the refined composition as well as the increase in the unit-cell volume. Addition of excess B had no detectable effect on the atomic site occupancies (relative to Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\)) and produced only a small decrease in the unit-cell volume. These observations indicate that there is some phase width in Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) with respect to the P and B ratio, a common feature in this structure type [7, 8, 22, 23, 24], and that in this case excess P is favored.

Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show the ac magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measured below 10 K. All of the samples are superconducting. Values of \(T_{c}\) are determined by the onset of diamagnetism [Fig. 1(b)] and the temperature at which the resistivity reaches zero [Fig. 1(c)]. These are listed for each sample in Table 1. Similar values of \(T_{c}\) = 8.7-8.9 K are seen in the Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{0.9}\)B\({}_{2.1}\) and Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) samples, which have similar stoichiometries as discussed above. A higher value of \(T_{c}\) = 9.2 K is seen in Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\). This demonstrates the sensitivity of the superconductivity to the chemical composition of the Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) phase. Further experimental analysis presented here will focus primarily on the Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) sample. The \(T_{c}\) values seen in these materials are the highest yet reported in this class of ternary superconductors, which include Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 5.8 K) [9], Nb\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 7.2 K) [9], W\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 5.8 K) [10], W\({}_{5-x}\)Ta\({}_{x}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 6.5 K) [25], and the closely related Nb\({}_{5}\)Si\({}_{2.4}\)B\({}_{0.6}\) (\(T_{c}\) = 7.8 K) [22].

Figure 2 shows the results of magnetization measurements on Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\). The dc measurements were conducted in 10 Oe field, and the ac magnetization measurements were conducted in a dc field of 10 Oe using a frequency of 1 kHz and an ac excitation field of 5 Oe. The superconducting transition is marked by the onset of diamagnetism in the dc susceptibility (\(\chi_{dc}\)) and the real part of the ac susceptibility (\(\chi^{\prime}\)), while the imaginary part (\(\chi^{\prime\prime}\)) peaks just below \(T_{c}\). The large diamagnetic signal in both field-cooled (fc) and zero-field-cooled (zfc) measurements demonstrates the bulk nature of the superconductivity. Complete magnetic-flux exclusion corresponds to a volume susceptibility of \(-1/4\pi\) in the units used here. This corresponds to a mass susceptibility of 0.0089 cm\({}^{3}\)/g using the single-crystal density of 8.97 g/cm\({}^{3}\) determined from the structure refinements presented above. Thus, the shielding fraction indicated by the data in Fig. 2(a) exceeds unity by almost a factor of 2. This may be attributed to geometrical and demagnetization effects in these samples, which were loosely compacted powders in irregular shapes. A shielding volume fraction of 120% was observed (with no demagnetization correction) for a denser sample that was cold pressed at high pressure between tungsten carbide anvils.

Resistivity data for polycrystalline Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) are shown in Fig. 3. The residual resistivity ratio is \(\rho_{2K}^{2T}/\rho_{300K}\) = 11, relatively high considering the polycrystalline nature of the sample. The resistivity varies like \(T^{2.4}\) above \(T_{c}\) up to about 60 K. Above about 100 K, \(\rho(T)\) displays a negative curvature rather than the linear behavior expected for most metals.

Figure 1: The crystal structure of Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) is shown in (a) along with results of Rietveld refinement of powder x-ray-diffraction data from a sample with nominal composition Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\). The ticks locate Bragg reflections from the main phase (92% by weight) and the Mo\({}_{3}\)P and MoB impurity phases. Variation of \(T_{c}\) with nominal composition is demonstrated in (b) and (c), which show magnetic susceptibility and resistivity data, respectively.

  The normal-state temperature dependence is similar to that reported for Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\)[9] and W\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\)[10], and the negative curvature at higher temperatures has been observed as a common feature in a variety of chemically related compounds, based on Mo\({}_{5}\)\(X_{3}\) (\(x=\) Si, B, C) [26]. This behavior is also seen in the \(A15\)-type superconductors, where Fisk and Webb concluded that resistivity saturation results from the approach to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit [27]. This occurs when the electron mean free path reaches a minimum value defined by the lattice constant [28, 29]. Gurvitch [30] cast the resulting relationship between the saturation resistivity \(\rho_{\rm sat}\) in \(\mu\)\(\Omega\) cm, the carrier concentration \(n\) in cm\({}^{-3}\), and lattice parameter \(a\) in A (assuming cubic symmetry) into the following useful form: \(\rho_{\rm sat}=1.29\times 10^{18}/(n^{2/3}a)\)\(\mu\)\(\Omega\) cm. Hall effect measurements on Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) give a Hall coefficient of \(R_{H}\approx-3.1\times 10^{-4}\) cm\({}^{3}\)/C. From this, in a simple one-band model, a carrier concentration of 2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{22}\) electrons per cm\({}^{3}\) is inferred. Using this value of \(n\) and the average lattice constant of (2\(a\)\(+\)\(c\))/3 = 7.7 A gives \(\rho_{\rm sat}=230\)\(\mu\)\(\Omega\) cm. The resistivity data in Fig. 3 exceed this value by about 60% at room temperature, which may be attributed to the polycrystalline nature of the sample with resistive grain boundaries. However, this estimated \(\rho_{\rm sat}\) does compare well with data reported for several isostructural \(M_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) compounds that have been measured up to 1000 K [26].

Resistivity data collected in applied magnetic fields are shown in the upper inset of Fig. 3. In zero field the resistive transition is very sharp, with a width of \(\lesssim\) 0.1 K. The transition broadens as magnetic field is applied, with the width increasing to 0.7 K at 12.5 kOe. This is typical behavior of a type-II superconductor. From the resistivity data, the field dependence of \(T_{c}\) is obtained, where \(T_{c}\) is defined as the temperature

Figure 3: Resistivity of Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) in zero applied magnetic field is shown in the main panel. The upper inset shows the effect of magnetic field on \(T_{c}\), which is plotted in the lower inset. The lower inset also includes data from the Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) sample for comparison.

Figure 2: Results from (a) dc and (b) ac magnetization measurements on Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\). The dc data show both zero-field-cooled (zfc) and field-cooled (fc) results. The ac data were collected in zfc mode and both the real (\(\chi^{\circ}\)) and imaginary (\(\chi^{\circ}\)) parts of the ac susceptibility are shown. The superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) determined by the onset of diamagnetism is indicated by the dashed line.

  at which \(\rho\to 0\). The results are shown in the lower inset of Fig. 3, which also include results from the same analysis applied to the sample of nominal composition Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\). From these data, an upper critical field \(H_{c2}(0)\) of \(\approx\)17 kOe can be estimated. This is significantly larger than in the closely related superconductors Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) and W\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), for which values of 6 and 5 kOe, respectively, are reported [9,10]. Nearly linear behavior, with a slight positive curvature near \(H=0\), is observed up to fields of 12.5 kOe in Fig. 3. Fitting this range gives a slope of \(-2.1\) kOe/T. From this value, the WHH expression \(H_{c2}(0)=-0.693T_{c}(d\,H_{c2}/dT)|_{T=T_{c}}\) gives \(H_{c2}(0)=13\) kOe. This is not compatible with the resistivity data collected at \(H=15\) kOe (Fig. 3), for which \(T_{c}\approx 1.5\) K can be estimated (Fig. 3). This discrepancy is a direct result of the nearly linear relationship between magnetic field and \(T_{c}\) over a wide range of fields. A similar shape of \(H_{c2}\) vs \(T_{c}\) is seen in W\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\)[10], but reports for Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) show clear negative curvature over most of the temperature range [9], more consistent with expectations based on the WHH theory. The observed temperature dependence of the upper critical field \(H_{c2}\) in polycrystalline Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) may be an indication of contributions from multiple superconducting gaps arising from underlying crystalline anisotropy or from multiple superconducting bands. Similar shapes have been observed in several multigap superconductors including polycrystalline MgB\({}_{2}\)[31] and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.89}\)P\({}_{0.11}\)[32], and single crystals of borocarbides [33], dichalcogenides [34,35], and more recently TlNi\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{2}\)[36].

Results of heat-capacity measurements on Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) are shown in Fig. 4. Rietveld refinement of the powder x-ray-diffraction data shows that this sample contains 7 wt % of Mo\({}_{3}\)P, which is a superconductor with \(T_{c}\) reported of 5-7 K [37, 38, 39]. For this study, an Mo\({}_{3}\)P sample was synthesized and its heat capacity was measured and subtracted from the total heat capacity measured for the Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) sample after scaling by the x-ray-diffraction determined concentration. The measured \(T_{c}\) for the Mo\({}_{3}\)P sample was 5.5 K. See the Appendix for additional data and information.

At 300 K the heat capacity of Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1.1}\)B\({}_{1.9}\) reaches 86% of the Dulong-Petit limit [Fig. 4(a), inset]. The increase in heat capacity upon cooling into the superconducting state is centered at \(T_{c}=9.2\) K. The magnitude of the heat-capacity jump is determined to be 43.2 mJ/mol at./K. Data collected at 30 kOe show that this field is sufficient to suppress the superconductivity to below 2 K, consistent with the resistivity results above that show \(H_{c2}(0)\approx 17\) kOe. Figure 4(b) shows the electronic portion of the heat capacity, determined by subtracting the data collected at 30 kOe. The 30 kOe data are well described up to 9 K by \(c_{P}(T)=\gamma\,T+\beta T^{3}\), as shown by the black line through the data in Fig. 4(a). This fit gives a normal-state Sommerfield coefficient of \(\gamma=3.16(1)\) mJ/mol at./K\({}^{2}\) and a Debye temperature of 492(2) K. Similar values were obtained from the same analysis of heat-capacity data (not shown) for the Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) sample. These values are compared with other isostructural superconductors in Table 2.

Results of electronic band-structure calculations are shown in Fig. 5(a). Six bands are observed to cross the Fermi level, with several bands contributing strongly to the the total density of states (DOS). The partial Fermi-level DOS in these bands (per unit cell per eV, both spins) is found to be 2.06, 4.66, 1.90, 1.10, 0.96, and 0.04, for a total Fermi level DOS \(N(E_{F})\) of 10.7 /eV/unit cell. With 10 Mo per unit cell and the majority of the DOS being Mo [Fig. 5(b)], \(N(E_{F})\) is somewhat enhanced relative to elemental Mo itself, which has \(N(E_{F})\) of 0.65 eV [40], but not to a degree that would suggest a magnetic instability. This argues in favor of a phononic pairing mechanism.

The value of \(\gamma\) determined from the calculated band structure [Fig. 5(a)] is 1.57 mJ/mol at./K\({}^{2}\). This is significantly lower than the observed value of 3.16 mJ/mol at./K\({}^{2}\). This

The total heat capacity \(c_{P}\) is shown in (a), near \(T_{c}\) in the main panel and up to 300 K in the inset. The electronic component of the heat capacity determined by subtracting data collected at \(H=30\) kOe from data taken in zero field is shown in (b) plotted as \(c_{c}/T\). The solid line in (b) is at \(c_{c}/T=\gamma\).

  enhancement by a factor of 2.01(= 1 + \(\lambda\)) gives an electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda\) of approximately 1, indicating intermediate coupling. For a single-band \(s\)-wave scenario, Eliashberg theory [41] gives a reduced specific-heat jump of approximately 2 for elemental Nb, which has a similar \(\lambda\). The observed value of \(\Delta c/\gamma\,T_{c}\) in Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) is 1.49, close to the weak-coupling BCS value, but only 75% of the value expected based on the estimated electron-phonon coupling strength for this compound.

In general, such a reduced specific-heat jump can result from two factors. The first of these is gap anisotropy, including nodal behavior as observed in the superconducting cuprates [42] or more recently in LaFePO, a structural relative of the high \(T_{c}\) iron-based superconductors [43; 44]. For example, the BCS weak-coupling theory, applied to a single band two-dimensional \(d\)-wave material [45], predicts a reduced specific-heat jump \(\Delta c/\gamma\,T_{c}\) of 0.95. However, there is little evidence for nodal superconductivity in Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\). For example, the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state in Fig. 4(b) at 1.9 K, or approximately 20 percent of \(T_{c}\), is only 2% of the normal-state value at \(T_{c}\), consistent with BCS predictions for a gapped \(s\)-wave superconductor.

The second possibility for such a reduced specific-heat jump is multiband superconductivity, as observed in MgB\({}_{2}\)[12]. Strictly speaking this can be considered a form of anisotropy, but here we follow the historical context and treat it separately from the Fermi-surface gap anisotropy described above. In MgB\({}_{2}\), well established to be an intermediate coupling multiband \(s\)-wave superconductor [46], the largest specific-heat jump \(\Delta c/\gamma\,T_{c}\) was observed [47] to be 1.32, less than the BCS \(s\)-wave value. The band-structure calculations for Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) support the possibility of multiband superconductivity, since several bands contribute significant DOS at the Fermi level.

Further evidence suggesting potential multiband behavior is seen in the temperature dependence of the heat capacity measured below \(T_{c}\). In Fig. 6 we depict the heat-capacity data of Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\), along with two calculated curves: a single band BCS fit where the \(T\) = 0 gap value has been taken as the canonical BCS weak-coupling value, 1.76\(k_{B}\,T_{c}\), and a two band fit with two gaps. The smaller gap is weighted at one-third the weight of the larger and the two gap fitting yields one gap of 0.65 times the BCS value and the other gap 1.12 times the BCS value. The relative weighting of the two band fit is in rough agreement with the highest two Fermi-level DOS values from the band-structure calculations.

Experimental data from Nb, which has a similar electron-phonon coupling \(\lambda\) as well as similar \(T_{c}\), is included in Fig. 6 for comparison. The data were taken from Ref. [48]. If Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) is a single band superconductor, as Nb is known to be, one would expect a similar electronic specific-heat curve. Instead, one finds a specific-heat jump \(\Delta c/\gamma\,T_{c}\) only slightly above the weak-coupling BCS value. In addition, the low-temperature

The energy zero is set to the Fermi energies of the respective compounds.

Experimental data for Nb, a single gap superconductor with similar \(T_{c}\), and \(\lambda\) are also shown for comparison (black triangles) [48]. Inset: the low-temperature specific-heat data and fits on a logarithmic scale.

  specific heat is _enhanced_ relative to the BCS value, as indicated in the inset. The low-\(T\) enhancement of the specific heat was found, in the case of MgB\({}_{2}\)[47], to result from having one gap much smaller than the BCS value. Often the specific heat at low temperature is taken to vary exponentially in \(-\Delta/T\), where \(\Delta\) is the smallest energy gap in the system, but the data (red diamonds) in the logarithmic plot in the inset of Fig. 6 show a substantial curvature demonstrating excitations across at least two gaps. The two band fit significantly improves upon the BCS fit, generating better agreement at both low temperatures and temperatures near \(T_{c}\), though measurements on single crystals would be desirable to support this. This is consistent with the electronic structure calculations, finding multiple bands crossing \(E_{F}\).

It is of interest to compare the experimental and theoretical results for Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) to the isostructural compound Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), which is itself a superconductor with a somewhat lower \(T_{c}\) of 5.8 K [9]. From a comparison of our calculated \(\gamma\) of 1.22 mJ/mol atom K\({}^{2}\) for the Si compound with the \(\gamma\) of 2.12 mJ/mol atom K\({}^{2}\) measured in Ref. [9], an electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda_{Mo_{5}SiB_{2}}\) of 0.73 is determined, significantly lower than the value of 1.0 we infer for the P compound. Given that the Debye temperatures of these two materials are quite similar, the lower value of \(\lambda\) for the Si compound immediately translates to a lower \(T_{c}\).

Our calculations also provide insight into the source of this change in \(\lambda\). Presented in the inset of Fig. 5(b) are the calculated total densities of states of the two compounds in a window of width approximately 4 eV, centered on \(E_{F}\). It is apparent that the densities of states can nearly be superimposed upon each other in a "rigid-band" manner, with a shift of approximately 0.2 eV corresponding directly to the two fewer valence electrons of the Si compound. Since the calculated densities of states both generally increase with energy around the respective Fermi energies, the effective hole doping associated with the substitution of Si for P lowers the Fermi-level DOS. We note that this DOS reduction from 10.7 to 8.30 per eV per unit cel, or 22%, parallels the inferred 27% \(\lambda\) reduction from the P compound to the Si compound. This suggests that the electron phonon matrix element \(V\) [recalling that in BCS theory \(\lambda=N(E_{F})V\)] is similar in the two compounds, as is reasonable. In addition, the calculations are consistent with the observation that the P-rich sample Mo\({}_{5}\)P\({}_{1,1}\),B\({}_{1,9}\) has a higher \(T_{c}\) than the Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) sample (Table 1), since the DOS at \(E_{F}\) [Fig. 5(b)] would be increased by the substitution of P for B.

Our first-principles calculations and analysis of the experimental data thus suggest that Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) is an intermediate coupling, phonon-mediated, and potentially multiband superconductor. We note that it is possible that the superconductors Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) and additionally Nb\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) are also multiband materials as our calculations (depicted in the Appendix) find each of these materials to have several bands crossing E\({}_{F}\).

## IV Summary and Conclusions

We have discovered a new superconductor, Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\), with critical temperature \(T_{c}\) as high as 9.2 K. It crystallizes in a tetragonal Cr\({}_{8}\)B\({}_{3}\) structure shared by a number of superconductors, such as Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), Nb\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), and W\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), and has the highest transition temperature and upper critical field reported for this family of compounds. Electron doping may be expected to increase \(T_{c}\) further. Based on analysis of the specific-heat data as well as our first-principles calculations, Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\) appears to be an intermediate-coupling, multigap, phonon-mediated superconductor.

## Appendix

### Electronic structure of Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) and Nb\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\)

Figure 7 shows results from first-principles calculations for the superconductors Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) and Nb\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\), isostructural

  to Mo\({}_{5}\)PB\({}_{2}\). These calculations were also carried out using the LAPW method, with an \(RK_{\mathrm{max}}\) of 7.0 and all internal coordinates relaxed, and approximately 1000 \(k\) points in the full Brillouin zone used for all calculations; spin-orbit coupling was not included. As is apparent, both these compounds have multiple bands cutting the Fermi level, with six such bands for Mo\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\) and four for Nb\({}_{5}\)SiB\({}_{2}\). This is indicative of a potential multiband superconductivity in these materials, although definitive resolution of this issue would require further investigation.
