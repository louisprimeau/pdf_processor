## II Experimental techniques and theoretical methods

### Crystals preparation

High quality single crystals of CaK(Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Ni\({}_{x}\))\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{4}\) with doping levels of \(x=0\), \(x=0.017\), and \(x=0.034\) were grown by high temperature solution growth out of FeAs flux. The Ni doping level was determined by wavelength-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (for details of the synthesis and complete characterization see Ref. [23]). All the investigated crystals were cleaved and reduced to the form of thin rectangular plates with thicknesses of less than 50 \(\mu\)m, in the direction of the \(c\) axis of the crystals, and width and length one order of magnitude larger.

### Tunnel-diode resonator

A temperature variation of the London penetration depth in-plane component \(\Delta\lambda_{L,ab}\) (T) was measured using a self-oscillating tunnel-diode resonator (TDR) where the sample is subject to a small AC magnetic field parallel to the \(c\) axis of the sample. This field configuration induces in-plane supercurrents \(j_{ab}\) and allows a direct measure of \(\lambda_{L,ab}\). The resonant frequency shift from the value of the empty resonator is recorded and is proportional to the sample magnetic susceptibility, determined by \(\lambda_{L}\) and the sample shape, in the end the variations of the penetration depth with temperature \(\Delta\lambda_{L,ab}(T)=\lambda_{L,ab}(T)-\lambda_{L,ab}(0)\) can be determined (see Fig. 1). A detailed description of this technique can be found elsewhere [12, 14, 24, 25].

### NV centers magnetometry

The determination of the low temperature absolute value of the London penetration depth \(\lambda_{L}(0)\) is carried out by means of the newly developed NV centers magnetometry technique [26]. This consists of the measurement of the field of the first vortex penetration \(H_{p}\) on the sample edge by looking at the the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of Zeeman-split energy levels in the NV centers of a diamond indicator positioned directly on top of the analyzed sample. From \(H_{p}\) it is possible to calculate the value of the lower critical field \(H_{c1}\) considering the effective demagnetization factor \(N\) for a \(2a\times 2b\times 2c\) cuboid in a magnetic field along the \(c\) direction:

\[H_{p}=H_{c1}(1+N_{\chi}),\] (1)

\[N^{-1}=1+\frac{3}{4}\frac{c}{a}\left(1+\frac{a}{b}\right),\] (2)

where \(\chi\) is the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility of the material in the superconducting state, which can be taken to be equal to \(-1\). Finally, from \(H_{c1}\) it is possible to calculate the absolute value of the London penetration depth [27]:

\[H_{c1}=\frac{\phi_{0}}{4\pi\lambda_{L}^{2}}\left(\ln\frac{\lambda_{L}}{\xi}+0. 497\right).\] (3)

The coherence length \(\xi\) can be calculated from the upper critical field and its uncertainty has a small influence on \(\lambda_{L}(0)\) since it appears in the equation only as a logarithm.

### Microwave resonator

The complete characterization of the London penetration depth (absolute value and temperature dependence) can also be carried out by means of a microwave resonator (MWR) technique that has already been applied to other IBS crystals [20-22,28,29]. In this case the measurement system consists of an YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-x}\) coplanar waveguide resonator (with resonance frequency \(f_{0}\) of about 8 GHz) to which the sample is coupled. The whole resonance curve is recorded, making it possible to track not only frequency shifts but also variations of the quality factor, giving access to the absolute value of the penetration depth after a calibration procedure is performed.

It should however be noted that an important difference exists with respect to the TDR technique: in this case the applied AC magnetic field that probes the sample is oriented in-plane instead of along the \(c\) axis. For this reason the measurements yields an effective penetration depth \(\lambda_{L}\) that is a combination of the main components \(\lambda_{L,ab}\) and \(\lambda_{L,c}\) dependent on the geometry of the sample under consideration.

In order to deconvolve the anisotropic contributions from the measured \(\lambda_{L}\), one can study samples with different aspect ratios and analyze how they combine, considering that the penetration of the field occurs starting from all sides of the crystal due to demagnetization effects from the sample that cannot be considered infinite in any direction. The induced supercurrent is therefore in-plane \(j_{ab}\) in a thickness \(\lambda_{L,ab}\) along the \(c\) axis from both top and bottom faces, and out-of-plane \(j_{c}\) in a thickness \(\lambda_{L,c}\) along the \(a\) and \(b\) axes from the two

Figure 1: Temperature dependence of \(\Delta\lambda_{L,ab}\) for all doping levels measured with the TDR technique. The critical temperatures reported in Table 1 correspond to the maximum of the temperature derivative of these curves. The good quality and low disorder level of the samples is testified by the narrow transitions.

  sides. Accordingly, and in the hypothesis that \(\lambda_{L,ab}\ll c\) and \(\lambda_{L,c}\ll a\), \(b\) (where \(c\), \(a\), and \(b\) are, respectively, the thickness, width, and length of the samples), the fraction of penetrated volume can be estimated as \(\lambda_{L,ab}/c+\lambda_{L,c}/a+\lambda_{L,c}/b\)[28]. Thus, the measured penetration depth can be expressed as

\[\lambda_{L}=\lambda_{L,ab}+f_{s}\lambda_{L,c},\] (4)

where \(f_{s}=c(1/a+1/b)\) is the sample shape factor.

Considering two samples with different shape factors \(f_{s}\), it is therefore possible to deconvolve the \(\lambda_{L,ab}\) and \(\lambda_{L,c}\) contributions to the total \(\lambda_{L}\) measured, and to determine the anisotropy parameter \(\gamma_{\lambda}=\lambda_{L,c}/\lambda_{L,ab}\). These quantities are shown in Fig. 2 for the undoped samples. The substantial agreement between the \(\lambda_{L,ab}\) curves validates the approach and the small differences will be discussed in Sec. III.3 in light of the differences between the TDR and MWR techniques. The anisotropy parameter \(\gamma_{\lambda}\), shown in the inset, is found to be comparable to that measured with \(\mu\)SR [30]. Theoretically, substantial variation of the anisotropies of the characteristic lengths with temperature is consistent with multigap superconductivity and, as recently shown, can both increase or decrease with temperature depending on the order parameter symmetry and electronic structure [31].

### Eliashberg modeling

The experimental data can be reproduced within a two-band Eliashberg \(s_{\pm}\)-wave model, allowing a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of the material. The first step consists in calculating self-consistently the gaps and the renormalization functions by solving the two-band Eliashberg equations, then from these quantities the London penetration depth can be calculated. The two-band Eliashberg equations [32, 33, 34] are four coupled equations for the gaps \(\Delta_{i}(i\omega_{n})\) and the renormalization functions \(Z_{i}(i\omega_{n})\), where \(i\) is a band index ranging from 1 to 2 and \(\omega_{n}\) are the Matsubara frequencies. Starting from the general form of the Eliashberg equations, it is possible to reduce the number of input parameters by making some reasonable assumptions for the particular case under consideration. First of all one needs to identify the model for coupling that wants to consider. In the IBS it has been shown that electron-boson coupling is mainly provided by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations [11], therefore we neglect the phononic contribution and we consider the shape of the spectral functions \(\alpha_{ij}^{\rm Z}F^{st}(\Omega)\) discussed in detail in Refs. [20, 28]. However, since the two-band model is an effective one, it is not possible to set to zero the intraband coupling, hence the resulting electron-boson coupling-constant matrix \(\Lambda_{ij}\) reads

\[\Lambda_{ij}=\begin{pmatrix}\Lambda_{11}^{\rm sf}&\Lambda_{12}^{\rm sf}\\ \Lambda_{12}^{\rm sf}v_{12}&\Lambda_{22}^{\rm sf}\end{pmatrix}.\] (5)

The parameter \(v_{12}=N_{1}(0)/N_{2}(0)\) can be extracted from the ARPES measurements in Ref. [3], by assuming that the Fermi momentum in each band is proportional to the normal density of states at the Fermi level in the same band, and adding the contribution of all hole bands for band 1 and all electron bands for band 2. The three constants \(\Lambda_{11}^{\rm sf}\), \(\Lambda_{22}^{\rm sf}\), and \(\Lambda_{12}^{\rm sf}\) will be free parameters (the only ones) of the model.

It is important to note that the choice of coupling mechanism limits the typology of order parameter obtainable; in the specific case of IBS and of AFM spin fluctuations the only order parameter symmetry allowed is \(s_{\pm}\)[11, 35]. This specific state was chosen for the theoretical analysis because most experimental data point towards it [36, 37, 38] and we find it is compatible with our data as well.

Once that the coupling mechanism has been defined, other terms of the general form of the Eliashberg equations can be set to zero: it has been shown that the Coulomb pseudopotential and the gap anisotropy can be neglected for IBS [35, 39, 40]. Moreover, we decide to set to zero also the impurity scattering rate based on two observations: first the fact that the superconducting transition is very narrow for all samples indicates clean systems, second the effects of impurity scattering (increasing interband "mixing" and decreasing \(T_{c}\)) can be effectively considered by changing the coupling constants without adding free parameters in a simple two-band effective model. It should be noted that this approach is only an effective one. The Ni atoms introduced in the structure are scattering centers, but their scattering potential cannot be _a priori_ modeled within a simple scheme as in the case of irradiation induced disorder [21, 22]. For these reasons it is more convenient to practically take into account the effects of Ni doping by modifying the coupling matrix instead.

The imaginary-axis equations [32, 39, 41] under these approximations read

\[\omega_{n}Z_{i}(i\omega_{n})=\omega_{n}+\pi\,T\,\sum_{m,j}\Pi_{ij }^{\rm Z}(i\omega_{n},\,i\omega_{m})N_{j}^{\rm Z}(i\omega_{m}),\] (6) \[Z_{i}(i\omega_{n})\Delta_{i}(i\omega_{n})=\pi\,T\,\sum_{m,j}\left[ \Pi_{ij}^{\rm A}(i\omega_{n},\,i\omega_{m})\right]\] \[\times\,\Theta(\omega_{c}-|\omega_{m}|)N_{j}^{\rm\Delta}(i\omega_ {m}),\] (7)

Figure 2: Deconvolved components \(\lambda_{L,ab}\) (red line) and \(\lambda_{L,c}\) (cyan line) of the MWR measured \(\lambda_{L}(T)\) for undoped CaKFe\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{4}\), \(\lambda_{L,ab}(T)\) from \(\text{TDR}+\text{NV}\) measurements is shown for comparison as black circles. The inset shows the anisotropy factor \(\gamma_{\lambda}\).

  with \(\Pi_{ij}^{Z}(i\omega_{n},i\omega_{m})=\Lambda_{ij}^{st}(i\omega_{n},i\omega_{m})\) and \(\Pi_{ij}^{\Delta}(i\omega_{n},i\omega_{m})=-\Lambda_{ij}^{st}(i\omega_{n},i\omega _{m})\), where

\[\Lambda_{ij}^{st}(i\omega_{n},i\omega_{m})=2\int_{0}^{+\infty}d\Omega\frac{ \Omega\alpha_{ij}^{Z}F^{st}(\Omega)}{[(\omega_{n}-\omega_{m})^{2}+\Omega^{2}]}.\] (8)

\(\Theta\) is the Heaviside function, \(\omega_{c}\) is a cutoff energy, and sf stands for spin fluctuations. Moreover, \(\Pi_{j}^{\Delta}(i\omega_{n})=\Delta_{j}\) (\(i\omega_{m}\))/\(\sqrt{\omega_{m}^{2}\!+\!\Delta_{j}^{2}(i\omega_{m})}\) and \(N_{j}^{Z}(i\omega_{m})\!\!=\!\!\omega_{m}/\sqrt{\omega_{m}^{2}+\Delta_{j}^{2} (i\omega_{m})}\). Finally, the electron-boson coupling constants are defined as \(\Lambda_{ij}^{st}=2\int_{0}^{+\infty}d\Omega\frac{\alpha_{ij}^{Z}F^{st}( \Omega)}{\Omega}\).

The penetration depth can be computed starting from the gaps \(\Delta_{i}(i\omega_{n})\) and the renormalization functions \(Z_{i}(i\omega_{n})\) by

\[\lambda_{L}^{-2}(T) = \left(\frac{\omega_{p}}{c}\right)^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{2}w_{i}^{\lambda }\pi T\] (9) \[\times\sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\Delta_{i}^{2}(\omega_{n})Z _{i}^{2}(\omega_{n})}{[\omega_{n}^{2}Z_{i}^{2}(\omega_{n})+\Delta_{i}^{2}( \omega_{n})Z_{i}^{2}(\omega_{n})]^{3/2}},\]

where \(w_{i}^{\lambda}=(\omega_{p,i}/\omega_{p})^{2  obtained \(n\) values. \(n=1\) implies the gap has \(d\)-wavelike line nodes, exponential low-temperature behavior of \(\lambda(T)\), mimicked by a large exponent \(n>3\)-4, is expected for clean isotropic fully gapped superconductors, and \(n\) approaches 2 in dirty-line-nodal (e.g., \(d\) wave) and dirty-sign-changing s\({}_{\pm}\) superconductors [42]. We find that \(n\) decreases from 2.5 for the undoped sample to 1.9 for the \(x=0.034\) sample, a strong indication that the system is fully gapped and that Ni doping increases the disorder driving the system from the clean to the dirty limit. Moreover, it should be noted that a conventional BCS exponential behavior of \(\Delta\lambda_{L}(T)\) is expected if the exponent \(n\geqslant 3\). This is not the case for this system mainly due to the fact that scattering in \(s_{\pm}\) superconductors is pair breaking and that it presents multigap superconductivity. For these reasons the behavior can look conventional only below a temperature determined by the smallest gap, and much smaller than the usual \(T_{c}/3\) threshold. It follows that the data shown in Fig. 3 cannot be fit well by a simple generalized two \(s\)-wave gap scheme where \(\Delta\lambda_{L}\propto\sum_{i}\lambda_{L}(0)\sqrt{[\pi/2]\Delta_{i}(0)[/(k_ {B}T_{c}t)]}\exp[-|\Delta_{i}(0)|/(k_{B}T_{c}t)]\)[43].

It is in principle possible to identify a QCP in the phase diagram by analyzing the \(\lambda_{L}(0)\) curve as a function of doping level \(x\): it would correspond to a sharp peak in the \(\lambda_{L}(0)(x)\) plot [15, 16]. In the present case such a feature is not visible (as evident from the inset in Fig. 3) due to the fact that a finer spacing in \(x\) would be needed and/or to an effect of disorder that induces an increase of \(\lambda_{L}(0)\) that in turn hides the QCP peak. This does not necessarily exclude the presence of QCP in the analyzed doping range.

### Eliashberg analysis

The Eliashberg equations were solved and the London penetration depth was calculated for all doping values following the approach explained in Sec. II.5, yielding the \(\rho_{s}\) and \(\Delta\lambda_{L}\) vs \(T\) curves presented in Fig. 4 where they are compared to the experimental ones.

The excellent overall agreement, in particular considering that the model employed is an effective two-band one, testifies that the \(s_{\pm}\) symmetry is consistent with the observed data. The parameters used in the calculation are given in Table 1 and Fig. 5 shows the calculated temperature dependence of the gaps for all doping values. The gap values obtained by analytical continuation on the real axis at low temperature (crosses in Fig. 5) for the undoped case are in nice agreement with those measured by the tunneling conductance technique in similar samples [1]. With increasing doping (and therefore decreasing \(T_{c}\)) the gaps become smaller as expected. It is worth noticing that the shape of the small gap changes drastically between the undoped and doped samples, becoming more BCS-like when Ni substitutes Fe. This is due to an increase of the interband coupling (\(\Lambda_{12}\) in Table 1) necessary to reproduce the experimental \(\rho_{s}\). This means that it is the large gap that determines the overall behavior of the system when Ni is introduced: chemical substitution increases scattering that intermixes more of the bands, an effect that can be taken into

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c} Ni doping (\%) & \(T_{c}\) & \(\lambda_{L}(0)\) & \(\Lambda_{11}\) & \(\Lambda_{22}\) & \(\Lambda_{12}\) & \(\Delta_{1}\) & \(\Delta_{2}\) & \(h_{\alpha_{p}}\) \\  & (K) & (nm) & & & & (meV) & (meV) & (meV) \\ \hline

## IV Conclusions

In summary, we employed a combination of three experimental techniques (TDR, NV magnetometry, and MWR) together with theoretical modeling based on the solution of the two-band Eliashberg equations to demonstrate that a complete characterization of the London penetration depth allows to study in depth the fundamental properties of superconducting materials. The comparison between the techniques on undoped CaKFe\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{4}\) shows very good agreement both regarding the \(\lambda_{L}(0)\) absolute values (\(170\pm 20\) nm for MWR and \(196\pm 12\) nm for NV) and the \(\lambda_{L,ab}\) temperature dependence. We ascribe small differences at low temperature to the high frequency probe of the microwave resonator technique that hinders pair-breaking scattering. Overall, the CaK(Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Ni\({}_{x}\))\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{4}\) system (with doping levels between \(x\)=0 and \(x=0.034\)) shows properties compatible with the \(s_{\pm}\) order parameter symmetry without line nodes in the gaps. Upon doping the system presents a stronger interdependence between the two bands, probably caused by scattering induced by the Fe-Ni substitution. No sign of a QCP was found in the variation of the penetration depth low temperature value upon doping, due to the low number of available data and possibly to the fact that the disorder induced increase of \(\lambda_{L}(0)\) hides the QCP peak.
