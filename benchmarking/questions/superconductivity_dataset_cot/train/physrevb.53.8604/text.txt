###### Abstract

We report a strong rare-earth size dependence of \(T_{c}\) in \(R\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) (\(R\) = rare earth, \(z\)\(\approx\) 7.2) compounds, unlike in \(R\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{y}\) compounds. A strong correlation is observed between the superconducting transition temperature and the orthorhombicity of the structure, which itself is \(R\)-size dependent. Orthorhombicity is highest for HoSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) and ErSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) compounds, which also have yielded the highest \(T_{c}\) (\(\approx\) 42 K). Significantly, TbSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) stabilizes in a 1-2-3 structure and also superconducts (\(T_{c}\)\(\approx\) 22 K), whereas EuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) does not superconduct, although it forms a single phase.

## I Introduction

In general, in a series of superconducting materials in which the rare-earth (\(R\)) element is a variable, \(T_{c}\) is observed to be \(R\) dependent. Most commonly this arises due to the magnetic interaction of the \(R\) moment with the conduction electrons. In addition, \(R\) size also may affect \(T_{c}\) . In the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates \(R\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{y}\) , however, \(T_{c}\) is nearly independent of \(R\) ions, i.e., independent of the size as well as the magnetic moment of the \(R\) ions. [1] We have been on the lookout for those cuprate systems of 1-2-3 structure wherein such effects may be observed. We have observed these effects in \(R\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\).

The orthorhombic layered perovskitelike crystal structure of YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) is unstable for the composition YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{z}\) . Replacement of Ba by Sr causes drastic changes in the bond distances and the 1-2-3 structure becomes unstable. The solid solubility limit of Sr in YBa\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) is in the range 0\(\leq\)x\(\leq\) 1.2, and for \(x\)\(>\) 1.2, the structure could only be stabilized under high-pressure conditions, [2] resulting in a low \(T_{c}\) (\(\approx\) 18 K) with a very broad transition width (\(\Delta T\)\(\approx\) 40 K). An increase in Sr content results in a loss of oxygen from the lattice, leading to a decrease in the stability of the crystal structure and suppression of superconductivity. Thus, there are two aspects which are intimately connected with the substitution of Sr at Ba sites, namely, (i) stability of the crystallographic structure and (ii) superconductivity and its relationship with structure. It has been shown that the orthorhombic layered perovskite-like 1-2-3 structure can be stabilized and superconductivity induced in YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{z}\) by partial replacement of Cu by a number of metal (\(M\)) cations (\(M\) = Fe, Al, Co, W, Mo, Re, etc.). [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Introduction of \(M\) cations into the lattice stabilizes the structure by providing extra oxygen to the crystal lattice to countertail the loss of oxygen caused by Sr substitution at Ba sites. It should be pointed out that attempts to synthesize compounds with \(M\) = Zn and Ni have not been successful. [4] This is attributed to the fact that both Ni and Zn ions are divalent and, therefore, do not "bring" enough oxygen into the crystal lattice, rendering the lattice unstable.

In order to investigate the effects associated with the structural and superconducting properties as a function of different \(R\) ions, we synthesized compounds belonging to the system YSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) , where \(R\) = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu. It turned out that these materials exhibit a very interesting structure-superconductivity correlation. The purpose of this paper is to report our results on this correlation. Aspects connected with the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism will be presented in our forthcoming publication.

## II Experiment

Following the solid state synthesis route, polycrystalline compounds of \(R\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) (\(R\) = lanthanides and Y) were prepared starting with high purity (\(\geq\) 99.99%) chemicals. In each case, the stoichiometric mixture of the powders was calcined for 12 h at 1000 \({}^{\circ}\)C followed by regriding and pelletization. The pellets were sintered in flowing oxygen at 1055 \({}^{\circ}\)C for all rare earths and Y (except for Tm, which was sintered at 980 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Pellets were slow cooled to 500 \({}^{\circ}\)C (1 \({}^{\circ}\)C/min) and annealed for 10 h and then slow cooled (1 \({}^{\circ}\)C/min) to room temperature. The phase purity of the compounds was determined by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). Four probe electrical resistance measurements in the range 300-12 K were carried out using a closed cycle helium cryocooler. ac magnetic susceptibility (in a field of \(\sim\) 0.1 Oe and 313 Hz) measurements were carried out using an ac susceptometer.

  

## III Results and Discussion

XRD patterns obtained on _R_Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) (_R_ = Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Y) compounds showed single-phase formation (Fig. 1). Minor impurity peaks (marked with an asterisk) were present for \(R\) = Eu, Gd, and Tm. All these compounds have orthorhombic crystal structure with \(a\) - and \(b\) -lattice parameter values quite close to each other (Table 1). We must point out here that the material TbSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re \({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) is stabilized in the 1-2-3 phase. This is in contrast with the situation in the case of TbBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{z}\), which is a multiphase material and does not stabilize in the 1-2-3 phase.8 This behavior perhaps is due to the higher stability of the phase BaTbO\({}_{3}\) as compared to that of TbBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{y}\). In the case of Sr-based systems, the reverse seems to be true. A similar kind of phase stabilization was reported by Xiong _et al._9 in TbSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.70}\)Mo\({}_{0.30}\)O\({}_{z}\). We strongly believe that Tb ions must be trivalent in this system like other ions such as Y, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm. _L_\({}_{\rm III}\)-edge studies should be useful to confirm this aspect. Compounds with \(R\) = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Yb, and Lu were multiphase.

 the range 1.004-1.019 A, superconduct with the highest transition temperature [_T__c_(max) ~ 42 K]. \(T_{c}\) is substantially reduced in compounds with \(R\) ionic radius outside this range. For instance, \(T_{c}\) is considerably reduced for Tm [smaller ionic radius (Tm(IR)-0.994 A)] and Tb and Dy [larger ionic radius (Tb(IR)-1.040 A, Dy(IR)- 1.027 A)]. This shows that \(T_{c}\) does not vary monotonously as a function of the radius of the \(R\) ions. Orthorhombicity (_e_), also, like \(T_{c}\), does not exhibit a monotonous variation with the size of the \(R\) ion. _Remarkably, T__c_ and _orthorhombicity exhibit a similar trend as a function of R size._ A strong correlation between \(T_{c}\) and \(e\) is shown in Fig. 3. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the plot of the variation of \(T_{c}\) as a function of orthorhombicity (_e_) for _R_Sr2Cu2.85Re0.15O2 (_R_ = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Y) compounds. The observed straight line fit also clearly shows that (i) \(T_{c}\) and \(e\) vary very similarly as a function of \(R\) ionic size; (ii) there exists a strong correlation between \(e\) or \(T_{c}\) and \(R\) ionic size. It is to be pointed out here that orthorhombicity in _R_Ba2Cu3O7 varies monotonously with RE ionic size.11 The following important implications are inferred from the correlation between \(T_{c}\) and _e_: (1) The magnetic moment of the \(R\) ion is not responsible for the depression of \(T_{c}\). (YSr2Cu2.85Re0.15O2 (Y has no magnetic moment) and \(\text{HoS}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{Cu}_{2.85}\text{Re}_{0.15}\text{O}_{\text{c}}\) (ground state magnetic moment of Ho =10.63_m__b_) have nearly the same \(T_{c}\) (~ 42 K). In fact, the \(\text{HoS}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{Cu}_{2.85}\text{Re}_{0.15}\text{O}_{\text{c}}\) compound has a slightly higher \(T_{c}\) (~ 42 K) as compared to that of \(\text{YSr}_{2}\text{Cu}_{2.85}\text{Re}_{0.15}\text{O}_{\text{c}}\) (\(T_{c}\)  44 K). (2) EuSr2Cu2.85Re0.15O2 stabilizes in single phase, although, with much reduced \(e\) (~ 0), and has an oxygen stoichiometry close to 7. This effect is clearly due to the variation in \(R\) size; magnetism does not play any role here simply because trivalent Eu ions have \(J\) = 0 and are, therefore, nonmagnetic. This study quite interestingly suggests that in these materials not only having the "right" amount of oxygen content is enough for superconductivity to occur, but also it is essential to have the "right" degree of orthorhombicity.6 With decreasing rare

Compounds for \(R\) = Er, Ho, and Y lie in the plateau region of maximum \(T_{c}\). . A close \(T_{c}\) value of HoSr2Cu2.85Re0.15O2 and \(\text{YSr}_{2}\text{Cu}_{2.85}\text{Re}_{0.15}\text{O}_{\text{c}}\) compounds shows that only \(R\) size dependence is responsible for the observed \(T_{c}\) variation. The magnetic moment has no role to play. A remarkable feature is the similar trend which \(T_{c}\) and \(e\) exhibit as a function of \(R\) ionic size. Extension of the (dashed) curve beyond Tb indicates, within the accuracy of our experimental results, that GdSr2Cu1.85Re0.15O2 (with a small orthorhombicity) shows only an onset of metallicity (~ 25 K), whereas EuSr2Cu2.85Re0.15O2 is tetragonal (_e_ = 0) and does not superconduct. The inset shows the variation of \(T_{c}\) as a function of orthorhombicity in _R_Sr2Cu2.85Re0.15O2 (_R_ = Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Y) compounds.

  earth size from Tb to Dy, _T\({}_{c}\) increases_, attains a maximum value for (Ho, Er, and Y compounds), and then _decreases_. It is conceivable that this behavior is a manifestation of the variation of the hole density that may occur as a result of subtle variations in bond lengths due to the variation of \(R\) size. For example, in Y\({}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-x}\)\(M_{x}\)O\({}_{y}\) it has been established that _T\({}_{c}\)_ is a function of hole doping which can be varied by varying the Ca concentration.[7] Thus, Hall-effect measurements should be very informative on this aspect.

We have synthesized a compound Tm\({}_{0.71}\)Eu\({}_{0.29}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) which forms in single phase. The weighted average rare-earth ionic radius in this compound is close to that of Ho [ionic radius \(\approx\) 1.015 A (Ref. [12])]. On the basis of the dependence of _T\({}_{c}\)_ on rare-earth ionic radius as presented above, we expect qualitatively the _T\({}_{c}\)_ of this compound to be higher than that of TmSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) (_T\({}_{c}\)_ = 23 K) and EuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) (semiconducting). _It is instructive to note that T\({}_{c}\) of the above mixed composition is considerably high_ (\(\approx\) _34 K). This is consistent with the results presented above.

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion we have presented results of our studies on the single-phase compounds of _R_Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) (_R_ = Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm). Superconductivity is observed in compounds with \(R\) =Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm. Compounds with \(R\) =La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Yb, and Lu are multiphase. In the superconducting compounds, _T\({}_{c}\)_ varies strongly as a function of the size of the \(R\) ion. Interestingly, orthorhombicity also exhibits a similar trend as that of \(R\) size. This brings out a remarkable relationship between _T\({}_{c}\)_ and orthorhombicity. Two other interesting results are that (1) TbSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) forms in single phase and superconductors (_T\({}_{c.0}\)_\(\approx\) 22 K), in this series, whereas in the Ba analog TbBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{y}\) does not form in single phase and hence does not superconduct and (2) EuSr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) is the nonsuperconducting analog of 1-2-3 compounds with O\({}_{y}\) stoichiometry. The one delineating feature of this study is that superconductivity and structural properties are very sensitive to the variation of the \(R\) size. Such a behavior has not been observed before in 1-2-3 analog. Consistent with the above findings, the "mixed" compound Tm\({}_{0.71}\)Eu\({}_{0.29}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.85}\)Re\({}_{0.15}\)O\({}_{z}\) has a _T\({}_{c}\)_ \(\approx\) 34 K, higher than that of the individual members. We also have observed similar kinds of strong variation of _T\({}_{c}\)_ with \(R\) ions in _R_Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2.8}\)W\({}_{0.2}\)O\({}_{y}\) compounds and we believe that such effects may occur in other Sr-based and _M_-stabilized 1-2-3-phase _R_Sr\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3-x}\)\(M_{y}\)O\({}_{z}\) (_M_ = Al, Fe, Co, Cr, Mo, etc.).[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
