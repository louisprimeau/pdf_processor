###### Abstract

We present a thermodynamic study of the phase diagram of single-crystal
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ using specific-heat measurements. In zero-magnetic
field a clear step in the heat capacity of ΔC/T_(c)=0.1 J/mol K² is
observed at T_(c)≈ 34.6 K for a sample with x=0.4. This material is
characterized by extraordinarily high slopes of the upper critical field
of $\mu_{0}\partial F_{c2}^{\rm d}/\partial T$=−6.5 T/K and
$\mu_{0}\partial F_{c2}^{\rm d}/\partial T$=−17.4 T/K and a surprisingly
low anisotropy of Γ∼ 2.6 near T_(c). A consequence of the large field
scale is the effective suppression of superconducting fluctuations.
Using thermodynamic relations we determine Ginzburg-Landau parameters of
κ_(c)∼ 100 and κ_(ab)∼ 260 identifying Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ as extreme
type II. The large value of the normalized discontinuity of the slopes
of the specific heat at T_(c), (T_(c)/ΔC)Δ(dC/dT)_(T_(c))∼ 6, indicates
strong coupling effects in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂.

The recent discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x)
(Ref. 1) at 26 K has led to the emergence of two new families of layered
high-temperature superconductors: the electron-doped 1111 compounds with
compositions REFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) and rare earths (REs) = Sm, Ce, Nd,
Pr, Gd, Tb, Dy, and the hole-doped 122 compounds² with composition
A_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ and A = Ba, Sr. The substitution of Fe with Co or
Ni leads to electron-doped 122 materials.^(3, 4) Currently,
SmFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) has the highest value of T_(c) of the 1111
compounds at 55 K (Ref. 5) and Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (x∼ 0.4) has the
highest T_(c) of the 122 compounds at 38 K.² Common to both groups is
that the parent compounds undergo a transition to an antiferromagnetic
ground state that is accompanied by a structural transition.⁶ Upon
doping, these transitions are suppressed and superconductivity arises.
This proximity to magnetism might lead to unconventional superconducting
pairing and gaps. The availability of sizable single crystals of the 122
compounds^(7, 8) has enabled measurements that have greatly advanced the
understanding of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂, for instance, through the
determination of the superconducting gap structure and Fermi surface in
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments.⁹ ⁻ ¹⁴ The
upper critical field, H_(c2), and its anisotropy are fundamental bulk
characteristics that shed additional light on the microscopic length
scales and the Fermi-surface topology of this recently discovered
superconductor.

Here we present a thermodynamic study of the phase diagram of
single-crystal Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ using specific-heat measurements.
In zero-magnetic field a clear step in the heat capacity of ΔC/T_(c)=0.1
J/mol K² is observed at T_(c)≈ 34.6 K. Using an entropy conserving
construction we determine the field dependence of the transition
temperature and observe extraordinarily high slopes of the upper
critical field $\mu_{0}\partial F_{c2}^{\rm d}/\partial T$=−6.5 T/K and
$\mu_{0}\partial H_{c2}^{\rm d}/\partial T$=−17.4 T/K and a surprisingly
low anisotropy of Γ∼ 2.6 near T_(c). A consequence of this large field
scale is the effective suppression of superconducting fluctuations. A
thermodynamic analysis yields Ginzburg-Landau parameters of κ_(c)∼ 100
and κ_(ab)∼ 260 identifying Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ as extreme type II.
The large value of the normalized discontinuity of the slopes of the
specific heat at T_(c), (T_(c)/ΔC)Δ(dC/dT)_(T_(c))∼ 6, indicates strong
coupling effects in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂.

The Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ crystals used in this study have a nominal
composition of x=0.4 and were grown from a FeAs self-flux as described
in Ref. 8. We performed the calorimetric measurements using a
membrane-based steady-state ac microcalorimeter.¹⁵ It utilizes a
thermocouple composed of Au-1.7

Figure 1 shows the specific heat as C/T (J/mol K²) for various fields
applied parallel to the c axis and parallel to the ab planes,
respectively. In zero field the specific heat displays a clear steplike
anomaly with a width of ∼0.5 K at the superconducting transition. With
increasing applied field this step broadens and shifts systematically to
lower temperatures. The transition width increases roughly like H^(2/3)
[inset of Fig. 1(b)], indicative for field-induced superconducting
fluctuation effects (see below). In contrast to the data in Fig. 1(a),
for the single-layer NdFeAsO_(0.82)F_(0.18) compound a magnetic field of
about 3 T along the c axis almost completely suppresses the
specific-heat anomaly.¹⁶ The reason for this different behavior lies in
superconducting fluctuations and their field dependence. Whereas the
zero-field Ginzburg number G_(i)=(8π²k_(B)Tλ_(ab)²/Φ₀²ξ_(c))^(2/2) is
roughly the same for both materials, G_(i)∼ 2× 10⁻³, the in-field
Ginzburg numbers¹⁷ G_(i)(H)=[$H/H_{c2}^{\rm d}(0)$]^(2/3)G_(i)^(1/3) are
strongly different. Here, $H_{c2}^{\rm d}(0)$=−(dH_(c2)/dT)_(T_(c))T_(c)
is the zero-temperature GL upper critical field. Since for
Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂$H_{c2}^{\rm d}(0)$ is about six times larger than
for NdFeAsO_(0.82)F_(0.18) a field of 18 T would be required to achieve
the same effect as a field of 3 T induced for NdFeAsO_(0.82)F_(0.18)
thus accounting for the reduced effect of superconducting fluctuations
in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂.

We use an entropy conserving construction [16; 18; 19] to approximate
the measured transition by an ideal step as indicated in Fig. 1(a)
thereby determining the transition temperature as a function of field.
The resulting phase diagram is shown in Fig. 2. For fields below 8 T the
upper critical field is linear in temperature with slopes of
μ₀∂H_(c2)^(c)/∂T = -6.5 T/K and μ₀∂H_(c2)^(c)/∂T = -17.4 T/K
corresponding to a low superconducting anisotropy of Γ∼ 2.6. These
values for the upper critical-field slopes and anisotropy are larger
than determinations based on magnetoresistance measurements on similar
single crystals.[20] Considering the low value of the anisotropy these
slopes are extraordinarily high. For comparison, Nb₃Sn has upper
critical-field slope of -2.3 T/K whereas that of the Chevrel phase
PbMo₆S₈ is -6 to -7 T/K and that of YBa₂Cu₃O_(7 − δ) (anisotropy ∼5-7)
is around -12 T/K for H∥ab. The upper critical-field slopes and
anisotropy of Ba_(0.6)K_(0.0)Fe₂As₂ are though comparable to those of
the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn₈ with T_(c)∼ 2.4 K.[21] The
zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence lengths of
Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂ are ξ_(ab)≈ 1.2 nm and ξ_(c)≈ 0.45 nm, and the
zero-temperature upper critical fields can be estimated using the
single-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula
H_(c2)(0)=−0.69T_(c)(∂H_(c2)/∂T_(c) as H_(c2)^(c)(0) = 155 T and
H_(c2)^(ab)(0) = 415 T. These estimates are clearly larger than the
paramagnetic limiting field μ₀H_(P)(T) =1.84T_(c)(K) = 64 T for weak
spin-orbit scattering. The Maki parameter α=$\sqrt{2}$H_(c2)(0)/H_(P)
describing the relative strength of orbital pair breaking and
paramagnetic limiting reaches values of 3.4 and 9 for the c axis and ab
plane, respectively. Since Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ is composed mostly of
low-Z elements spin-orbit scattering may be weak and paramagnetic
limiting effects such as a first-order transition into the normal state
might arise at low temperatures as have been observed for CeCoIn₈.[21;
22]

Recently, high-field measurements of the magnetoresistance[23] and rf
penetration[24] on crystals of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ with critical
temperatures of 28 and 29.5 K, respectively, and of the
magnetoresistance[25] of a Ba(Fe_(0.9)Co_(0.1))₂As₂ crystal with T_(c)∼
22 K have been performed. The observed upper critical fields lie well
below 100 T in accordance with the trend that H_(c2)(0) is strongly
reduced for decreasing T_(c) (Ref. [20]) thereby strongly decreasing the
Maki parameter as well. A remarkable finding in these high-field
measurements is the strong decrease in the anisotropy with decreasing
temperature. This behavior is in contrast to that of
SmFeAsO_(0.8)F_(0.2) (Ref. [26]) and the two

band superconductor MgB₂ (Ref. [27]) for both of which the anisotropy
increases with decreasing temperature. In the temperature range close to
T_(c) covered in Fig. 2 our data reveal–within the experimental
uncertainties–a temperature independent anisotropy.

Band structure calculations [10, 28] of the hole doped
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ reveal four Fermi-surface sheets, two concentric
corrugated cylindrical electron surfaces around the X point of the
body-centered-tetragonal Brillouin zone and two hole barrels around the
Γ point. The outer hole barrel is characterized by pronounced z-axis
dispersion giving it quasi-three-dimensional (quasi-3D) character. This
dispersion is found to depend sensitively on the doping level and the
position of the As atoms with respect to the Fe sheet. The hole surfaces
have low and the electron cylinders have high Fermi velocities. ARPES
measurements [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 29] are largely consistent with
this structure. The quasi-3D band could account for the low anisotropy
of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂. However, ARPES measurements also reveal a
large superconducting gap on the inner hole barrel and on the electron
cylinders and a small gap on the outer hole barrel. Therefore, at low
temperatures and high fields where the large superconducting gaps on the
more two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surface sheets become dominant the
anisotropy should increase. This is the behavior of MgB₂ where the large
gap resides on the 2D σ bands and the smaller gap on the 3D π bands. The
observed decrease in the anisotropy of Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ with
decreasing temperature suggests a different mechanism such as
paramagnetic limiting as discussed above.

The entropy conserving construction in Fig. 1(a) yields a zero-field
jump in the specific heat of ΔC/T_(c) =0.1 J/mol K², in good agreement
with a previous report. [30] This jump in the specific heat–when
expressed in units of J/m³ K²–is related to the thermodynamic critical
field H_(c) through the relation μ₀ΔC/T_(c)=(μ₀dH_(c)/dT)_(T_(c))²
resulting in a slope of −45 mT/K of μ₀H_(c) at T_(c). Using the
single-band weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) relation the
zero-temperature thermodynamic critical field of
μ₀H_(c)(0)=−0.576(dH_(c)/dT)_(T_(c))T_(c)= 0.9 T can be estimated.
Strong coupling effects would reduce this value. In the Ginzburg-Landau
regime, H_(c)(Γ) is linear in temperature and is given by
H_(c)(Γ)=$\Phi_{0}/[2\sqrt{2}\pi\mu_{0}\Delta_{ab}^{\rm GL}(T)\xi_{ab}(\Gamma)]$
with $\Delta_{ab}^{\rm GL}(\Gamma)$
=$\lambda_{ab}^{\rm GL}/(1-T/T_{c})^{1/2}$ which yields an in-plane
GL-penetration depth of $\lambda_{ab}^{\rm GL}$= 125 nm. Then, the
Ginzburg-Landau parameters κ_(c)=$\lambda_{ab}^{\rm GL}/\xi_{ab}$≈ 100
and
κ_(ab)=($\lambda_{ab}^{\rm GL}\lambda_{c}^{\rm GL})^{1/2}/(\xi_{ab}\xi_{c})^{1/2}$≈
260 can be obtained identifying this material as extreme type II.
Accordingly, the slopes of the lower critical fields
dH_(c1)^(′)/dT≅dH_(c)/dT[ln (κ_(l))×0.5]/(⟨2κ_(l)⟩ are low:
μ₀dH_(c1)^(′)/dT≈−1.6 mT/K and μ₀dH_(c1)^(ab)/dT≈−0.74 mT/K,
respectively. Recent magnetic measurements [31] of the lower critical
field of similar samples yielded slopes of H_(c1)^(c) at T_(c) of ∼−1.8
mT/K underlining the consistency of our thermodynamic analysis. The
actual low-temperature penetration depth is larger than the GL value and
can be estimated [32] as λ_(ab)≈$\langle 2\lambda_{ab}^{\rm GL}$≈ 175 nm
which is in reasonable agreement with experimental determinations from
optical measurements. [33]

Evidence for strong coupling effects arises from the value of the
normalized discontinuity of the slopes of the specific heat at T_(c),
(T_(c)/ΔC)Δ(dC/dT)_(T_(c)). In single-band weak-coupling BCS theory this
ratio is 2.64. In strong coupling Pb it is 4.6 (Ref. [32]) whereas in
the two-band superconductor MgB₂ a value of 3.35 can be deduced. [19]
From the data in Fig. 1(a) we obtain a very large value of
(T_(c)/ΔC)Δ(dC/dT)_(T_(c))∼ 6 indicative of pronounced strong coupling
effects. Strong coupling can also be inferred from the large value of
the gap ratio 2Δ/k_(B)T_(c)∼ 6.8-8, [14] which in weak-coupling BCS
theory is 3.53. We note, though, that in the presence of multiple
superconducting gaps ratios such as ΔC/γ_(n)T_(c), 2Δ/k_(B)T_(c), or
(T_(c)/ΔC)Δ(dC/dT)_(T_(c)) are not universal constants but will depend
on the specifics of the gaps.

Figure 3(a) shows the angular dependence of the transition temperature
T_(c2)(θ) in a field of 6 T. Within the effective-mass model of the
Ginzburg-Landau theory of anisotropic superconductors and assuming
linear phase boundaries, T_(c2)(θ) is given by
T_(c2)(θ)=T_(c0)+H∖$\overline{\cos^{2}(\theta)+\Gamma^{2}\sin^{2}(\theta)}/(\langle dH_{c2}^{ab}/\partial T\rangle$.
Here, θ is the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the FeAs
planes and T_(c0) is

the zero-field transition temperature. A fit with Γ = 2.56 describes the
data reasonably well. However, there are small systematic deviations by
which the measured values fall below the GL fit. These are more clearly
visible when plotting the deviations
$(T_{c2}^{\rm GL}$−T_(c0))²/(T_(c2)−T_(c0))² as a function of cos²(θ)
[Fig. 3(b)]. A similar trend in the data has been observed for MgB₂,
which could be accounted for in a model of two-band
superconductivity.[34] Although detailed calculations have not yet been
performed the data in Fig. 3 are suggestive for multiple superconducting
gaps in Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂.

In summary, we have determined the upper critical field of
single-crystal Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂ using specific-heat measurements.
The upper critical-field slopes are very high, ∂$H_{c2}^{\rm c}$/∂T=−6.5
T/K and ∂$H_{c2}^{\rm pd}$/∂T=−17.4 T/K, which correspond–in a
single-band model–to zero-temperature GL coherence lengths of ξ_(ab) ≈
1.2 nm and ξ_(c) ≈ 0.45 nm and a low superconducting anisotropy of Γ ∼
2.6. The very high critical-field slopes may enable the observation of
paramagnetic limiting effects at low temperatures. A thermodynamic
analysis yields Ginzburg-Landau parameters of κ_(c) ∼ 100 and κ_(ab) ∼
260 identifying Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ as extreme type II. The large
value of the normalized discontinuity of the slopes of the specific heat
at T_(c), (T_(c)/ΔΔ(dC/dT)_(T_(c)) ∼ 6 indicates strong coupling effects
in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂.
