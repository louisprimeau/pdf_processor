###### Abstract

Single crystals of Rb1-xFe2-ySe2 are successfully synthesized with superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}\approx 31-32.5 K. A clear humplike anomaly of resistivity was observed in the normal state in the temperature region T_{an} of 150 K-186 K, as found in a similar system, K_{x}Fe2-ySe2. It is found that the Meissner screening volume and the superconducting transition temperatures are higher for the sample with higher T_{an}, indicating that the hump of resistivity is strongly related to the superconductivity. The upper critical field has been determined with the magnetic field along the _ab_ plane and c axis for two typical samples with different T_{an}, yielding an anisotropy of \Gamma\approx 3.5 when T_{an} = 150 K, while \Gamma\approx 4.8 when T_{an} = 186 K. The angle-dependent resistivity measured below T_{c} allow a perfect scaling feature based on the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory, leading to consistent values of the anisotropy. Comparing with the anisotropy determined for Ba0_{x}K0_{x}K0_{x}Fe2As2 and Ba(Fe0_{x}0_{x}K0_{x}0_{x}0_{x})_{2}As2 using the same method, we find that the present sample is more anisotropic and the Fermi surfaces with stronger two-dimensional characters are expected.

## I Introduction

Iron pnictide superconductors have received tremendous attention in past two years since Kamihara _et al._ reported superconductivity at 26 K in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}.[1] The family of the FeAs-based superconductors has been expanded rapidly. A typical example is the (Ba,Sr)Fe_{2}As_{2} (denoted as FeAs-122) system: The antiferromagnetic order is suppressed, and superconductivity is induced by either K doping in the Ba or Sr sites[2, 3, 4] or Co and Ni doping in the Fe sites.[5, 6] On the other hand, superconductivity was also found in the FeAs-based parent phase LiFeAs (denoted as FeAs-111)[7, 8, 9] and Sr_{2}VO_{3}FeAs (denoted as FeAs-21311).[10] Compared with these iron pnictides, FeSe has a more simple structure of only FeSe layers and no toxic arsenic,[11] which shows superconductivity at 8 K at ambient pressure and the transition temperature can be increased dramatically to 37 K under high pressure.[12] Moreover, a recent report showed that superconducting and magnetic properties of Fe_{x}Se_{x}Te_{1-x} not only depend on the concentration ratio of Se/Te, but also strongly depend on the interstitial Fe content.[13] Additionally, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(ARPES) showed that the normal state of FeSe0_{x}Fe0_{x}58 is a strongly correlated metal, which is significantly different from the FeAs-1111 and FeAs-122 systems.[14] Therefore, the FeSe-layered materials deserve intensive studies for both fundamental physics and potential applications.

Very recently, superconductivity at around 30 K was reported in K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} (denoted as FeSe-122),[15] where the potassium ions could be intercalated between the Fe_{2}Se_{2} layers. This discovery was quickly repeated by other groups with the nominal composition K0_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}.[16] Introducing potassium into the system makes the structure change from 11-type(P4/mmm) to 122-type(I4/mmm). Up to now, system FeSe-122 has given the highest T_{c} among the FeSe-layered compounds under ambient pressure. Shortly after that, Krzton-Maziopa _et al._ reported the crystal growth of an analog compound Cs0_{x}(FeSe_{0.98})_{2}.[17] Furthermore, Fang _et al.[18]_ synthesized the systematically doped (Tl,K)Fe_{2-x}Se_{2} and found that the superconductivity might be in proximity to a Mott insulator. If just counting on the electron numbers, one would assume that A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} (A = alkaline metals) might be a purely electron doped sample. Thus it is curious to know whether the Fermi surfaces are close to or far different from their relatives Ba(Sr)Fe_{2}As_{2}. The anisotropy is one of the important parameters that characterize the electronic properties. In this paper, we report the successful synthesis of the new superconductors Rb1-xFe_{2-y}Se_{2}. The transition temperatures are estimated to be 31 K-32.5 K. We also present the temperature, magnetic field, and angle dependence of resistivity. Our results point to a higher anisotropy in Rb1-xFe2-ySe2 compared with electron- and hole-doped Ba(Sr)Fe_{2}As_{2}.

## II Experiment

Single crystals were grown from the melt of the mixture of Rb1-xFe2-ySe2 using the Bridgeman method. First, Fe2-ySe2 powders were prepared with a high-purity powder of selenium (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) and iron (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) by a similar method described in Ref. [19] Then, Fe2-ySe2 and Rb (Alfa Aesar, 99.75%) were mixed in appropriate stoichiometry and were put into alumina crucibles and sealed in an evacuated silica ampoule. The mixture was heated up to 1030 degC and kept over 3 h. Afterward the melt was cooled down to 730 degC with a cooling rate of 6 degC/h, and finally the furnace was cooled to room temperature with the power shut off. Well-formed black crystals were obtained which could be easily cleaved into plates with flat shiny surfaces. However, the fast cooling rate and shorter time at high temperature could cause the mixture to melt nonuniformly and the resulting single crystal to be inhomogeneous. To avoid these defects, we kept the reactants at 1050 degC for 8 h and cooled it down to 700 degC at a rate of 3.5 degC/h. There is a loss of Rb from the melt, and some mixed phases are resulted which consist of the desired single crystalline phase and fine polycrystalline material. Therefore the real stoichiometries of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} crystals were determined by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The crystal structures were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The dc magnetization measurements were done with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID, Quantum Design, MPMS7). The electrical transport data were collected on a Quantum Design instrument, physical property measurement system (PPMS), with magnetic fields up to 9 T. The temperature stabilization was better than 0.1%, and the resolution of the voltmeter was better than 10 nV.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} crystals prepared by different ways. Both samples exhibit good c-axis orientation, as evidenced by the sharp (00J) peaks. The ICP data show that the real stoichiometries of the single crystals are Rb : Fe : Se = 0.76 : 1.62 : 2.00 for sample 1 grown with a fast cooling rate and Rb : Fe : Se = 0.8 : 1.68 : 2.00 for sample 2 grown with slower cooling rate.

The temperature dependence of resistivity for both single crystals of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} are presented in Fig. 2(a). A superconducting transition appears at the temperature of 31 K (onset), and the zero resistance appears at 28 K for sample 1 which is similar to that of K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}.[15] The normal state resistivity exhibits a possible semiconductor-to-metal-like transition at around 150 K. Similar behavior was also observed in K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, although in a different temperature region (about 110 K in K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}),[15] which could also be caused by a structure or magnetic phase transitions. The bulk superconductivity of our sample is also confirmed by dc magnetization measurement which is shown in Fig. 2(b); diamagnetism is clearly observed in both zero-field-cooling and field-cooling measurement. The relatively broad magnetic and resistive transitions of sample 1 may suggest that the sample is still inhomogeneous in composition or the Fe vacancy disorders. It should also be noticed that the absolute value of normal state resistivity is quite large and varies from sample to sample. The maximum value exceeds 700 m\Omega cm, which is hundreds of times larger than that in other typical iron-based superconductors. For sample 2 a higher transition temperature of 32.5 K (onset) was observed and zero resistance appeared at 31.5 K. The semiconductor-to-metal-like transition hump in normal state shifts to 186 K. The better diamagnetism and the larger Meissner screening volume were observed in dc magnetization measurements. The higher residual resistivity ratio (R300K/R32.5 K \approx 14) at 32.5 K and lower normal state resistivity with sharper superconducting transition may indicate less impurities and better homogeneity for sample 2. A rough estimate on the Meissner screening volume by assuming an uniform superconducting condensate at 2 K is about 42% and around 80% for sample 1 and sample 2, respectively. As we know, this kind of estimate is not precise and suffers a modification by counting the demagnetization factor.

In the angle-resolved resistivity measurement, the sample is rotated in the magnetic field where \theta is the angle enclosed between the external magnetic field and c axis (\theta = 0^{\circ} corresponding to the configuration of H // c axis and \theta = 90^{\circ} to H//ab plane). The current was applied in the ab plane

  and perpendicular to the magnetic field in all cases. The temperature dependence of resistivity from 15 K to 40 K with different magnetic fields applied along the _ab_ plane or c axis for two samples are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Superconducting transition broadens and is suppressed to the low temperature when applying the magnetic field both parallel to the c axis and within the _ab_ plane. We adopt a criterion of 90%_r__p_(_T_) to determine the upper critical fields. The upper critical fields of Rb1-_x_Fe2-_y_Se2 crystals are determined in this way and shown in Fig. 5. The upper critical fields _H_z_ exhibit a rather linear temperature dependence for both samples and both orientations. Thus we can easily get the values of the slope for two different directions of applying fields. For sample 1 we get -dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT|_{T_{c}} = 6.78 T/K, -dH_{c2}^{c}/dT|_{T_{c}} = 1.98 T/K. For sample 2 we have -dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT|_{T_{c}} = 8.84 T/K, -dH_{c2}^{c}/dT|_{T} = 1.92 T/K. The value of the slope of two samples for the applying magnetic field within the _ab_ plane significantly exceeds the Pauli limit 1.84 T/K, which may manifest an unconventional mechanism of superconductivity in this material. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula H_{c2}(0) = - 0.69 \times d\,H_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}} (Ref. [20]) and taking T_{c} = 31 K and 32.5 K, we can estimate the values of upper critical fields close to zero temperature limit: H_{c2}^{ab}(0) = 145 T and H_{c2}^{c}(0) = 42 T for sample 1, H_{c2}^{ab}(0) = 198 T and H_{c2}^{c}(0) = 41 T for sample 2. In determining the _H_z_(_T_) near T_{c}, we used only a relatively low magnetic field; in this case the Zeeman energy is still quite low, and the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) which determines the pair-breaking energy is actually determined by the orbital momentum. Therefore the method we used (the anisotropy derived by the ratio of the upper critical field to the magnetic field along different directions) should be applicable. On the other hand, in the low-temperature region, the upper critical field is very high, and the magnetic interaction will become much stronger compared with the momentum energy; therefore the Pauli limit governs the behavior of H_{c2}(T). According to the Lawrence-Doniach model,[21] the relation between the anisotropy \Gamma and the upper critical field is given by

\[\Gamma = (m_{c}/m_{ab})^{1/2} = \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} = H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c},\]

where H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c} are the upper critical fields with H\parallel ab plane and H\parallel c axis, m_{c} and m_{ab} are the effective masses when the electrons move along the c axis and _ab_ plane, and \xi_{ab} and \xi_{c} are coherence length in the _ab_ plane and along the c axis, respectively. From the above data, we can get the anisotropy of the upper critical fields of Rb0.76Fe1.62Se2, \Gamma\approx 3.5 and Rb0.8Fe1.68Se2, \Gamma\approx 4.8. As a result of faster cooling and a shorter time at a high temperature for sample 1, more impurities and defects may form which are distributed randomly and

  scatter electrons isotropically. The anisotropy of sample 1 is lower than that of sample 2 which may be due to the impurities and defects mashing some instinct anisotropy in these kind of materials. The anisotropy value 4.8 is higher than that in K0.8Fe2Se2 (\Gamma\approx 3.6) [16] and all are quite small compared with high-T_{c} cuprates, which indicates an encouraging application perspective.

Considering the uncertainties in determining the upper critical field in different formulas and by different criteria, the anisotropy ratio may subject to a modification. One major concern was that the zero-temperature value H_{c2}(0) was determined by using the experimental data near T_{c}; this concern can be removed by the measurements of angular-dependent resistivity. According to the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory, the effective upper critical field H_{c2}^{GL}(\theta) at an angle \theta is given by

\[H_{c2}^{GL}(\theta)=H_{c2}^{ab}/\sqrt{\sin^{2}(\theta)+\Gamma^{2}\cos^{2}( \theta)}.\] (2)

The resistivity at different magnetic fields but a fixed temperature can be scaled with the variable H/H_{c2}^{GL}(\theta). Thus by adjusting \Gamma, the proper scaling variable \widetilde{H} = H\sqrt{\sin^{2}(\theta)+\Gamma^{2}\cos^{2}(\theta)} is acquired, and then the resistivity measured at different magnetic fields should collapse onto one curve. [22] Figure 6 presents the data of angular dependence of resistivity at 27 K, 28 K for sample 1. At some temperatures, a very small peak centered around \theta = 90^{\circ} is observed. Normally the resistivity is the lowest when H\parallel_ab_ plane. The little peak appeared at \theta = 90^{\circ} could be induced by the weak flux pinning channel along the _ab_ plane. This may suggest that there is inhomogeneity along the c axis, which makes the flux easy to move when the field is exactly aligned parallel to _ab_ planes. The curves measured at different magnetic fields but at a fixed temperature are scaled nicely by adjusting \Gamma. In this treatment only one fitting parameter \Gamma is employed in the scaling for each temperature, so the value of \Gamma is more reliable than the one determined from the ratio of H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c}, which may be affected by using different criterion. At 27 K and 28 K the anisotropies \Gamma are found to be 2.9 \pm 0.2 and 3 \pm 0.2, respectively. The results agree very well with the value determined by the ratio of H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c}, which implies the validity of the values determined in this work. It is interesting to mention that the anisotropy determined using the ratio of H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c} is quite close to that determined using the normal state resistivity \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} at around T_{c} by Hu _et al._[23] Though an abnormal cusp at 90^{\circ} can be observed in the inset of Fig. 6 which suggests some impurities or defect scattering, the sufficient data at other angles can also give a good scaling curves at different magnetic fields. In the same way, the \Gamma obtained at 29 K and 30 K are 3.3 \pm 0.1 and 3.6 \pm 0.1, which are a little larger than those at 27 K and 28 K. The anisotropy produced by the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory is agreeable with that produced by the ratio of upper critical field. The data of angular dependence of resistivity at 29 K, 30 K for sample 2 are presented in Fig. 7. No abnormal cusp-shaped feature centered around \theta = 90^{\circ} like sample 1 is observed, and the data at different magnetic fields can nicely scale onto one curve. In the same method the anisotropy of sample 2 at 27 K, 28 K, 29 K, 30 K, and 31 K are derived to be 3.5 \pm 0.1, 4.1 \pm 0.08, 4.4 \pm 0.04, 4.85 \pm 0.04, and 5 \pm 0.02 respectively. The \Gamma is agreeable with the former value determined by the ratio of upper critical field and higher than that of sample 1. Due

The inset presents the angular dependence of resistance for the Rb_{0.78}Fe_{1.62}Se_{2} single crystal (sample 1).

  to the slow cooling and longer time at high temperatures in the growth process, there are less impurities and defects with lower resistivity in the normal state and a higher residual resistivity ratio (R300K/R32K  14) in sample 2. Correspondingly, the semiconductor-to-metal-like transition hump in normal state shifts to 186 K, which coincides with the large Meissner screening volume and the sharper superconductivity transition. Compared with the anisotropy in other FeAs-based superconductors, the value of anisotropy is similar to 5 in NdFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and higher than 2-2.5 in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}.

The anisotropy determined by the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory at different temperatures of Rb_{0.76}Fe_{1.62}Se_{2}, Rb_{0.80}Fe_{1.68}Se_{2}, Ba_{0.63}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2}, and Ba(Fe_{0.92}Co_{0.08})_{2}As_{2} single crystals are shown in Fig. 8. It is found that the anisotropy of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} decreases slightly with decreasing temperature. This kind of temperature dependence of \Gamma(T) is consistent with other FeAs-122 superconductors, such as Ba_{0.6}K_{0.44}Fe_{2}As_{2}, Ba(Fe_{0.92}Co_{0.08})_{2}As_{2}, etc. This may be understood as the multiband effect or the effect due to the gradual setting in of pair breaking by the spin-paramagnetic effect which requires H_{c2}^{ab}=H_{c2}^{c} in the low-temperature and high-field limit. It should be noted that the good scaling behavior suggests a field-independent anisotropy in the temperature and field range are investigated.[24] The anisotropy of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} is similar to that of the FeAs-1111 family, such as NdFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}, while it is higher than that in hole- and electron-doped FeAs-122 superconductors and KFe_{2}As_{2} with the same structure.[25] It is, however, very strange that KFe_{2}As_{2} and K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, should reside in the two terminals of the phase diagram; The former is strongly hole doped, while the latter is heavily electron doped. The larger anisotropy in K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} may suggest a more two-dimensional Fermi surface in this material. The difference between the anisotropy in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} and Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} may hinge on that the latter has a less warped Fermi surface. Meanwhile, the higher superconducting transition temperature with the better diamagnetism and the sharper superconducting transition is accompanied by the higher T_{an} which indicates the hump of resistivity is closely related to the superconductivity. Our results here should be stimulating in fulfilling a quantitative calculation and further studying on the electronic structure of this new family, and ultimately providing an understanding to the underlying mechanism of superconductivity.

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, we successfully fabricated single crystals of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} with the superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}\approx 31 - 32.5 K. A clear anomaly of the resistivity was observed in the normal state at about 150-186 K. We also determined the upper critical fields along the ab plane and c axis for two typical samples with different T_{an}, which yield an anisotropy of \Gamma\approx 3.5 when T_{an} = 150 K, while \Gamma\approx 4.8 when T_{an} = 186 K. It is found that the Meissner screening volume and the superconducting transition temperatures are higher for the sample with higher T_{an}. The angle-dependent resistivity measured below T_{c} allows a perfect scaling based on the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory. The consistent value

The curves are measured at the same temperature, but different magnetic fields are scaled nicely by adjusting the value of \Gamma. The inset presents the angular dependence of resistance for the Rb_{0.8}Fe_{1.68}Se_{2} single crystal (sample 2).

  of the anisotropy is acquired which decreases from about 3.6 at 30 K around T_{\rm c} to 2.9 at 27 K for sample 1 and from about 5 at 31 K around T_{\rm c} to 3.5 at 27 K. Comparing with the anisotropy determined for Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{0.92}Co_{0.08})_{2}As_{2} using the same method, we expect that the Fermi surfaces in the new system A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} are less warped.

###### Abstract

Single crystals of Rb1-xFe2-ySe2 are successfully synthesized with superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}\approx 31-32.5 K. A clear humplike anomaly of resistivity was observed in the normal state in the temperature region T_{an} of 150 K-186 K, as found in a similar system, K_{x}Fe2-ySe2. It is found that the Meissner screening volume and the superconducting transition temperatures are higher for the sample with higher T_{an}, indicating that the hump of resistivity is strongly related to the superconductivity. The upper critical field has been determined with the magnetic field along the _ab_ plane and c axis for two typical samples with different T_{an}, yielding an anisotropy of \Gamma\approx 3.5 when T_{an} = 150 K, while \Gamma\approx 4.8 when T_{an} = 186 K. The angle-dependent resistivity measured below T_{c} allow a perfect scaling feature based on the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory, leading to consistent values of the anisotropy. Comparing with the anisotropy determined for Ba0_{x}K0_{x}K0_{x}Fe2As2 and Ba(Fe0_{x}0_{x}K0_{x}0_{x}0_{x})_{2}As2 using the same method, we find that the present sample is more anisotropic and the Fermi surfaces with stronger two-dimensional characters are expected.

## I Introduction

Iron pnictide superconductors have received tremendous attention in past two years since Kamihara _et al._ reported superconductivity at 26 K in LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}.[1] The family of the FeAs-based superconductors has been expanded rapidly. A typical example is the (Ba,Sr)Fe_{2}As_{2} (denoted as FeAs-122) system: The antiferromagnetic order is suppressed, and superconductivity is induced by either K doping in the Ba or Sr sites[2, 3, 4] or Co and Ni doping in the Fe sites.[5, 6] On the other hand, superconductivity was also found in the FeAs-based parent phase LiFeAs (denoted as FeAs-111)[7, 8, 9] and Sr_{2}VO_{3}FeAs (denoted as FeAs-21311).[10] Compared with these iron pnictides, FeSe has a more simple structure of only FeSe layers and no toxic arsenic,[11] which shows superconductivity at 8 K at ambient pressure and the transition temperature can be increased dramatically to 37 K under high pressure.[12] Moreover, a recent report showed that superconducting and magnetic properties of Fe_{x}Se_{x}Te_{1-x} not only depend on the concentration ratio of Se/Te, but also strongly depend on the interstitial Fe content.[13] Additionally, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(ARPES) showed that the normal state of FeSe0_{x}Fe0_{x}58 is a strongly correlated metal, which is significantly different from the FeAs-1111 and FeAs-122 systems.[14] Therefore, the FeSe-layered materials deserve intensive studies for both fundamental physics and potential applications.

Very recently, superconductivity at around 30 K was reported in K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} (denoted as FeSe-122),[15] where the potassium ions could be intercalated between the Fe_{2}Se_{2} layers. This discovery was quickly repeated by other groups with the nominal composition K0_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}.[16] Introducing potassium into the system makes the structure change from 11-type(P4/mmm) to 122-type(I4/mmm). Up to now, system FeSe-122 has given the highest T_{c} among the FeSe-layered compounds under ambient pressure. Shortly after that, Krzton-Maziopa _et al._ reported the crystal growth of an analog compound Cs0_{x}(FeSe_{0.98})_{2}.[17] Furthermore, Fang _et al.[18]_ synthesized the systematically doped (Tl,K)Fe_{2-x}Se_{2} and found that the superconductivity might be in proximity to a Mott insulator. If just counting on the electron numbers, one would assume that A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} (A = alkaline metals) might be a purely electron doped sample. Thus it is curious to know whether the Fermi surfaces are close to or far different from their relatives Ba(Sr)Fe_{2}As_{2}. The anisotropy is one of the important parameters that characterize the electronic properties. In this paper, we report the successful synthesis of the new superconductors Rb1-xFe_{2-y}Se_{2}. The transition temperatures are estimated to be 31 K-32.5 K. We also present the temperature, magnetic field, and angle dependence of resistivity. Our results point to a higher anisotropy in Rb1-xFe2-ySe2 compared with electron- and hole-doped Ba(Sr)Fe_{2}As_{2}.

## II Experiment

Single crystals were grown from the melt of the mixture of Rb1-xFe2-ySe2 using the Bridgeman method. First, Fe2-ySe2 powders were prepared with a high-purity powder of selenium (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) and iron (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) by a similar method described in Ref. [19] Then, Fe2-ySe2 and Rb (Alfa Aesar, 99.75%) were mixed in appropriate stoichiometry and were put into alumina crucibles and sealed in an evacuated silica ampoule. The mixture was heated up to 1030 degC and kept over 3 h. Afterward the melt was cooled down to 730 degC with a cooling rate of 6 degC/h, and finally the furnace was cooled to room temperature with the power shut off. Well-formed black crystals were obtained which could be easily cleaved into plates with flat shiny surfaces. However, the fast cooling rate and shorter time at high temperature could cause the mixture to melt nonuniformly and the resulting single crystal to be inhomogeneous. To avoid these defects, we kept the reactants at 1050 degC for 8 h and cooled it down to 700 degC at a rate of 3.5 degC/h. There is a loss of Rb from the melt, and some mixed phases are resulted which consist of the desired single crystalline phase and fine polycrystalline material. Therefore the real stoichiometries of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} crystals were determined by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The crystal structures were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The dc magnetization measurements were done with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID, Quantum Design, MPMS7). The electrical transport data were collected on a Quantum Design instrument, physical property measurement system (PPMS), with magnetic fields up to 9 T. The temperature stabilization was better than 0.1%, and the resolution of the voltmeter was better than 10 nV.

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} crystals prepared by different ways. Both samples exhibit good c-axis orientation, as evidenced by the sharp (00J) peaks. The ICP data show that the real stoichiometries of the single crystals are Rb : Fe : Se = 0.76 : 1.62 : 2.00 for sample 1 grown with a fast cooling rate and Rb : Fe : Se = 0.8 : 1.68 : 2.00 for sample 2 grown with slower cooling rate.

The temperature dependence of resistivity for both single crystals of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} are presented in Fig. 2(a). A superconducting transition appears at the temperature of 31 K (onset), and the zero resistance appears at 28 K for sample 1 which is similar to that of K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}.[15] The normal state resistivity exhibits a possible semiconductor-to-metal-like transition at around 150 K. Similar behavior was also observed in K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, although in a different temperature region (about 110 K in K_{0.8}Fe_{2}Se_{2}),[15] which could also be caused by a structure or magnetic phase transitions. The bulk superconductivity of our sample is also confirmed by dc magnetization measurement which is shown in Fig. 2(b); diamagnetism is clearly observed in both zero-field-cooling and field-cooling measurement. The relatively broad magnetic and resistive transitions of sample 1 may suggest that the sample is still inhomogeneous in composition or the Fe vacancy disorders. It should also be noticed that the absolute value of normal state resistivity is quite large and varies from sample to sample. The maximum value exceeds 700 m\Omega cm, which is hundreds of times larger than that in other typical iron-based superconductors. For sample 2 a higher transition temperature of 32.5 K (onset) was observed and zero resistance appeared at 31.5 K. The semiconductor-to-metal-like transition hump in normal state shifts to 186 K. The better diamagnetism and the larger Meissner screening volume were observed in dc magnetization measurements. The higher residual resistivity ratio (R300K/R32.5 K \approx 14) at 32.5 K and lower normal state resistivity with sharper superconducting transition may indicate less impurities and better homogeneity for sample 2. A rough estimate on the Meissner screening volume by assuming an uniform superconducting condensate at 2 K is about 42% and around 80% for sample 1 and sample 2, respectively. As we know, this kind of estimate is not precise and suffers a modification by counting the demagnetization factor.

In the angle-resolved resistivity measurement, the sample is rotated in the magnetic field where \theta is the angle enclosed between the external magnetic field and c axis (\theta = 0^{\circ} corresponding to the configuration of H // c axis and \theta = 90^{\circ} to H//ab plane). The current was applied in the ab plane

  and perpendicular to the magnetic field in all cases. The temperature dependence of resistivity from 15 K to 40 K with different magnetic fields applied along the _ab_ plane or c axis for two samples are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Superconducting transition broadens and is suppressed to the low temperature when applying the magnetic field both parallel to the c axis and within the _ab_ plane. We adopt a criterion of 90%_r__p_(_T_) to determine the upper critical fields. The upper critical fields of Rb1-_x_Fe2-_y_Se2 crystals are determined in this way and shown in Fig. 5. The upper critical fields _H_z_ exhibit a rather linear temperature dependence for both samples and both orientations. Thus we can easily get the values of the slope for two different directions of applying fields. For sample 1 we get -dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT|_{T_{c}} = 6.78 T/K, -dH_{c2}^{c}/dT|_{T_{c}} = 1.98 T/K. For sample 2 we have -dH_{c2}^{ab}/dT|_{T_{c}} = 8.84 T/K, -dH_{c2}^{c}/dT|_{T} = 1.92 T/K. The value of the slope of two samples for the applying magnetic field within the _ab_ plane significantly exceeds the Pauli limit 1.84 T/K, which may manifest an unconventional mechanism of superconductivity in this material. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula H_{c2}(0) = - 0.69 \times d\,H_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}} (Ref. [20]) and taking T_{c} = 31 K and 32.5 K, we can estimate the values of upper critical fields close to zero temperature limit: H_{c2}^{ab}(0) = 145 T and H_{c2}^{c}(0) = 42 T for sample 1, H_{c2}^{ab}(0) = 198 T and H_{c2}^{c}(0) = 41 T for sample 2. In determining the _H_z_(_T_) near T_{c}, we used only a relatively low magnetic field; in this case the Zeeman energy is still quite low, and the upper critical field H_{c2}(T) which determines the pair-breaking energy is actually determined by the orbital momentum. Therefore the method we used (the anisotropy derived by the ratio of the upper critical field to the magnetic field along different directions) should be applicable. On the other hand, in the low-temperature region, the upper critical field is very high, and the magnetic interaction will become much stronger compared with the momentum energy; therefore the Pauli limit governs the behavior of H_{c2}(T). According to the Lawrence-Doniach model,[21] the relation between the anisotropy \Gamma and the upper critical field is given by

\[\Gamma = (m_{c}/m_{ab})^{1/2} = \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} = H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c},\]

where H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c} are the upper critical fields with H\parallel ab plane and H\parallel c axis, m_{c} and m_{ab} are the effective masses when the electrons move along the c axis and _ab_ plane, and \xi_{ab} and \xi_{c} are coherence length in the _ab_ plane and along the c axis, respectively. From the above data, we can get the anisotropy of the upper critical fields of Rb0.76Fe1.62Se2, \Gamma\approx 3.5 and Rb0.8Fe1.68Se2, \Gamma\approx 4.8. As a result of faster cooling and a shorter time at a high temperature for sample 1, more impurities and defects may form which are distributed randomly and

  scatter electrons isotropically. The anisotropy of sample 1 is lower than that of sample 2 which may be due to the impurities and defects mashing some instinct anisotropy in these kind of materials. The anisotropy value 4.8 is higher than that in K0.8Fe2Se2 (\Gamma\approx 3.6) [16] and all are quite small compared with high-T_{c} cuprates, which indicates an encouraging application perspective.

Considering the uncertainties in determining the upper critical field in different formulas and by different criteria, the anisotropy ratio may subject to a modification. One major concern was that the zero-temperature value H_{c2}(0) was determined by using the experimental data near T_{c}; this concern can be removed by the measurements of angular-dependent resistivity. According to the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory, the effective upper critical field H_{c2}^{GL}(\theta) at an angle \theta is given by

\[H_{c2}^{GL}(\theta)=H_{c2}^{ab}/\sqrt{\sin^{2}(\theta)+\Gamma^{2}\cos^{2}( \theta)}.\] (2)

The resistivity at different magnetic fields but a fixed temperature can be scaled with the variable H/H_{c2}^{GL}(\theta). Thus by adjusting \Gamma, the proper scaling variable \widetilde{H} = H\sqrt{\sin^{2}(\theta)+\Gamma^{2}\cos^{2}(\theta)} is acquired, and then the resistivity measured at different magnetic fields should collapse onto one curve. [22] Figure 6 presents the data of angular dependence of resistivity at 27 K, 28 K for sample 1. At some temperatures, a very small peak centered around \theta = 90^{\circ} is observed. Normally the resistivity is the lowest when H\parallel_ab_ plane. The little peak appeared at \theta = 90^{\circ} could be induced by the weak flux pinning channel along the _ab_ plane. This may suggest that there is inhomogeneity along the c axis, which makes the flux easy to move when the field is exactly aligned parallel to _ab_ planes. The curves measured at different magnetic fields but at a fixed temperature are scaled nicely by adjusting \Gamma. In this treatment only one fitting parameter \Gamma is employed in the scaling for each temperature, so the value of \Gamma is more reliable than the one determined from the ratio of H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c}, which may be affected by using different criterion. At 27 K and 28 K the anisotropies \Gamma are found to be 2.9 \pm 0.2 and 3 \pm 0.2, respectively. The results agree very well with the value determined by the ratio of H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c}, which implies the validity of the values determined in this work. It is interesting to mention that the anisotropy determined using the ratio of H_{c2}^{ab} and H_{c2}^{c} is quite close to that determined using the normal state resistivity \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} at around T_{c} by Hu _et al._[23] Though an abnormal cusp at 90^{\circ} can be observed in the inset of Fig. 6 which suggests some impurities or defect scattering, the sufficient data at other angles can also give a good scaling curves at different magnetic fields. In the same way, the \Gamma obtained at 29 K and 30 K are 3.3 \pm 0.1 and 3.6 \pm 0.1, which are a little larger than those at 27 K and 28 K. The anisotropy produced by the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory is agreeable with that produced by the ratio of upper critical field. The data of angular dependence of resistivity at 29 K, 30 K for sample 2 are presented in Fig. 7. No abnormal cusp-shaped feature centered around \theta = 90^{\circ} like sample 1 is observed, and the data at different magnetic fields can nicely scale onto one curve. In the same method the anisotropy of sample 2 at 27 K, 28 K, 29 K, 30 K, and 31 K are derived to be 3.5 \pm 0.1, 4.1 \pm 0.08, 4.4 \pm 0.04, 4.85 \pm 0.04, and 5 \pm 0.02 respectively. The \Gamma is agreeable with the former value determined by the ratio of upper critical field and higher than that of sample 1. Due

The inset presents the angular dependence of resistance for the Rb_{0.78}Fe_{1.62}Se_{2} single crystal (sample 1).

  to the slow cooling and longer time at high temperatures in the growth process, there are less impurities and defects with lower resistivity in the normal state and a higher residual resistivity ratio (R300K/R32K  14) in sample 2. Correspondingly, the semiconductor-to-metal-like transition hump in normal state shifts to 186 K, which coincides with the large Meissner screening volume and the sharper superconductivity transition. Compared with the anisotropy in other FeAs-based superconductors, the value of anisotropy is similar to 5 in NdFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and higher than 2-2.5 in Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}.

The anisotropy determined by the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory at different temperatures of Rb_{0.76}Fe_{1.62}Se_{2}, Rb_{0.80}Fe_{1.68}Se_{2}, Ba_{0.63}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2}, and Ba(Fe_{0.92}Co_{0.08})_{2}As_{2} single crystals are shown in Fig. 8. It is found that the anisotropy of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} decreases slightly with decreasing temperature. This kind of temperature dependence of \Gamma(T) is consistent with other FeAs-122 superconductors, such as Ba_{0.6}K_{0.44}Fe_{2}As_{2}, Ba(Fe_{0.92}Co_{0.08})_{2}As_{2}, etc. This may be understood as the multiband effect or the effect due to the gradual setting in of pair breaking by the spin-paramagnetic effect which requires H_{c2}^{ab}=H_{c2}^{c} in the low-temperature and high-field limit. It should be noted that the good scaling behavior suggests a field-independent anisotropy in the temperature and field range are investigated.[24] The anisotropy of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} is similar to that of the FeAs-1111 family, such as NdFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}, while it is higher than that in hole- and electron-doped FeAs-122 superconductors and KFe_{2}As_{2} with the same structure.[25] It is, however, very strange that KFe_{2}As_{2} and K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2}, should reside in the two terminals of the phase diagram; The former is strongly hole doped, while the latter is heavily electron doped. The larger anisotropy in K_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} may suggest a more two-dimensional Fermi surface in this material. The difference between the anisotropy in Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} and Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} may hinge on that the latter has a less warped Fermi surface. Meanwhile, the higher superconducting transition temperature with the better diamagnetism and the sharper superconducting transition is accompanied by the higher T_{an} which indicates the hump of resistivity is closely related to the superconductivity. Our results here should be stimulating in fulfilling a quantitative calculation and further studying on the electronic structure of this new family, and ultimately providing an understanding to the underlying mechanism of superconductivity.

## IV Conclusion

In conclusion, we successfully fabricated single crystals of Rb_{1-x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2} with the superconducting transition temperatures T_{c}\approx 31 - 32.5 K. A clear anomaly of the resistivity was observed in the normal state at about 150-186 K. We also determined the upper critical fields along the ab plane and c axis for two typical samples with different T_{an}, which yield an anisotropy of \Gamma\approx 3.5 when T_{an} = 150 K, while \Gamma\approx 4.8 when T_{an} = 186 K. It is found that the Meissner screening volume and the superconducting transition temperatures are higher for the sample with higher T_{an}. The angle-dependent resistivity measured below T_{c} allows a perfect scaling based on the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory. The consistent value

The inset presents the angular dependence of resistance for the Rb_{0.8}Fe_{1.68}Se_{2} single crystal (sample 2).

  of the anisotropy is acquired which decreases from about 3.6 at 30 K around T_{\rm c} to 2.9 at 27 K for sample 1 and from about 5 at 31 K around T_{\rm c} to 3.5 at 27 K. Comparing with the anisotropy determined for Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} and Ba(Fe_{0.92}Co_{0.08})_{2}As_{2} using the same method, we expect that the Fermi surfaces in the new system A_{x}Fe_{2}Se_{2} are less warped.
