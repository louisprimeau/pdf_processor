###### Abstract

A gradual increase of the hydrogen content in LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) (_x_ = 0-0.85) resulted in a continuous _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ enhancement behavior. _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ increased significantly from \(\sim\)26 K (_x_ = 0) to a value of \(\sim\)35.5 K (_x_ = 0.85). As the _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ was enhanced, structure analysis revealed a coupled gradual contraction of the lattice constants and a reduction of the As-Fe-As bond angle towards the ideal value of 109.5\({}^{\circ}\) of the regular tetrahedron. Since the Hall coefficient measurement detected no substantial change in the carrier number, optimization of structural parameters rather than carrier doping is likely to have played the leading role in the _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ enhancement, which could provide an important clue to the strong correlation between superconductivity and the structural parameters of iron-based superconductors. Some key phenomenological parameters, including the lower and the upper critical magnetic fields, critical current density, the density of states at the Fermi level of hydrogen-free and substituted samples, were also compared based on the magnetic and electrical characterizations, but no substantial changes were found to be associated with the hydrogen addition.

## 1 Introduction

Iron pnictides show superconductivity after suppression of their antiferromagnetic order, [1] through chemical substitution [2,3] or the application of pressure, [4,5] with a critical temperature (_T\({}_{\rm c}\)_) as high as 55 K, even rivaling doped cuprates. [6] A striking feature of iron superconductors is that their _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_'s show a strong dependence on specific materials. For example, the maximum _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ of the so-called 1111 _Ln_FeAsO (_Ln_ = rare earth) system changes with diverse _Ln_ without breaking structural symmetry, suggesting a crucial role of subtle variations in lattice parameters. More specifically, with the monotonic decrease of the lattice constant \(a\) for _Ln_ = La \(\rightarrow\) Sm, _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ gets a boost from \(\sim\)26 K to \(\sim\)55 K, [7,8] while a similar response was also observed in (La, Y)FeAsO\({}_{0.6}\) (\(\sim\)20 K \(\rightarrow\)\(\sim\)43.1 K) [9] and (La, Na)FeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)F\({}_{0.15}\) (\(\sim\)26 K \(\rightarrow\)\(\sim\)30.9 K) [10]; conversely, when \(a\) is almost saturated for _Ln_ = Nd \(\rightarrow\) Dy, _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ changes only negligibly. [7] In addition, a regular FeAs tetrahedron distortion with empirical value of As-Fe-As bond angle (\(\alpha\)) approaching 109.5\({}^{\circ}\) has also been found to favor a higher _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_. [11, 12, 13, 14] The application of pressure or isovalent substitution of P for As can also induce superconductivity, even without carrier doping. [4,5,15] These facts indicate that the crystal structure plays at least a role similar to carrier doping in establishing the superconducting state in iron pnictides. In the five-band model, parameters including both \(a\) and \(\alpha\) are thought to be closely related with the pnictogen height, which probably serves as the major factor affecting _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_, through controlling the multiband structure or determining the orbital fluctuations by adjusting the electron-phonon coupling strength. [16,17] The former conjecture was experimentally proved by a recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study on PrFeAsO\({}_{0.7}\). [18] It is notable that the spin-fluctuations have been perceived to play an important role for the superconductivity in iron pnictides, whereas the mechanism based on the electron-phonon coupling fails to explain the superconductivity since it is too weak in this system.

Very recently, the _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.60}\) (\(\sim\)28 K) was observed to be significantly enhanced even up to \(\sim\)35 K by incorporation of hydrogen atoms, for example LaFeAsO\({}_{0.60}\)H\({}_{0.60}\), [19] being reminiscent of the case in (La,Y)FeAsO\({}_{0.6}\) and (La,Na)FeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)F\({}_{0.15}\). [9,10] Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization indicated that hydrogen atoms in the H\({}^{-}\) form, intercalated at the interstitial sites between the La and Fe sites, play a role in optimizing the structural parameters, possibly accounting for the _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ enhancement. [20] However, hydrogen incorporation in SmFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)H\({}_{x}\) (_x_ \(\sim\) 0.2) induced only a comparable _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ of 55 K, with those of SmFeAs(O,F) or SmFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\). [21] Thus, an indirect doping effect with hydrogen ions supplying additional electrons into the FeAs layers seems reasonable: (O\({}^{2}\)\(\rightarrow\) H\({}^{-}\) + e\({}^{-1}\)) was proposed, as in the case of CeFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)H\({}_{x}\). [22] However, the comparable _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ of CeFeAsO\({}_{1-x}\)H\({}_{x}\) (_x_ = 0.25, 48 K) and CeFeAsO\({}_{0.65}\)H\({}_{0.65}\) (48 K) is much higher than the record created by fluorine doped CeFeAs(O,F) (41 K), [23] probably implying that the _T\({}_{\rm c}\)_ in hydrogen-doped compounds is enhanced. Reviewing earlier reports on moisture-induced superconductivity in SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) thin film (_T\({}_{\rm c}\)_\(\sim\) 25 K), FeTe\({}_{0.8}\)S\({}_{0.2}\) (_T\({}_{\rm c}\)_\(\sim\) 7.2 K), and NaFeAs (_T\({}_{\rm c}\)_\(\sim\) 25 K), [24, 25, 26] the resulting superconductivity was perceived to be produced by foreign atoms in a possible form of H\({}_{2}\)O, OH, H, or O molecules/ions accommodated at the interstitial sites; the debate between carrier doping and structural optimization has, however, continued. Recent density functional calculations have determined that the hydrogen atoms are  stably located close to the Fe atoms at the interstitial sites, while the Fermi level was also slightly shifted upward due to band filling with hydrogen doping.[27] Based on the available evidences, it is hard to judge the answer to this issue at present; thus, continuous efforts aimed at yielding in-depth insights are certainly desirable.

Here we report a study of \(T_{\rm c}\) enhancement in LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) (\(x\) = 0-0.85) with systematic hydrogen doping. The \(T_{\rm c}\) increased almost linearly with the increase in hydrogen content from \(\sim\)26 K for \(x\) = 0 to a final value of \(\sim\)35.5 K for \(x\) = 0.85. The continuous \(T_{\rm c}\) enhancement was strongly correlated with a gradual optimization of the lattice parameters upon the hydrogen incorporation, while neither the carrier number nor the superconducting parameters show any substantial change.

## II Experimental

The sample synthesis procedure of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) (\(x\) = 0.15, 0.35, 0.55, 0.70, and 0.85) in a flat-belt-type high-pressure apparatus was similar to those reported elsewhere.[28, 29] The starting materials were laboratory-made LaAs, Fe\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) (3N, Furuuchi Chem. Co.), La(OH)\({}_{3}\) (3N, Wako), As (5N, High Purity Chem.), and Fe powders (3N, 100 mesh, Rare Metallic Co.). Before use, La(OH)\({}_{3}\) was dried at 200 \({}^{\circ}\)C in flowing N\({}_{2}\) for 3 h. Each starting mixture was sealed in a golden capsule with an \(h\)-BN (hexagonal born nitride) tube inner and then heated on the high-pressure apparatus for 2 h at an elevated temperature of 1300 \({}^{\circ}\)C under a pressure of 6 GPa.

The phase purity of the product was examined by a powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) method in a Rigaku diffractometer (RINT2200V/PC) with Cu-K\(\alpha\) radiation (\(\lambda\) = 1.5418 A) in the 2\(\theta\) range from 5\({}^{\circ}\) to 100\({}^{\circ}\), with a step size of 2\({}^{\circ}\). The structure of the samples was further investigated by a synchrotron x-ray diffraction (SXRD) method, conducted at \(\lambda\) = 0.65298 A in a large Debye-Scherer camera installed on the BL15XU beam line of Spring-8.[30] The Rietveld analysis was carried out using the RIETAN-2000 program.[31]

Apart from hydrogen, the composition of La, Fe, and As in LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) was examined by the electron probe microanalysis (EPMA, JXA-8500F, JEOL) method, and the result is illustrated in Table 1. A reliable evaluation of the exact hydrogen amount was performed by thermogravimetry and mass spectroscopy (TG-MS) in a Bruker TG-DTA 2000SA/MS 9610 apparatus, employing a similar method to that in Ref. [21]. The LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) was slowly heated up to 800 \({}^{\circ}\)C in the protection of high-purity Ar, and the evaluated hydrogen content released from each sample is also listed in Table 1, normalized to the actual molar Fe content of each sample. It is clear that the evaluated values are rather close to those expected from the decomposition of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) (LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\)\(\rightarrow\) LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}+x/2\)H\({}_{2}\)\(\uparrow\)). It should be noted that the TG-MS result is the hydrogen content in the final product rather than that incorporated in the lattice of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\). The exact evaluation of hydrogen content was also accomplished with the aid of a phase purity check and EPMA analysis, which is helpful in excluding other possible hydrogen sources from impurities such as La(OH)\({}_{3}\). After the evaluation of the hydrogen content, the oxygen content was also estimated with employing the similar method as that described in Ref. [29].

The direct current (dc) magnetic susceptibility (\(\chi\)) was measured in a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) from Quantum Design, under both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) conditions in a 10 Oe magnetic field between 2 and 40 K. Isothermal magnetizations at various temperatures below the \(T_{\rm c}\) within the field range of \(\pm\)2 kOe were also measured using MPMS. Data on the dc electrical resistivity (\(\rho\)) were collected between 2 and 300 K with a constant gauge current of 0.2 mA in a physical properties measurement system (PPMS; Quantum Design). A four-probe method was used, with platinum wires attached to samples by silver paste. Specific heat capacity (\(C_{\rm p}(T)\)) measurement was performed between 2 and 300 K using the same apparatus, by adopting the typical relaxation-time method. The Hall coefficient measurement in PPMS was carried out in the temperature range 50-300 K.

## III Results and Discussion

First, the relation between \(T_{\rm c}\) and the nominal oxygen deficiency content \(\delta\) of the LaFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\) series was established. As shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) by the \(\rho(T)\) and the \(T_{\rm c}\) vs \(\delta\), superconductivity emerges in a relatively wide window of \(\delta\) = 0.08-0.28, with the \(T_{\rm c}\) running along a nearly dome-shaped trace with respect to \(\delta\). The dome is slightly asymmetric. Aside from the optimal point around \(\delta\) = 0.15, that is, in the "overdoped" regime, \(T_{\rm c}\) changes relatively slowly, since superconductivity still survives at \(1-\delta\) = 0.72. In the "underdoped" regime, it degenerates more rapidly, with \(T_{\rm c}\) being almost completely suppressed even at \(1-\delta\) = 0.92. The dome-shaped feature resembles those of other 1111- and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c c c c} Nominal \(x\) & La & Fe & As & O & \(g\)(O) & H & \(T_{\rm c}\) (K) & (Å) & \(c\) (Å) & \(V\) (Å) & \(\alpha\) (\({}^{\circ}\)) \\
0 & 1.00(2) & 1.00(0) & 1.00(3) & 0.86(2) & 0.848(5) & 0(0) & 26.4(4) & 4.032(7) & 8.713(7) & 141.39(9) & 11  122-type doped superconductors, such as TbFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\), NdFe\({}_{1-\delta}\)Co\({}_{x}\)AsO, and Ba(Fe,\(TM\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) (\(TM\) = transition metals).[32, 33, 34, 35] Provided that carrier doping is the simple source for the introduction of superconductivity, \(T_{\rm c}\) will be driven into the "overdoped" regime and hence will suffer a reduction when more carriers are added into the "optimal" LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\), as occurs in cuprate superconductors.

The room temperature XRD characterization on LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) (\(x\) = 0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.55, 0.70, and 0.85) indicates that all specimens studied herein hold the same crystal symmetry, adopting a tetragonal unit cell (space group: \(P4/mmm\)) with a ZrCuSiAs-type structure.[36] The structural details will be discussed later. To document the effect of H addition on the \(T_{\rm c}\) of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\), \(\chi(T)\) and \(\rho(T)\) of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) are shown in Figs. 2(a)-2(f) and 2(g)-2(l), respectively. For hydrogen-free LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\), a sharp drop of \(\chi\) at \(T_{\rm c}\sim\) 25 K (derived from \(d\chi/dT\)) is visible, corresponding to the onset temperature of diamagnetism; this is comparable with previous reports.[29] The diamagnetic shielding fraction at 2 K was estimated to be 0.94, based on the calculated density of 6.667 g/cm\({}^{3}\), provided that the perfect diamagnetism is 1.00, thus ensuring bulk superconductivity. Once an appropriate amount of hydrogen is introduced when the oxygen content is fixed at \(1-\delta\) = 0.85, the effect is immediately manifested by the progressively raised \(T_{\rm c}\), which increases almost linearly as hydrogen addition progresses, from 25 K at \(x\) = 0 finally to 35 K at \(x\) = 0.85, as indicated by the \(T_{\rm c}\) of \(\chi\). The magnitude of the increase (10 K) is slightly larger than that reported for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.60}\) in Ref. [19] (28 K \(\rightarrow\) 35 K). Our results not only confirm that \(T_{\rm c}\) can be enhanced but also reveal that it can be continuously increased with the gradual incorporation of the hydrogen content. The same result can also be observed from the \(\rho(T)\) shown in Figs. 2(g)-2(l). From the enlarged part between 2 and 40 K inserted in each figure, it is clear that even the magnitude of the \(T_{\rm c}\) enhancement is comparable with that derived from \(\chi(T)\), despite the slightly larger \(T_{\rm c}\) of \(\rho(T)\) for \(x\) = 0.85, 35.5 K, suggesting that the result is highly reproducible. Moreover, in the normal state, neither the magnitude nor the characteristics of \(\rho(T)\) change remarkably. Taking the \(T_{\rm c}-\delta\) phase diagram of LaFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\) into account, the role of hydrogen addition as carrier doping probably cannot account for the \(T_{\rm c}\) enhancement of "optimal" LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\), differing significantly from what it does during the establishment of the superconducting states in SmFeAsO,[21] undoped SrFe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) film,[24] and other analogous cases.

To further guarantee the bulk superconductivity, as well as to probe the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level (\(E_{\rm F}\)), the specific heat of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) was presented. The low temperature parts in the form of \(C_{\rm p}(T)/T\) vs \(T\) for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) between 2 and 40 K are summarized in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) as examples, with the expected thermodynamic anomalies that signaled the superconducting transitions being visible at 25 K and 35.5 K, suggesting that the polycrystals are in inhomogeneous superconducting state. The lattice contribution was accurately extracted by a method similar to that in Ref. [37], using LaFe\({}_{0.9}\)Mn\({}_{0.1}\)AsO\({}_{0.85}\) as the initial compound. Here, the superconductivity is sufficiently suppressed without resulting in other magnetic anomalies--including the Schottky anomaly--in any magnetic field; thus it will not harm the extraction. The \(C_{\rm p}\) for LaFe\({}_{0.9}\)Mn\({}_{0.1}\)AsO\({}_{0.85}\) is shown in Fig. 3(c), and its presentation in the \(C_{\rm p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) form as an inset is indeed magnetic field independent. The fit to low-temperature data yielded the electronic contribution term \(\gamma_{\rm g}^{\rm Mn}\) as 1.68(3) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\). The lattice contribution of LaFe\({}_{0.9}\)Mn\({}_{0.1}\)AsO\({}_{0.85}\), \(C_{\rm latt}^{\rm Mn}\), was consequently obtained by subtracting \(\gamma_{\rm g}^{\rm Mn}T\) from the total \(C_{\rm p}\). Due to the slight differences of the lattice parameters between LaFe\({}_{0.9}\)Mn\({}_{0.1}\)AsO\({}_{0.85}\) and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\), we thus can assume that the phonon contribution to the \(C_{\rm p}(T)\) and to entropy obey the law of corresponding states, hence the normal-state of \(C_{\rm p}\) of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) can be obtained from the corresponding states approximation with the formula[37, 38]

\[C_{\rm tot}(T)=C_{\rm latt}(T)+\gamma_{\rm g}\,T=AC_{\rm latt}^{\rm Mn}(BT)+ \gamma_{\rm g}\,T,\] (1)

where \(\gamma_{\rm g}\) is the Sommerfeld constant of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) in the normal state, and \(A\) and \(B\) are plotted constants (listed in Table 2). The difference between the measured \(C_{\rm p}(T)/T\) and the normal-state counterpart \(C_{\rm latt}(T)/T\), \(\Delta C_{\rm el}(T)/T\), was inserted in each corresponding figure, revealing clear jumps at \(T_{\rm c}\) = 25.1(2) K and 35.5(5) K (corresponding to the \(T_{\rm c}\) of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\), respectively), thus providing compelling evidence for bulk superconductivity. The close values of \(\gamma_{\rm g}\) for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\), 1.65 and 1.71 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), both agree well to those values for LaFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\), Co- and F-doped LaFeAsO.[29, 30, 40] The estimation of the electronic DOS at the Fermi level (\(N(E_{\rm F})\)

The main panel of (c) shows the specific heat for LaFe\({}_{0.9}\)Mn\({}_{0.1}\)AsO\({}_{0.85}\), and the low temperature part in the form \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) shows field independence and no other anomalies.

(g)–(l) The resistivity \(\rho\)(T) (2–300 K) for each sample and the corresponding insets enlarge the low temperature part between 2–40 K.

  with the aid of \(\gamma_{n}\) gave values around 1 states/eV per unit cell for the LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) series from the relation \(\gamma_{n}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}k_{B}^{2}N(E_{F})(1+\lambda_{ep})\) by assuming \(\lambda_{ep}=0\), since the electron-phonon coupling is very weak.[41] By idealizing the \(C_{\rm{p}}(T)\) anomaly under the constraint of entropy balance between the superconducting and normal state as \(\int_{0}^{T_{c}}{(c_{\rm{c}}(T))dT}=\gamma_{n}T_{c}\), the accurate determination of \(T_{\rm{c}}(C_{\rm{p}})\) was accomplished (in Table 2). Throughout the listed values in Table 2, \(N(E_{\rm{F}})\) actually changes negligibly over the hydrogen concentrations, while \(T_{c}(C_{\rm{p}})\) changes in a comparable way to those identified by both \(\chi(T)\) and \(\rho(T)\), making it probable that hydrogen addition plays a minor role in providing carriers into LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\). Further evidence was obtained by the evaluation of the carrier density shown in Fig. 3(d), calculated from the measured Hall coefficient. The profiles of all studied specimens are very similar, indicating little change of the electron number over the hydrogen addition. The carrier density at 300 K for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) was 3.92(3) x 1021 cm-3-4.29(2) x 1021 cm-3 (shown in Table 2), corresponding to about 1.1 electrons per primitive cell, being also comparable with the values reported for F-doped LaFeAsO.[42] Even with further cooling, the difference in carrier density among independent samples was actually very small.

The \(\rho(T)\) for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) in various magnetic fields \(H\) is depicted in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. \(H\) markedly pushes the zero-resistance temperature \(T_{\rm{c0}}\) from 21.3 K at \(H\) = 0 T to 14.5 K at \(H\) = 9 T of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\). The criteria of a 10%, 50%, and 90% drop of \(\rho(T)\) across the superconducting transition were adopted for the evaluations, which are shown as insets in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The initial slopes yielded in the vicinity of \(T_{c}\), \(\delta H_{\rm{c2}}/\partial T\), are about \(-\)0.387 T/K, \(-\)0.25 T/K, and \(-\)0.245 T/K, respectively. Since the 90% criterion is generally harmed by the vortex-liquid phase, while the 10% criterion tends to be disturbed by the superconducting fluctuations,[43, 44, 45, 46] the ground state value \(H_{\rm{c2}}(0)\) is about 35.0(4) T, fitting the 50% criterion to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) relation (shown by the solid line) \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm{c2}}(T)=-0.693\mu_{0}(dH_{\rm{c2}}/dT)_{T=T,T_{\rm{c}}}\) and neglecting the effect from spin paramagnetism (\(\alpha\) = 0) and spin-orbit scattering (\(\lambda_{\rm{SO}}\) = 0).[47] The value is smaller than those of NdFeIn\({}_{1-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\)AsO (102 T)[48] and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.89}\)F\({}_{0.11}\) (45 T).[49] For LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\), \(H\) sharply reduces the \(T_{\rm{c0}}\) from 29.6 K at \(H\) = 0 T to \(T_{\rm{c0}}\) = 15.6 K at 9 T, thus giving rise to \(\delta H_{\rm{c2}}/\partial T\approx-0.22\) T/K and \(H_{\rm{c2}}(0)\) = 32.7(1) T, using the 50% criterion. The slight difference between the \(H_{\rm{c2}}(0)\) of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) indicates a moderate effect from hydrogen addition. Provided the evaluation is close to the truth, the \(H_{\rm{c2}}(0)\) values of both samples are smaller than the weak-coupling estimation of the BCS paramagnetic critical field, \(\mu_{0}H_{\rm{P}}\) = 1.84\(T_{\rm{c}}\sim\) 44 T, possibly suggesting the orbital effect plays the dominant role. Assuming that \(H_{\rm{c2}}\) is purely orbital, the coherence length \(\xi_{\rm{GL}}\) at \(T\) = 0 can be estimated from the single-band Ginzburg-Landau relation \(\xi_{\rm{GL}}=\sqrt{\phi_{0}/2\pi}\,H_{\rm{c2}}(0)\), where \(\phi_{0}\) is the flux quantum, giving \(\xi_{\rm{GL}}(0)\) = 30.6(6) A for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and 31.7(4) A for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\), respectively, suggesting little change with the hydrogen substitution.

In addition to gradually raising the \(T_{\rm{c}}\), the hydrogen addition also enhances the Meissner fractions in the \(\chi(T)\) curves. This can be clearly seen by the FC curves in Figs. 2(a)-2(f) of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\), in which the absolute

The inset in each figure presents the upper critical field \(H_{\rm{c2}}\) found from 90%, 50%, and 10% of the superconducting drop.

  values of the magnetic moments except in the vicinity of \(T_{\rm c}\) apparently increase. The Meissner fraction of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) is fairly small, less than 0.1, as was estimated by using the FC data at 2 K. Such contrasting features between the magnetic shielding and the Meissner fractions have been commonly observed in oxygen-deficient 1111 systems [52] and are probably due to efficient magnetic-flux pins and a small particle size that is not far from the magnetic penetration depth (\(\sim\)0.25 \(\mu\)m [50]). In LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) the Meissner fraction increases significantly, even up to \(\sim\)0.4 (FC, 5 K). This behavior would be interesting to study further. Meanwhile, the magnetization isotherms of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\), presented as insets in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), exhibit typical behavior of a type-II superconductor. The \(M(H)\) profiles of the two samples are different even at a first glance. The lower critical field (\(H_{\rm c1}\)) at which the magnetization deviates from a linear response is identified. A least-squares fit to the data using \(H_{\rm c1}(T)=H_{\rm c1}(0)(1-t^{2})\) (the \(t=T/T_{\rm c}\)) yielded the ground state values of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) as \(H_{\rm c1}(0)=6.28(6)\times 10^{-3}\) T and \(5.87(7)\times 10^{-3}\) T, respectively [Fig. 5(c)]. [51] The \(H_{\rm c1}(0)\) leads to a London penetration depth \(\lambda(0)\) of \(3.18\times 10^{3}\) A for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and \(3.22\times 10^{3}\) A for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\), respectively, through the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer formula \(H_{\rm c1}(T)=(\phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda^{2})\ln(\lambda/5_{\rm GL})\). We also estimated \(J_{\rm c}\) by applying the Bean model with the formula \(J_{\rm c}=20\Delta M/Va(1-2a/3b)\), [52] where \(\Delta M\) is the width of the \(M\)-\(H\) loop, and \(V\), \(a\), and \(b\) are the volume, width, and length of the polycrystal, respectively. The estimated \(J_{\rm c}\) at 2 K of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) is about 5200 A/cm\({}^{2}\), being far lower than those reported for the 122-system, suggesting a prominent grain boundary effect where the grains are somewhat weakly linked as compared to single crystals. [53, 54] Exceptionally, hydrogen addition does not substantially enhance \(J_{\rm c}\) despite the \(T_{\rm c}\) being slightly raised: 4500 A/cm\({}^{2}\) for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) at 2 K.

The relation between \(T_{\rm c}\) and lattice parameters of the LaFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\) series resembles those previously established, for example, for TbFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\). [32] Lattice constants of \(a\), \(b\), and the unit-cell volume (\(V\)) of LaFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\) are illustrated in Figs. 6(a)-6(c). The parameters show a similar evolution trend, reaching the minimal value, while \(T_{\rm c}\) is optimized at \(\delta=0.15\) and then rising again with the increase of \(\delta\) into the "overdoped" regime. The tight correlation between \(T_{\rm c}\) (by \(\rho\)) and lattice constant \(a\) is shown in Fig. 6(d), revealing that a higher \(T_{\rm c}\) appears at a smaller \(a\). However, the refined As-Fe-As bond angle, even at \(\delta=0.15\), is as large as 113.09(9)\({}^{\circ}\), indicating that the local distortion of the FeAs\({}_{4}\) tetrahedron deviates significantly from a regular state with the empirical value of 109.5\({}^{\circ}\), as illustrated by Fig. 6(e); hence, the \(T_{\rm c}\) of 26 K is much lower than the record of \(\sim\)55 K for an Sm-based 1111 superconductor with As-Fe-As bond angle 109.76\({}^{\circ}\) and \(a\) constant 3.90236(8) A. [55] The \(T_{\rm c}\) value is also slightly lower than that of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.60}\) synthesized under a pressure of 3 GPa (\(\sim\)28 K), whose structure parameters are slightly improved. [7] This fact implies that a further optimization of the crystal structure of the LaFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\) can yield a higher \(T_{\rm c}\), as in the case of hydrogen doping.

The Rietveld analysis result of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) was already presented in Ref. [29]. Figure 6(f) shows the observed, calculated, and difference profiles of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) as an example. The SXRD pattern can be satisfactorily reproduced by the ZrCuSiAs-type structure model with the lattice parameters \(a=0.400166(10)\) A and \(c=0.86858(2)\) A. The reliability indices (\(R_{\rm up}=3.185\%\), \(R_{\rm p}=2.166\%\), and \(R_{\rm F}=0.362\%\)) are sufficiently low, indicating the high quality of the fit, as does a comparison between the refined and the experimental patterns. The structure solutions are listed in Table III compared with those of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\). The analysis revealed 0.72 mass% of La(OH)\({}_{3}\), 0.43 mass% of LaAs, 1 mass% of La\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), and 1.34 mass% of Fe. The tiny amount of La(OH)\({}_{3}\) indicates that the exact content of hydrogen in LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) is close to the nominal value. Several main peaks (102), (110), and (111) of the powder XRD patterns of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{x}\) are inserted in Fig. 6(f) as examples to show the evolution trend upon hydrogen doping, which exhibits a systematic shift with the increase of hydrogen content. The change is clearly shown by the lattice parameters summarized in Table 1, including \(a\), \(c\), \(V\), and As-Fe-As, which show a monotonic decrease with the increase of hydrogen level, suggesting that hydrogen addition slightly compresses the unit cell; the changes of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\) from those of the host LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) are approximately 0.746% for \(a\), 0.32% for \(c\), 1.585% for \(V\), and 1.37% for As-Fe-As. The results also imply the successful

The insets in each figure show the \(M(H)\) loops up to 0.2 T. The solid line is drawn to show the linear part of the data measured at 2 K. (c) The temperature dependence of \(H_{\rm c1}(T)\); the dotted lines are fit to the data with the formula \(H_{\rm c1}(T)=H_{\rm c1}(0)(1-t^{2})\), where \(t\) is defined as \(t=T/T_{\rm c}\).

  incorporation of hydrogen to at least above \(x=0.70\) without touching the solubility limit. The continuous decrease of lattice parameters with the hydrogen addition resembles the case of applying pressure,[56] which more markedly reduces the lattice parameters approximately 4.3% for \(a\), 9.86% for \(c\), and 17.4% for \(V\) when the applied pressure reaches 32.26 GPa. Because the x-ray atomic scattering factor of hydrogen is too small, it is hard to refine either its site position or the occupancy. During the Rietveld analysis, the values of the temperature factors, \(U_{\rm iso}\), for La, Fe, As, and O were initially fixed as those in the undoped sample, then the occupancy factor of O was also refined.

Regarding the contraction of the lattice constants, three possibilities have been proposed.[19],[20],[22] The first is that the incorporated hydrogen is in a H\({}^{+}\) form located at the interstitial site between La and Fe sites, thus attracting the neighboring O\({}^{2-}\) and/or As\({}^{3-}\) ions.[18] The second is that hydrogen is in an H\({}^{-}\) (1.275 A) form at the O\({}^{2-}\) (1.42 A) site,[20], which then results in electron doping in the FeAs layer, thus attracting two layers much closer; this is possibly supported by the fact of the reduced Fe-Fe distance from 2.8514(1) A of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) to 2.8294(1) A of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\). The final possibility is that the O\({}^{2-}\) ions are replaced by the (OH)\({}^{-}\) ions, and the slight difference between their ionic size (1.40 A for O\({}^{2-}\) and 1.37 A for (OH)\({}^{-}\)) leads to the contraction of the unit cell.[20] However, taking the domelike relation between \(T_{\rm c}\) and \(\delta\) into account, overcharge doping in the optimal LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) superconductor will decrease the \(T_{\rm c}\), which is not consistent with our observations.

A natural question is why the effects on LaFeAsO\({}_{1-\delta}\), CeFeAsO and SmFeAsO associated with hydrogen doping are so different? The \(T_{\rm c}\) of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\), LaFeAsO\({}_{0.60}\), and CeFeAsO increases beyond the records created by carrier doping either by oxygen deficiency or fluorine doping, whereas the \(T_{\rm c}\) produced in SmFeAs(O,H) is only comparable with that of a doped sample of 55 K.[21] In fact, the effort by hydrogen doping also failed to raise the \(T_{\rm c}\) in SmFeAsO\({}_{0.60}\)H\({}_{0.60}\).[57] One fact that must be taken into account is that the structure of the Sm-1111

Selected bond lengths (\(d\)) and angles are \(d_{\rm Fe-As}=2.4168(6)\) Å (\(\times 4\)), \(d_{\rm La-O}=2.3741(3)\) Å (\(\times 4\)), \(\alpha_{\rm As-Fe-As}=113.1(4)\)°, \(72.34(5)\)° for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\); and \(d_{\rm Fe-As}=2.4206(4)\) Å (\(\times 4\)), \(d_{\rm La-O}=2.3902(3)\) Å (\(\times 4\)), \(\alpha_{\rm As-Fe-As}=111.58(9)\)°, \(71.66(9)\)° for LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{0.85}\).

  system is almost optimized; it is rather difficult to improve it further through hydrogen doping. In contrast, the parameters of La-1111 and Ce-1111 systems are far from being optimized; thus, hydrogen doping can precisely play that role. On the other hand, taking into account the relation between \(T_{\rm c}\) and the lattice constant \(a\) of some 1111 superconductors, as presented in Fig. 7, the values of \(a\) of the hydrogen-doped LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{\rm{z}}\), well as other key parameters such as As-Fe-As bond angle, are located between Ce-1111 (\(T_{\rm c}\) = 38.5 K, \(a\) = 0.3995 nm)[7] and LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\); hence their \(T_{\rm c}\) are just between them. For all the lattice parameters listed in Table 3, the evolution tendency of the FeAs\({}_{4}\) tetrahedron of LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\)H\({}_{\rm{z}}\) with the increase of hydrogen incorporation is apparently toward an ideal distortion state, indicative of clear structural optimization behavior.

In summary, the hydrogen addition in LaFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) was realized under high-pressure conditions, which remarkably raises the critical temperature \(T_{\rm c}\) from 26 K gradually up to \(\sim\)35.5 K. The nearly linearly increase of \(T_{\rm c}\) with the hydrogen content was found to be associated with a gradual optimization of lattice parameters, without substantially changing the carrier concentrations, probably suggesting that optimization of structural parameters rather than carrier doping is the major reason. It is clearly consistent with the opinion in Ref. [16] for interpreting the \(T_{\rm c}\) enhancement in LaFeAsO\({}_{0.60}\)H\({}_{0.60}\) rather than a carrier doping effect proposed in Refs. [21] and [22] for both SmFeAs(O,H) and CeFeAs(O,H).[21, 22] Since there is a debate between carrier doping and structure tuning as the source for superconductivity in iron pnictides, it has been difficultl to establish a solid picture as was done for cuprate superconductors. The results reported herein provide helpful supporting data and clues to the study. It could also be interesting to study how the magnetic excitations/fluctuations with hydrogen-addition in such 1111 families evolve, since the substitution seems to be involved in the superconductivity mechanism. Moreover, the results could indicate an effective direction in the search for new superconductors with a high \(T_{\rm c}\) by focusing on structural design.
