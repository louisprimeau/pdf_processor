## III Results and discussions

Fig. 1(a) shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of the samples with the nominal composition (Ca1+xNa2)Fe2As2 for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.36, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.66, respectively. Each peak is labeled with the corresponding crystal face index (hkl), which indicates the single-phase nature. The x-ray diffraction patterns with a wide 2_th_ range (10 to 135) were collected for the structure refinements, and the least-squares method was used to determine the lattice parameters of all polycrystalline samples. Figs. 1(b)-1(d) show the detailed structures of CaFe2As2, (Ca0.64Na0.36)Fe2As2, and (Ca0.5Na0.5)Fe2As2, respectively, obtained using the Rietveld refinement method. The results indicate a ThCr2Si2 structure with space group _I4/mmm_ and a tetragonal lattice. Table 1 lists the crystallographic data of (Ca1+xNa2)Fe2As2 for x = 0, 0.36, 0.5, and 0.66, [19] and (Ba1+xKx)Fe2As2 for x = 0,0.4. [6]

Given the nature of hole doping and the larger ionic radius of Na+1 (1.18 A) than that of Ca+2 (1.12 A), [21, 36] the _a_-axis shrunk and the _c_-axis expanded, in relation to the parent compound CaFe2As2. Moreover, the lattice parameters and volume monotonically changed with increasing the Na doping level, as shown in Fig. 2. Some samples were analyzed using the energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer analysis, and the results agree with that of the nominal x. For (Ca0.34Na0.66)Fe2As2, the atomic ratio of Na/(Na + Ca) is 0.66(3). This result is confirmed by the linear dependence of the lattice parameter on the nominal x following Vegard's law.

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility curves of (Ca1+xNa2)Fe2As2 for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 with a magnetic field of H = 5 T. The SDW anomaly of the CaFe2As2 single crystal appeared at 165 K in the H//ab plane. As the temperature decreased, the magnetic susceptibility of the polycrystal slowly reduced until a certain temperature. Below this temperature, the susceptibility showed a Curie-Weiss-like behavior, increasing rapidly with

  temperature decrease. The susceptibility transformation was attributed to the occurrence of tetragonal-to-orthorhombic and SDW transitions with Ts = 150, 135, and 120 K for x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. As a result, the Na doping at the Ca site monotonously suppressed the SDW and finally induced superconductivity over a certain doping region. The suppression is very similar to the behavior observed in the (Ba_{1.\rm x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system.[15] Furthermore, a structural and magnetic transition split was observed in the Ba(Fe_{1.\rm x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystals.[37, 38] In the d(R(T)/R(200 K))/dT versus T plot of (Ca_{0.9}Na_{0.1})Fe_{2}As_{2} in Fig. 3(b), a bulge can be observed around 150 K, which is consistent with the magnetic transition temperature. However, we cannot determine the structural and magnetic transition split in the polycrystalline samples. Further studies involving neutrons, low-temperature x-ray diffraction, and single crystals are required to investigate the transition split in (Ca_{1.\rm x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2}.

In Fig. 3(c), the susceptibility transformations attributed to the SDWs in (Ca_{0.68}Na_{0.32})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{0.67}Na_{0.33})Fe_{2}As_{2} can be observed at 65 and 50 K below 5 T. With a zero-field cooling (ZFC) signal at 30 Oe, the superconductivities can be observed at 14 and 15 K, respectively. Given the SDW transitions and the superconductivities in (Ca_{0.68}Na_{0.32})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{0.67}Na_{0.33})Fe_{2}As_{2}, SDW and superconductivity may therefore coexist in (Ca_{1.\rm x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} in the region of 0.3 <x< 0.36. The (Ba_{1.\rm x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system [15] exhibits a similar phenomenon in the region of 0.2 <x< 0.4. Moreover, the SDW anomaly in the (Ba_{1.\rm x},K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system occurs at about 140 K and is fully suppressed for x\approx 0.4.[15] The SDW temperatures of (Ca_{1.\rm x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ba_{1.\rm x},K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} are different, but they entirely disappear for x\approx 0.36 and 0.4, respectively. This phenomenon is attributed to the Fermi surface structure of 122-type parent compounds. The hole pockets at the \Gamma point and the same-size electron pockets at the M point in the Brillouin zone cause the SDW-type instability via strong interband nesting effects.[28, 34] In Na or K doping, the hole pockets expand, whereas the electron pockets shrink, resulting in a mismatch between the two kinds of pockets and the destruction of the interband nesting. Therefore, carrier density, as well as the Fermi surface size mismatch, plays a crucial role in suppressing the SDW anomaly in the two systems. In addition, phase separation is one possible cause of the SDW and superconductivity coexistence in a macroscopic scale. This possibility cannot be excluded based on the current experiment. In Ref. [15], for (Ba_{1.\rm x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2}, the phase separation is excluded from the high-resolution synchrotron x-ray experiment with \lambda = 0.1067 A because there is no peak split. However, in Ref. [39], a mesoscopic phase separation is observed using a Magnetic Force Microscope and muon spin rotation (\muSR). Further investigation is needed to confirm the occurrence of phase separation in (Ca_{1.\rm x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} using microscopic analysis.

In Fig. 3(d), both ZFC and field cooling (FC) signals at 30 Oe indicate a superconductivity transition at 17, 19, 22, 33, and 34 K for x = 0.36, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.66, respectively. Large superconducting volume fractions can be estimated from the FC signals, particularly for (Ca_{0.4}Na_{0.6})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{0.34}Na_{0.66})Fe_{2}As_{2}, with a 35% superconducting volume fraction, which indicates the bulk superconducting nature of the samples. Moreover, the magnetic susceptibility evolutions for the x = 0.36 and x = 0.66 samples are different. For the x = 0.36 sample, the susceptibility monotonically decreases after the superconductivity transition. This result is the same as that of the authors of Ref. [36], who observed the superconductivity in (Ca,Na)Fe_{2}As_{2} with low Na doping. Their M(T) curves were also broad. This observation seems common for Ca122 with low Na doping partly because the inhomogeneity at low Na doping induces a broad transition.

The electronic transport measurement in Fig. 4(a) also indicates a transition at the superconducting temperature for the three distinct superconducting phases corresponding to x = 0.36, 0.5, and 0.66. This transition can be determined from the onset of the magnetic and resistivity curve transitions, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). The samples display a behavior similar to that of a metal at normal states with the ratios of residual resistance (RRRs) at 10, 18, and 30, respectively. Here, RRR = R_{300\rm K}/R_{0}, where R_{300\rm K} is

  the resistivity at 300 K, and R_{0} is the residual resistivity presumably extracted from T=0 K. Fig. 4(b) shows the effects of the magnetic field on the superconductivity transition for x=0.66 phases. The upper critical field H_{\rm c2} is determined using the middle point of the superconductivity transition. The slope of the curve at dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{\rm T=T_{c}} is -4.49 T/K. Taking 34 K as T_{\rm c}, based on the Werthdamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula[22] of H_{\rm c2}(0) = -0.693(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)T_{\rm c}, the upper critical fields are calculated as 106 T for the x=0.66 phases. The upper critical fields of the x=0.66 polycrystal are comparable with those of the x=0.66 single crystal,[19] indicating dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{\rm T=T_{c}} slopes of -3.73 and -7.53 T/K for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm c}(0) and H_{\rm c2}^{\rm ab}(0) and, consequently, 85 and 172 T for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm c}(0) and H_{\rm c2}^{\rm ab}(0), respectively.

The specific-heat capacities of the polycrystalline samples with x=0.36, 0.5, and 0.66, respectively, are measured to further investigate the superconducting properties of the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system. In the normal state, the specific heat of a sample includes the electron C_{\rm el} and phone C_{\rm ph} contributions. At low temperatures, C_{\rm el}=\gamma_T_ and C_{\rm ph}=\beta_T_[3]. A second term of the harmonic-lattice approximation is used to improve the reliability at higher temperatures. Hence, Cn can be expressed as follows:

\[Cn=C_{\rm el}+C_{\rm ph}=\gamma\,T+\beta T^{3}+\eta T^{5}.\]

The data are fitted with Cn in a narrow region above Tc to determine the parameters. Then, \Delta C(C-Cn)/T is plotted versus Tc. In Fig. 5(a), no obvious jump is observed for C(T) between the 0 and 5 T magnetic fields, but a curvature change exists in the \Delta C/T curve of the x=0.36 sample around the transition temperature. This curvature change is attributed to the low superfluid density[23] and is similar to that of LaO_{1.x}F_{x}FeAs[24, 25] with Tc=26 K. A heat-capacity difference between the C(T) curve in the 0- to 5-T magnetic field, and the peak of the \Delta C/T curve around 22 K is observed for the x=0.5 sample in Fig. 5(b). Its maximum value is \Delta C/T\approx 20 mJ/(mol K^{2}). As seen in (Ba_{0.5}K_{0.5})Fe_{2}As_{2},[23]

(lower inset) Magnetic susceptibilities [\chi(T)] of the (Ca_{0.68}Na_{0.32})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{0.67}Na_{0.33})Fe_{2}As_{2} measured in a magnetic field H=30 Oe with both ZFC and FC modes. (d) Magnetic susceptibilities [\chi(T)] of the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} for x=0.36, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.66 measured in a magnetic field H=30 Oe with both ZFC and FC modes.

  Fig. 5(c) shows a clear jump at 34 K for the x=0.66 sample. The jump is relatively sharp, and the value at its maximum is \Delta C/T\approx 66 mJ/(mol K^{2}).

A two-thirds Na doping at the Ca site is the limit to obtain a single phase in the current experiment. The nominal carrier densities for (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} with x=0.36, 0.5, and 0.66 are 0.18/Fe, 0.25/Fe, and 0.33/Fe, respectively. Compared with the samples with x=0.36 and 0.5, the sample with x=0.66 shows a higher Tc and a sharper superconductivity transition.

However, this case is not similar to that of the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system, where an optimal doping level of x=0.4 with Tc=38 K exists and the transition temperature decreases with higher doping levels. In Table 1, as the Na doping increases from x=0 to x=0.66, As-Fe-As (\alpha) decreases from 110.19 to 107.766 and As-Fe-As (\beta) increases from 109.11 to 110.331. The evolution of the FeAs tetrahedron in (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} has the same trend as that of the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system.[32] Meanwhile, the anion height of

  the Fe plane changes from 1.357 A of CaFe_{2}As_{2} to 1.401 A of (Ca_{0.34}Na_{0.66})Fe_{2}As_{2}. This change is consistent with the value change from 1.359 A of BaFe_{2}As_{2} to 1.379 A of (Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4})Fe_{2}As_{2}. In (Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4})Fe_{2}As_{2}, the FeAs tetrahedron is almost regular and the anion height is 1.38 A, which is recommended in Ref. [29] as the ideal empirical distance for high _Tc_. These results explain the x = 0.4 optimal doping level in the (Ba_{1-x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system.

These differences may be caused by the structure details of the two compounds, that is, Ca 122 is more sensitive to pressure [26, 27] or doping change. In fact, the superconductivity of Fe-based superconductors is very dependent on doping. [33] Furthermore, pressure and chemical doping have similar effects on the structure distortions of BaFe_{2}As_{2} superconductors, [32] implying that a higher _Tc_ could be stabilized under pressure in (Ca_{0.34}Na_{0.66})Fe_{2}As_{2}.

The temperature-composition phase diagrams of the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system in a wide Na doping range can be summarized and constructed based on the structural, magnetic, electronic transport, and heat-capacity measurements reported earlier. The structural and SDW transitions are suppressed almost linearly in the Na-doped samples in x<0.3 until x\approx 0.36, where no SDW transition occurs. For 0.3<x<0.36, SDW and superconductivity coexist in the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system, as also observed in the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} and SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}[30] systems. However, superconductivity for 0.3<x<0.66 and higher _Tc_ with higher Na doping are observed, which are different from those in the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system.

## IV Conclusion

Single-crystalline CaFe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} polycrystals (0<x<0.66) were grown and characterized using structural, magnetic, electronic transport, and heat-capacity measurements. As the Na doping was increased, the SDW transition was continuously suppressed and superconductivity was observed over a certain region. Hence, SDW and superconductivity may coexist in (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} in the 0.3<x<0.36 region. A temperature-composition phase diagram of the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system was summarized, constructed, and compared with that of the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system. The carrier density and the size mismatch of the Fermi surfaces were found to be crucial factors in suppressing the SDW anomaly in Fe-based 122 systems.

## III Results and discussions

Fig. 1(a) shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of the samples with the nominal composition (Ca1+xNa2)Fe2As2 for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.36, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.66, respectively. Each peak is labeled with the corresponding crystal face index (hkl), which indicates the single-phase nature. The x-ray diffraction patterns with a wide 2_th_ range (10 to 135) were collected for the structure refinements, and the least-squares method was used to determine the lattice parameters of all polycrystalline samples. Figs. 1(b)-1(d) show the detailed structures of CaFe2As2, (Ca0.64Na0.36)Fe2As2, and (Ca0.5Na0.5)Fe2As2, respectively, obtained using the Rietveld refinement method. The results indicate a ThCr2Si2 structure with space group _I4/mmm_ and a tetragonal lattice. Table 1 lists the crystallographic data of (Ca1+xNa2)Fe2As2 for x = 0, 0.36, 0.5, and 0.66, [19] and (Ba1+xKx)Fe2As2 for x = 0,0.4. [6]

Given the nature of hole doping and the larger ionic radius of Na+1 (1.18 A) than that of Ca+2 (1.12 A), [21, 36] the _a_-axis shrunk and the _c_-axis expanded, in relation to the parent compound CaFe2As2. Moreover, the lattice parameters and volume monotonically changed with increasing the Na doping level, as shown in Fig. 2. Some samples were analyzed using the energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer analysis, and the results agree with that of the nominal x. For (Ca0.34Na0.66)Fe2As2, the atomic ratio of Na/(Na + Ca) is 0.66(3). This result is confirmed by the linear dependence of the lattice parameter on the nominal x following Vegard's law.

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility curves of (Ca1+xNa2)Fe2As2 for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 with a magnetic field of H = 5 T. The SDW anomaly of the CaFe2As2 single crystal appeared at 165 K in the H//ab plane. As the temperature decreased, the magnetic susceptibility of the polycrystal slowly reduced until a certain temperature. Below this temperature, the susceptibility showed a Curie-Weiss-like behavior, increasing rapidly with

  temperature decrease. The susceptibility transformation was attributed to the occurrence of tetragonal-to-orthorhombic and SDW transitions with Ts = 150, 135, and 120 K for x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. As a result, the Na doping at the Ca site monotonously suppressed the SDW and finally induced superconductivity over a certain doping region. The suppression is very similar to the behavior observed in the (Ba_{1.\rm x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system.[15] Furthermore, a structural and magnetic transition split was observed in the Ba(Fe_{1.\rm x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2} single crystals.[37, 38] In the d(R(T)/R(200 K))/dT versus T plot of (Ca_{0.9}Na_{0.1})Fe_{2}As_{2} in Fig. 3(b), a bulge can be observed around 150 K, which is consistent with the magnetic transition temperature. However, we cannot determine the structural and magnetic transition split in the polycrystalline samples. Further studies involving neutrons, low-temperature x-ray diffraction, and single crystals are required to investigate the transition split in (Ca_{1.\rm x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2}.

In Fig. 3(c), the susceptibility transformations attributed to the SDWs in (Ca_{0.68}Na_{0.32})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{0.67}Na_{0.33})Fe_{2}As_{2} can be observed at 65 and 50 K below 5 T. With a zero-field cooling (ZFC) signal at 30 Oe, the superconductivities can be observed at 14 and 15 K, respectively. Given the SDW transitions and the superconductivities in (Ca_{0.68}Na_{0.32})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{0.67}Na_{0.33})Fe_{2}As_{2}, SDW and superconductivity may therefore coexist in (Ca_{1.\rm x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} in the region of 0.3 <x< 0.36. The (Ba_{1.\rm x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system [15] exhibits a similar phenomenon in the region of 0.2 <x< 0.4. Moreover, the SDW anomaly in the (Ba_{1.\rm x},K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system occurs at about 140 K and is fully suppressed for x\approx 0.4.[15] The SDW temperatures of (Ca_{1.\rm x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ba_{1.\rm x},K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} are different, but they entirely disappear for x\approx 0.36 and 0.4, respectively. This phenomenon is attributed to the Fermi surface structure of 122-type parent compounds. The hole pockets at the \Gamma point and the same-size electron pockets at the M point in the Brillouin zone cause the SDW-type instability via strong interband nesting effects.[28, 34] In Na or K doping, the hole pockets expand, whereas the electron pockets shrink, resulting in a mismatch between the two kinds of pockets and the destruction of the interband nesting. Therefore, carrier density, as well as the Fermi surface size mismatch, plays a crucial role in suppressing the SDW anomaly in the two systems. In addition, phase separation is one possible cause of the SDW and superconductivity coexistence in a macroscopic scale. This possibility cannot be excluded based on the current experiment. In Ref. [15], for (Ba_{1.\rm x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2}, the phase separation is excluded from the high-resolution synchrotron x-ray experiment with \lambda = 0.1067 A because there is no peak split. However, in Ref. [39], a mesoscopic phase separation is observed using a Magnetic Force Microscope and muon spin rotation (\muSR). Further investigation is needed to confirm the occurrence of phase separation in (Ca_{1.\rm x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} using microscopic analysis.

In Fig. 3(d), both ZFC and field cooling (FC) signals at 30 Oe indicate a superconductivity transition at 17, 19, 22, 33, and 34 K for x = 0.36, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.66, respectively. Large superconducting volume fractions can be estimated from the FC signals, particularly for (Ca_{0.4}Na_{0.6})Fe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{0.34}Na_{0.66})Fe_{2}As_{2}, with a 35% superconducting volume fraction, which indicates the bulk superconducting nature of the samples. Moreover, the magnetic susceptibility evolutions for the x = 0.36 and x = 0.66 samples are different. For the x = 0.36 sample, the susceptibility monotonically decreases after the superconductivity transition. This result is the same as that of the authors of Ref. [36], who observed the superconductivity in (Ca,Na)Fe_{2}As_{2} with low Na doping. Their M(T) curves were also broad. This observation seems common for Ca122 with low Na doping partly because the inhomogeneity at low Na doping induces a broad transition.

The electronic transport measurement in Fig. 4(a) also indicates a transition at the superconducting temperature for the three distinct superconducting phases corresponding to x = 0.36, 0.5, and 0.66. This transition can be determined from the onset of the magnetic and resistivity curve transitions, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). The samples display a behavior similar to that of a metal at normal states with the ratios of residual resistance (RRRs) at 10, 18, and 30, respectively. Here, RRR = R_{300\rm K}/R_{0}, where R_{300\rm K} is

  the resistivity at 300 K, and R_{0} is the residual resistivity presumably extracted from T=0 K. Fig. 4(b) shows the effects of the magnetic field on the superconductivity transition for x=0.66 phases. The upper critical field H_{\rm c2} is determined using the middle point of the superconductivity transition. The slope of the curve at dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{\rm T=T_{c}} is -4.49 T/K. Taking 34 K as T_{\rm c}, based on the Werthdamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula[22] of H_{\rm c2}(0) = -0.693(dH_{\rm c2}/dT)T_{\rm c}, the upper critical fields are calculated as 106 T for the x=0.66 phases. The upper critical fields of the x=0.66 polycrystal are comparable with those of the x=0.66 single crystal,[19] indicating dH_{\rm c2}/dT|_{\rm T=T_{c}} slopes of -3.73 and -7.53 T/K for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm c}(0) and H_{\rm c2}^{\rm ab}(0) and, consequently, 85 and 172 T for H_{\rm c2}^{\rm c}(0) and H_{\rm c2}^{\rm ab}(0), respectively.

The specific-heat capacities of the polycrystalline samples with x=0.36, 0.5, and 0.66, respectively, are measured to further investigate the superconducting properties of the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system. In the normal state, the specific heat of a sample includes the electron C_{\rm el} and phone C_{\rm ph} contributions. At low temperatures, C_{\rm el}=\gamma_T_ and C_{\rm ph}=\beta_T_[3]. A second term of the harmonic-lattice approximation is used to improve the reliability at higher temperatures. Hence, Cn can be expressed as follows:

\[Cn=C_{\rm el}+C_{\rm ph}=\gamma\,T+\beta T^{3}+\eta T^{5}.\]

The data are fitted with Cn in a narrow region above Tc to determine the parameters. Then, \Delta C(C-Cn)/T is plotted versus Tc. In Fig. 5(a), no obvious jump is observed for C(T) between the 0 and 5 T magnetic fields, but a curvature change exists in the \Delta C/T curve of the x=0.36 sample around the transition temperature. This curvature change is attributed to the low superfluid density[23] and is similar to that of LaO_{1.x}F_{x}FeAs[24, 25] with Tc=26 K. A heat-capacity difference between the C(T) curve in the 0- to 5-T magnetic field, and the peak of the \Delta C/T curve around 22 K is observed for the x=0.5 sample in Fig. 5(b). Its maximum value is \Delta C/T\approx 20 mJ/(mol K^{2}). As seen in (Ba_{0.5}K_{0.5})Fe_{2}As_{2},[23]

(d) Magnetic susceptibilities [\chi(T)] of the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} for x=0.36, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.66 measured in a magnetic field H=30 Oe with both ZFC and FC modes.

  Fig. 5(c) shows a clear jump at 34 K for the x=0.66 sample. The jump is relatively sharp, and the value at its maximum is \Delta C/T\approx 66 mJ/(mol K^{2}).

A two-thirds Na doping at the Ca site is the limit to obtain a single phase in the current experiment. The nominal carrier densities for (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} with x=0.36, 0.5, and 0.66 are 0.18/Fe, 0.25/Fe, and 0.33/Fe, respectively. Compared with the samples with x=0.36 and 0.5, the sample with x=0.66 shows a higher Tc and a sharper superconductivity transition.

However, this case is not similar to that of the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system, where an optimal doping level of x=0.4 with Tc=38 K exists and the transition temperature decreases with higher doping levels. In Table 1, as the Na doping increases from x=0 to x=0.66, As-Fe-As (\alpha) decreases from 110.19 to 107.766 and As-Fe-As (\beta) increases from 109.11 to 110.331. The evolution of the FeAs tetrahedron in (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} has the same trend as that of the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system.[32] Meanwhile, the anion height of

  the Fe plane changes from 1.357 A of CaFe_{2}As_{2} to 1.401 A of (Ca_{0.34}Na_{0.66})Fe_{2}As_{2}. This change is consistent with the value change from 1.359 A of BaFe_{2}As_{2} to 1.379 A of (Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4})Fe_{2}As_{2}. In (Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4})Fe_{2}As_{2}, the FeAs tetrahedron is almost regular and the anion height is 1.38 A, which is recommended in Ref. [29] as the ideal empirical distance for high _Tc_. These results explain the x = 0.4 optimal doping level in the (Ba_{1-x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system.

These differences may be caused by the structure details of the two compounds, that is, Ca 122 is more sensitive to pressure [26, 27] or doping change. In fact, the superconductivity of Fe-based superconductors is very dependent on doping. [33] Furthermore, pressure and chemical doping have similar effects on the structure distortions of BaFe_{2}As_{2} superconductors, [32] implying that a higher _Tc_ could be stabilized under pressure in (Ca_{0.34}Na_{0.66})Fe_{2}As_{2}.

The temperature-composition phase diagrams of the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system in a wide Na doping range can be summarized and constructed based on the structural, magnetic, electronic transport, and heat-capacity measurements reported earlier. The structural and SDW transitions are suppressed almost linearly in the Na-doped samples in x<0.3 until x\approx 0.36, where no SDW transition occurs. For 0.3<x<0.36, SDW and superconductivity coexist in the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system, as also observed in the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} and SmFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x}[30] systems. However, superconductivity for 0.3<x<0.66 and higher _Tc_ with higher Na doping are observed, which are different from those in the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system.

## IV Conclusion

Single-crystalline CaFe_{2}As_{2} and (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} polycrystals (0<x<0.66) were grown and characterized using structural, magnetic, electronic transport, and heat-capacity measurements. As the Na doping was increased, the SDW transition was continuously suppressed and superconductivity was observed over a certain region. Hence, SDW and superconductivity may coexist in (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} in the 0.3<x<0.36 region. A temperature-composition phase diagram of the (Ca_{1.x}Na_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system was summarized, constructed, and compared with that of the (Ba_{1.x}K_{x})Fe_{2}As_{2} system. The carrier density and the size mismatch of the Fermi surfaces were found to be crucial factors in suppressing the SDW anomaly in Fe-based 122 systems.
