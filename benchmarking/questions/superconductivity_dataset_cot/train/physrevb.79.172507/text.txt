###### Abstract

We have discovered a member of superconductivity induced by hydrostatic pressure in an antiferromagnetic (AF) concentrated Kondo compound CePtSi\({}_{2}\) by measuring the resistivity and magnetoresistance. The AF transition temperature \(T_{\rm N}\) of 1.8 K at ambient pressure is suppressed by pressure and disappears around 1.2 GPa. Above 1.4 GPa, a superconducting phase appears between 1.4 and 2.4 GPa, with the maximum \(T_{\rm c}\) of 0.14 K at 1.7 GPa. The upper critical field of the superconductivity is evaluated to be 0.7 T, which is clearly larger than that of the Pauli limit predicted by the BCS theory.

pacs: 74.70.Tx, 71.27.+a The discovery and understanding of these phenomena in condensed matters give rise to the most important progress in this research field. A typical example is the so-called quantum phase transition, which is often accompanied by a new quantum phase, such as superconductivity [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and non-Fermi liquid [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] around the quantum critical point (QCP). In strongly correlated electron systems, various quantum phase transitions have been reported to be induced by controlling interactions of the spin, orbital, electron, phonon, and so on using external forces. In the concentrated Kondo Ce compounds, a competition between the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction and the Kondo effect can be tuned by changing hybridization of 4\(f\) orbital and conduction band. This is well displayed in the Doniach phase diagram [18] as a function of \(J_{\rm c}\)_I_/_D_(_E_F), where \(J_{\rm c}\)_f_ is the exchange interaction between \(f\) and conduction electrons, and \(D(E_{\rm F})\) is the density of states at the Fermi energy \(E_{\rm F}\). Magnetic-nonmagnetic quantum phase transition occurs when the Kondo effect overcomes RKKY interaction by changing magnetic field, chemical substitution, or pressure. In such sense, the concentrated Kondo compound CePtSi\({}_{2}\) is a possible candidate which exhibits a new quantum phase with an application of pressure, as will be mentioned in the following.

CePtSi\({}_{2}\) has a CeNiGe\({}_{2}\)-type orthorhombic layered structure (space group \(Cmcm\)), where the Ce and Pt-Si layers are stacked alternatively along the \(b\) axis, with lattice constants \(a\)= 4.288, \(b\)= 16.718, and \(c\)= 4.238 A, [19] as shown in Fig. 1. The electronic specific-heat coefficient \(\gamma\) of the paramagnetic state is 600 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) (Ref. [20]) and the characteristic Kondo temperature \(T_{\rm K}\) evaluated from the specific heat, resistivity, and magnetization measurements is 3 K. [19] An AF transition occurs around \(T_{\rm N}\)=2 K, which was associated with a jump in specific heat [21, 22, 23] and an upward bend in thermal expansion. [23] It has been found that pressure suppresses the AF phase and the QCP is predicted to exist around 1.1 GPa. [22] Non-Fermi-liquid behavior was observed around 1.1 GPa in which the resistivity shows linear \(T\) dependence in the low-temperature region (\(\sim\)2 K). [24] Conventional Fermi-liquid behavior, which is characterized by \(T^{2}\) dependence in the low-temperature resistivity, recovers above 2 GPa. [24] In this study, we attempted to measure the resistivity of CePtSi\({}_{2}\) under high pressure in the low-temperature region and found a superconductivity accompanied with disappearance AF phase by application of pressure.

A polycrystalline sample of CePtSi\({}_{2}\) was synthesized by arc-melting stoichiometric amounts of Ce (3N), Pt (4N), and Si (5N) in an Ar atmosphere. The obtained button was remelted several times to ensure homogeneity and annealed at 1000 \({}^{\circ}\)C in an evacuated quartz tube for three weeks. The result of electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) is shown in Table 1. It shows no dispersion in the concentration at the sample position indicating that homogenous chemical composition is close to that of stoichiometric CePtSi\({}_{2}\). Almost peaks in the powder x-ray diffraction pattern were indexed by CeNiGe\({}_{2}\)-type structure except some unidentified weak peaks associated with interplanar spacing \(d\)=3.615, 3.180, 2.600, and 2.507 A. The maximum peak intensity of the impurity phases with \(d\)=2.600 A is almost consistent with (112) and (103) reflection of CePt\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) (CaBe\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\)-type) [25] and CePtSi\({}_{3}\) (BaNiSn\({}_{3}\)-type), [26] respectively, and is as much as 10% of that for the matrix of CePtSi\({}_{2}\) indicating about sev

 eral percents impurity phases. The sample was cut by a spark cutter into a size of 0.5 x 1 x 1 mm3. The resistivity was measured by a standard ac four-probe method using an LR700 resistance bridge with a dilution refrigerator down to 50 mK under hydrostatic pressure up to 2.6 GPa. Pressure was generated using a NiCrAl-CuBe alloy hybrid piston-cylinder cell. [27] Daphne-oil 7373 was used as the pressure transmitting medium. A magnetic field up to 0.7 T was applied parallel to the current direction, using a 20 T superconducting magnet. The ac susceptibility was measured using a mutual-inductance method with a modulation frequency and field is 1 kHz and 0.02 Oe, respectively. Hydrostatic pressure was generated with the same setting as in the resistivity measurement.

Figure 2(a) displays the resistivity \(r\) of the polycrystalline CePtSi2 sample at various pressures. The excitation current was decreased stepwise with decreasing temperature, and is the order of 100 _m_A for the lowest measured temperature. At ambient pressure, \(r\) increases with decreasing temperature from 300 K and shows two maxima at 23 K (=_T_2) and 7 K (=_T_1). These two maxima are well-known characteristic features of Ce-based Kondo compounds, typical of interplay between the Kondo effect and crystal electric field (CEF) splitting. As the temperature is decreased further below 7 K, \(r\) decreases and shows a sharper decrease due to the AF transition. We defined the intersection of two linear lines extrapolated from just above and below the inflection point as _T_N, which was evaluated to be 1.8 K at ambient pressure. Below _T_N, \(r\) is proportional to \(T\)2 indicating conventional Fermi-liquid-like behavior. These are in fairly good agreement with previous measurements. [24]

In particular, the pressure clearly changes the overall features in _r_(_T_), as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). The effect of pressure on low-temperature resistivity is drastic. _T_N decreases with increasing pressure up to 0.79 GPa, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). The pressure dependence of _T_N, _dT_N/_dP_, is found to be -1 K/GPa, which is roughly consistent with the result of previous specific-heat measurement. [22] The anomaly due to the AF transition disappears above 0.9 GPa showing a deviation from the linear-pressure dependence of _T_N. Instead of the AF anomaly, another abrupt resistivity drop appears around 0.15 K above _P_c1=1.4 GPa suggesting a superconducting transition. This resistivity drop develops with increasing pressure up to 1.7 GPa and is observed up to _P_c2=2.1 GPa. We also measured the \(r\) with a low electric current of 10 _m_A at 1.7 GPa, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). \(r\) at 1.7 GPa with 10 _m_A current drops more sharply than that with 100 _m_A and is expected to be close to zero below 50 mK. Such current dependence of \(r\) is considered to be due to the self-heating by an excitation current, which that is a typical feature of superconductivity. We defined the crosspoint between two extrapolated lines just above and below the onset of the resistivity drop as the superconducting transition temperature _T_c, which was evaluated to be 0.14 K at 1.7 GPa. The values of _T_c and _T_N are shown in Fig. 3(a) as a function of pressure.

In addition, we measured the magnetoresistance of CePtSi2 at 1.7 GPa. Figure 4 shows the low-temperature resistivity with magnetic fields (_H_) up to 0.7 T, parallel to the excitation current direction. The resistivity drop due to the superconducting transition is suppressed by magnetic field and disappears above _H_=0.7 T. This is a further direct evidence of the superconducting transition in CePtSi2. Field dependence of _T_c is displayed in the inset (a) of Fig. 4. The upper critical field _H_c2 is found to be 0.7 T at 1.7 GPa. We evaluated _H_c2/_T_c to be 5 (T/K), which is clearly larger than the Pauli limit of 1.86 (T/K) predicted by the BCS theory.

The ac susceptibility _X_ac for the same sample at 1.8 GPa is shown in the inset (b) of Fig. 4. _X_ac drops below _T_c ~0.12 K, which is consistent with that evaluated from the resistivity measurement. This is also a clear evidence of superconducting ordering. This drop and _T_c are suppressed by application of a magnetic field and disappear above 0.3 T as shown in the inset (b) of Fig. 4. These behaviors are consistent with the results of the resistivity measurement. We evaluated the superconducting volume fraction of CePtSi2 at 0.04 K to be about 30%, indicating that the superconductivity of CePtSi2 should be a bulk phenomenon. Here, the difference between _X_ac(_H_=0 T) and the linear extrapolation of _X_ac(_H_=0.3 T) at 0.04 K is evaluated as the variation in the ac susceptibility _X_ac due to the superconducting ordering,

  as shown in the inset (b) of Fig. 4. This value is clearly larger than the ratio of the impurity phase(s) evaluated from the x-ray measurements. Thus, we conclude that the pressure-induced superconductivity of CePtSi\({}_{2}\) is an intrinsic phenomenon. On the other hand, zero resistivity was not observed despite the presence of bulk superconductivity indicating that current dependence of the resistivity below \(T_{c}\) is due to self-heating by an excitation current rather than the intrinsic current dependence of superconductivity. Indeed, the resistivity below \(T_{c}\) is close to zero with decreasing excitation current as shown in inset of Fig. 2(a).

The pressure dependence of the high-temperature resistivity is also interesting. As shown in Fig. 3(b), \(T_{1}\) increases with increasing pressure up to 0.9 GPa, whereas \(T_{2}\) decreases. The pressure dependence of \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) was reported for several Ce-based Kondo compounds, such as CeCu\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\),[28] CeCu\({}_{2}\)Ge\({}_{2}\),[29] and CeAl\({}_{2}\) (Ref. [30]) in which \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) are associated with modified Kondo temperatures owing to the CEF splitting. It should be noted that \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) merge into a single maximum (at \(T_{\rm max}\)) above 1.15 GPa. We defined the pressure as \(P_{V}\), which is nearly the same as \(P_{\rm c1}\). In general, the Kondo effect is enhanced by applying pressure because of the enhanced hybridization between the conduction \(d\) and magnetic \(f\) electrons due to the decrease in lattice constants and consequent overlap of CEF-split levels. Thus, the increases in \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{\rm max}\) indicate an increase in \(T_{\rm K}\). On the other hand, the decrease in \(T_{2}\) may be attributed to CEF rather than the variation in Kondo temperature.

Low-temperature resistivity around the QCP is well expressed by the relation \(\rho_{m}\)=\(\rho_{0}\)+\(A^{\prime}T^{n}\). Here \(\rho_{0}\) is the residual resistivity, \(A^{\prime}\) is a constant, and \(n\) is an exponent characteristic to the electronic and magnetic state of the materials. The parameter \(n\) is close to 2, 5/3, 3/2, and 1 in a conventional Fermi liquid, a three-dimensional ferromagnet, a three-dimensional antiferromagnet, and a two-dimensional antiferromagnet, respectively.[31, 32] Figure 3(c) displays \(\rho_{0}\) and \(n\) for CePtSi\({}_{2}\) evaluated by fitting the present experimental data between 0.2 and 0.8 K to the above equation as a function of pressure. \(\rho_{0}\) increases with pressure followed by a maximum around 1.2 GPa indicating an enhancement of Kondo fluctuation. The value of \(n\) is 2 at ambient pressure, and it decreases with increasing pressure and closes to 1 around 1.2 GPa, suggesting that the antiferromagnetism in CePtSi\({}_{2}\) has a two-dimensional interaction rather than a three-dimensional one. Above 1.2 GPa, \(n\) increases and becomes 1.6 at 2.6 GPa indicating the recovery of the Fermi-liquid state. The minimum of \(n\) and maximum of \(\rho_{0}\) show that a QCP of AF phase of CePtSi\({}_{2}\) exists around 1.2 GPa. The QCP is close to \(P_{\rm c1}\) as shown in Fig. 3(a) and smaller than the 2 GPa predicted from the initial slope of \(T_{\rm N}\) vs pressure (\(dT_{\rm N}\)/\(dP\)=\(-1\) K/GPa). The pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm N}\) is speculated as the dashed line shown in Fig. 3(a).

According to the magnetic interactions model,[31] the magnetic ordering temperature \(T_{\rm N}\) collapses owing to quantum fluctuation and is proportional to \(|P\)-\(P_{\rm c}|^{x}\), where \(x\)=2/3 and 1 for a three- and two-dimensional antiferromagnet, respectively.[2, 33] Indeed, \(T_{\rm N}\) shows linear decrease up to 0.79 GPa as shown in Fig. 3(a). Linear extrapolation of the pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm N}\), which is based on this model for the

  two-dimensional AF, is shown in Fig. 3(a) as a dash-dotted line. That crosses the \(P\) axis around \(P_{\text{c2}}\) indicating that the antiferromagnetism predicted by linear-pressure dependence is suppressed by evolving the superconducting phase.

Note that the superconducting phase appears above \(P_{V}\), which is consistent with the QCP of the AF phase, as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). Similar type of superconductivity is observed in CeCu\({}_{2}\)(Ge, Si)\({}_{2}\)[34, 35, 36, 37]. CeNiGe\({}_{3}\)[38], and Ce\({}_{2}\)Ni\({}_{3}\)Ge\({}_{2}\)[39] in which the superconducting phase appears around the \(P_{V}\). Jaccard _et al._[34] reported that the merging of \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) indicates an entrance in an intermediate valence state of Ce, while the \(T_{\text{K}}\) is of the order of the CEF splitting and Miyake _et al._[40, 41, 42] have pointed recently the possibility of Ce-based superconductivity due to the valence fluctuation. In CePtSi\({}_{2}\), the crossover from the concentrated Kondo state to an intermediate valence state is suggested from the change in the magnetoresistance [43] and resistivity [44] around \(P_{V}\). This intermediate valence state would further disturb the AF phase predicted by linear-pressure dependence around the \(P_{V}\). Judging from these results, we propose that the AF phase collapsed by magnetic-nonmagnetic quantum fluctuation is further suppressed by the valence fluctuation of Ce, and superconductivity arises in CePtSi\({}_{2}\).

In summary, the resistivity, magnetoresistance and ac susceptibility of a polycrystalline sample of an orthorhombic concentrated Kondo compound CePtSi\({}_{2}\) was measured under hydrostatic pressure. \(T_{\text{N}}\) decreases with increasing pressure and the QCP exists around 1.2 GPa. The superconducting phase appears between 1.4 and 2.4 GPa with the maximum \(T_{c}\) of 0.14 K at 1.7 GPa. Magnetoresistance measurement indicates that \(H_{\text{c2}}\) is 0.7 T at 1.7 GPa and is clearly larger than the Pauli limit predicted by the BCS theory. Non-Fermi-liquid behavior was observed around the QCP, and \(n\), the power of temperature dependence of resistivity, was evaluated to be \(\sim\)1. \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\), the modified Kondo temperatures, merge into a single \(T_{\text{max}}\) around 1.2 GPa which is consistent with the QCP. These results indicate that a superconductivity in CePtSi\({}_{2}\) is induced at high temperature owing to the quantum instability of the possible two-dimensional AF phase and the valence fluctuation of Ce.
