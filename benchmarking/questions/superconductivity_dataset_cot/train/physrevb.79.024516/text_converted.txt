###### Abstract

A compound with the FeAs-layers, namely, (Sr₃Sc₂O₅)Fe₂As₂ (abbreviated
as FeAs-32522), was successfully fabricated. It has a layered structure
with the space group of I4/_mmm_, and with the lattice constants a
=4.069 A and c =26.876 A. The in-plane Fe ions construct a square
lattice which is close to that of other FeAs-based superconductors, such
as REFeAsO (RE=rare earth elements) and (Ba,Sr)Fe₂As₂. However the
inter-FeAs-layer spacing in the compound is greatly enlarged. The
temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits a weak upturn in the
low-temperature region, but a metallic behavior was observed above about
60 K. The magnetic susceptibility shows also a nonmonotonic behavior.
Interestingly, the well-known resistivity anomaly which was discovered
in all other parent compounds, such as REFeAsO, (Ba,Sr)Fe₂As₂ and
(Sr,Ca,Eu)FeAsF and associated with the spin-density wave/structural
transition has not been found in the new system either on the
resistivity data or the magnetization data. This could be induced by the
large spacing distance between the FeAs-planes, therefore the
antiferromagnetic correlation between the moments of Fe ions in
neighboring FeAs layers cannot be established. Alternatively it can also
be attributed to the self-doping effect between Fe and Sc ions. The Hall
coefficient _R_(H)_ is negative but strongly temperature dependent in
wide temperature region, which indicates the dominance of electrical
conduction by electronlike charge carriers and probably a multiband
effect or a spin related scattering effect. It is found that the
magnetoresistance cannot be described by Kohler’s rule, which gives
further support to above arguments.

## I Introduction

Superconductivity in the FeAs-based systems has received tremendous
attention in last several months with the hope that the superconducting
transition temperature could be raised to a higher value.[1]
Experimentally, it has been found that the highest _T_(c)_ is about
55-57 K in the fluorine doped REFeAsO compound[2, 3] or RE doped
(Ca,Sr)FeAsF (RE=rare earth elements).[4] Meanwhile the family of the
FeAs-based superconductors has been expanded rapidly. In the system of
(Ba,Sr)_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (denoted as FeAs-122), the maximum _T_(c)_ at
about 38 K was discovered.[5, 6, 7] In the Li_(x)FeAs (denoted as
FeAs-111) system, superconductivity at about 18 K was found.[8, 9, 10]
In the material FeSe_(1 − x) which has no toxic arsenic and a more
simple structure,[11] it was shown that the sample became
superconducting at about 8 K. By doping or using a high pressure, the
_T_(c)_ can be pushed higher. Superconductivity at about 2.2 K has also
been found in a NiP-based layered structure La₃Ni₄O₂P₄ with the
intergrowth of NiP-1111 and 122 building blocks.[12] Very recently,
another kind of parent compounds (Sr,Ca,Eu)FeAsF were reported,[13, 14,
15, 16] which may lead to high-temperature superconductors by doping
charges into the system.

Empirically it is found that the superconducting transition temperature
rises when the inter-FeAs-layer spacing distance _d${}_{\rm FeAs}$_ is
increased (F-SmFeAsO: _T_(c)_ = 55 K, _d${}_{\rm FeAs}$_ =8.7 A;
(Sr,Ba)_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂: _T_(c)_ = 38 K, _d${}_{\rm FeAs}$_ =6.5 A;
Li_(x)FeAs: _T_(c)_ = 18 K, _d${}_{\rm FeAs}$_ =6.4 A) in the FeAs-based
superconductors. Surprisingly this seems to be quite similar to the case
in the cuprates. For example, by using the effective layers of CuO
planes in the cuprates, superconductors with different structures were
discovered. They can be categorized into the so-called single-layer
systems La_(1 − x)Sr_(x)CuO₄ and Bi₂Sr₂CuO₆ with the maximum _T_(c)_ of
about 38 K, or the double-layer systems YBa₂Cu₃O₇ and Bi₂Sr₂CaCu₂O₈ with
the optimal _T_(c)_ of about 85-92 K, or the triple-layer system
Bi₂Sr₂Ca₂Cu₃O₁₀ with the maximum _T_(c)_ of about 123 K (at ambient
pressure).[17] As inspired by the experience in the cuprate
superconductors, a larger separation between the superconducting planes
(here the FeAs layers) may lead to a higher _T_(c)_. Thus it becomes
very interesting to see whether it is possible to fabricate a compound
with larger spacing distance between the FeAs planes. In this paper, we
report the discovery of another kind of FeAs-based layered compound
(Sr₃Sc₂O₅)Fe₂As₂ (abbreviated as FeAs-32522), which has an inter
FeAs-layer spacing distance of about 13.438 A, being much larger than
those in all other parent compounds discovered so far, such as REFeAsO,
FeAs-122, and (Sr,Ca,Eu)FeAsF. The temperature dependence of
resistivity, magnetization, Hall effect, and magnetoresistance all
exhibit quite similar behaviors as other parent compounds, but with the
exception that the resistivity anomaly which was associated with the
spin-density wave (SDW)/structural transition[18] has not been found in
present system up to 400 K. Superconductivity may be induced by doping
electrons or holes in this compound.

## II Experiment

The compound Sr₃Sc₂O₅Fe₂As₂ was found while looking for iron arsenic
analogs of materials with this structure type seen in related chemical
systems.[19] The polycrystalline samples were fabricated by using a
two-step solid-state reaction method.[20] First, SrAs and ScAs powders
were obtained by the chemical reaction method with Sr pieces, Sc pieces,
and As grains. Then they were mixed with Sc₂O₃ (purity 99.9

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of our samples was carried out by a
_Mac-Science_ MXP18A-HF equipment with θ−2 θ scan. The XRD data taken
using powder sample was analyzed by the Rietveld fitting method using
the GSAS suite.[21] The starting parameters for the fitting were taken
from isostructural (Sr₃Sc₂O₃)Cu₂S₂ and the program will finally find the
best fitting parameters.[19] The dc magnetization measurements were done
with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) (Quantum
Design, MPMS7). For the magnetotransport measurements, the sample was
shaped into a bar with the length of 3 mm, width of 2.5 mm, and
thickness of about 0.8 mm. The resistance and Hall-effect data were
collected using a six-probe technique on the Quantum Design instrument
physical property measurement system (PPMS) with magnetic fields up to 9
T. The electric contacts were made using silver paste with the
contacting resistance below 0.06 Ω at room temperature. The data
acquisition was done using a dc mode of the PPMS, which measures the
voltage under an alternative dc current and the sample resistivity is
obtained by averaging these signals at each temperature. In this way the
contacting thermal power is naturally removed. The temperature
stabilization was better than 0.1

## III Analysis to the structural data

The XRD pattern for the sample (Sr₃Sc₂O₃)Fe₂As₂ is shown in Fig. 1. One
can see that the sample is very pure since no any visible peaks can be
detected from the impurity phase. The data was well fitted with a single
tetragonal (Sr₃Sc₂O₃)Fe₂As₂ phase with the space group of _I4_/_mmm_.
Rietveld refinement shown by the solid line in the figure gives good
agreement between the data and the calculated profiles. Lattice
parameters for the tetragonal unit cell was determined to be a=4.069 A
and c=26.876 A. In Table 1, the structure parameters, angles of As-Fe-As
and Fe-As-Fe (as marked in Fig. 2) were listed with agreement factors:
wR_(p)=11.75

It is clear that the a-axis lattice constant of this parent phase is
slightly larger than that of the REFeAsO, (Ba,Sr)Fe₂As₂, and
(Sr,Ca,Eu)FeAsF systems, while the c

axis one is much larger.[11, 13, 20, 22] The skeleton shown in the
right-hand side of Fig. 2 gives the structure model of our sample. It is
clear that the Fe ions construct a square lattice and the FeAs-layer
stacks with the (Sr₃Sc₂O₅) building block along c axis. The spacing
distance between two neighboring FeAs layers of about 13.438 A is much
larger than those in all other FeAs-based compounds discovered so far,
such as REFeAsO, (Ba,Sr)Fe₂As₂, and (Sr,Ca,Eu)FeAsF. This may induce
high T_(c) superconductivity by doping charges into the system. In fact,
this kind of structures were reported and classified to the general
formula (Cu₂S₂)(Sr_(n + 1)M_(n)O_(3n − 1)).[19]

## IV Electrical and magnetic properties

In Fig. 3(a) we present the temperature dependence of resistivity for
the (Sr₃Sc₂O₅)Fe₂As₂ sample under two magnetic fields 0 and 9 T. The
data under zero field were collected in temperature region up to 400 K.
A weak upturn in the low-temperature regime can be seen under both
fields, representing a weak semiconductorlike behavior for the present
sample. This behavior was attributed to the weak localization effect in
our sample. Interestingly, the similar weak upturn of resistivity was
observed in stoichiometric LaOFeP.[23] A metallic behavior can be seen
in the temperature dependence of resistivity in the temperature regime
above 60 K. Interestingly, no resistivity anomaly corresponding to the
SDW transition was observed up to 400 K. This can be further confirmed
by the magnetization data as shown in Fig. 3(b), which shows the
zero-field cooled dc magnetization at 5000 Oe. Again no anomaly was
observed in the magnetization data. This is rather different from other
FeAs-based parent compounds, such as REFeAsO,[1] (Ba,Sr)Fe₂As₂ (Refs.
[5] and [6]) and (Sr,Ca,Eu)FeAsF,[13] where clear resistivity and
magnetization anomaly associated with the SDW/structural transition have
been observed. We attribute it to the rather large spacing distance
between the neighboring FeAS layers in the present system, which
prevents from forming the antiferromagnetic correlation between the
moments of Fe ions in neighboring FeAs layers.

To further understand the conducting carriers in the present sample, we
also carried out the Hall-effect measurements on the present sample. The
inset of Fig. 4 shows the magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity
(ρ_(xy)) at different temperatures. In the experiment, ρ_(xy) was taken
as ρ_(xy) =[ρ(+H)−ρ(-H)]/2 at each point to eliminate the effect of the
misaligned Hall electrodes. It is clear that ρ_(xy) is negative at all
temperatures below 300 K for (Sr₃Sc₂O₅)Fe₂As₂ leading to a negative Hall
coefficient R_(H)=ρ_(xy)/H. This is similar to that of REFeAsO (Refs.
[24] and [25]) and (Ba,Sr)Fe₂As₂ parent phases, but in sharp contrast
with (Sr,Ca,Eu)FeAsF in which the positive Hall coefficient R_(H) was
found. The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_(H) is
presented in the main frame of Fig. 4. One can see that R_(H) remains
negative in wide temperature regime up to 300 K and the absolute value
of R_(H) decreases monotonically from 2 to 300 K. This indicates that
electron-type charge carriers dominate the conduction in the present
sample. The strong temperature dependent behavior of the Hall
coefficient R_(H) suggests either a strong multiband effect or a spin
related scattering effect. The absolute value of R_(H) is remarkably
smaller than that of SrFeAsF system, indicating a relatively higher
density of charge carriers.

The magnetoresistance (MR) is a very powerful tool to investigate the
properties of electronic scattering.[26, 27] Field dependence of MR for
the present sample at different temperatures is shown in the main frame
of Fig. 5. One can see a systematic evolution of the curvature in the
Δρ/ρ₀ vs H curve, where Δρ=ρ(H) − ρ₀, ρ(H) and ρ₀ represents the
longitudinal resistivity at a magnetic field H and that at zero field.
The MR data at 2 K is positive with a hump shape

below 2.3 T and becomes negative at higher fields. While at 5 K, a
maximum value of MR appears at about 3.3 T and it decreases until
becoming zero at 9 T. The data at 10 K have a downward curvature
compared with that measured at higher temperatures. We attribute the
complicated behavior at low temperatures, especially the negative MR
effect at 2 K, to the Kondo effect which is associated very well with
the upturn of resistivity or the magnetic susceptibility, or to the
magnetic field induced delocalization effect. The semiclassical
transport theory has predicted that Kohler’s rule will be held if only
one isotropic relaxation time is present in a solid-state system.[28]
Kohler’s rule can be written as

$$\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_{0}}=\frac{\rho(H)-\rho_{0}}{\rho_{0}}=F\left(\frac{H}{ \rho_{0}}\right).$$
(1)

This equation means that the Δρ/ρ₀ vs H/ρ₀ curves for different
temperatures, the so-called Kohler’s plot, should be scaled to a
universal curve if Kohler’s rule is obeyed. The scaling based on the
Kohler plot of our sample is revealed in the inset of Fig. 5. An obvious
violation of Kohler’s rule can be seen from this plot. This behavior may
indicate a multiband effect or a complicated scattering mechanism, such
as the Kondo effect or the weak localization in the low-temperature
region. This kind of upturn of resistivity and the magnetic
susceptibility in the low-temperature limit seem to be common features
for the parent phases of the FeAs-based compounds and further studies
are certainly required to unravel the underlying physics.

## V V. Concluding remarks

In summary, a parent phase of the FeAs-based family, (Sr₃Sc₂O₅)Fe₂As₂,
with the space group of I4/mmm was synthesized successfully using a
two-step solid-state reaction method. Rather large spacing distance
between the neighboring FeAs layers was found. No anomaly associated
with the AF order was observed either in the data of temperature
dependence of resistivity or dc magnetization, which was attributed to
the rather large spacing distance between the neighboring FeAs layers.
Strong Hall effect was observed in the temperature region up to 300 K.
We found that the Hall coefficient R_(H) is negative in the entire
temperature regime. We also observed a delocalization effect at low
temperatures from the MR data. The violation of Kohler’s rule along with
the strong temperature dependence of R_(H) may suggest a multiband
and/or a spin scattering effect in this system. By doping electrons or
holes in this compound, superconductivity may be achieved.
