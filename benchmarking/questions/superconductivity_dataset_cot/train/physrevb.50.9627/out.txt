## I Introduction

After the discovery of the family of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}_(_A_ represents R1-_x_Ca_{x} or R, where R = rare-earth element) layered copper oxides,[1] the so-called Pb-2213 phase continues to be of interest. Extensive structural studies have been carried out with x-ray diffraction,[1]^{-}4 neutron diffraction,[5] and electron microscopy.[6] Structurally the Pb-2213 phase is similar to both YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta}. The A layer is sandwiched between two CuO_{2} layers with a separation of approximately 1.62 A. Between sets of the double-pyramidal CuO_{2}-_A_-CuO_{2} layers, Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} has PbO-CuO_{8}-PbO sequenced layers. The double PbO layers are similar to the double BiO layers in Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} and the CuO_{8} layer is analogous to the chain layer of the oxygen-depleted YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.

The parent compounds Pb_{2}Sr_{2}RCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} are insulators.[1, 10] in which the Cu^{2+} spins in the CuO_{2} layers order antiferromagnetically,[9, 11] Substitution of the trivalent rare earth by Ca^{2+} provides hole doping in the CuO_{2} layers and induces superconductivity. Examples are Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(_R_1-_x_Ca_{x})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with R = Y, Er, Gd, Dy, Tm, and Sm, and these superconductors can have a _T_c higher than 80 K.[12] However, the superconducting volume fractions are usually less than 10%.[13, 14] The study of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(Y_{1-x}Ca_{x})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} ceramic samples with 0 \leq x \leq0.8 and \delta \sim 0 shows that the optimal doping condition is at half substitution (_x_ = 0.5) resulting in _T_c \approx 83 K.[15] The Ca-free Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_R_1-_y_Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with _R_-site cation vacancies (_y_ = 0.1-0.2) are also superconductors for R = Y, Eu, Ho, Dy, etc.[14] The _R_-site vacancies may function as zero-valence ions and therefore provide hole carriers to the neighboring CuO_{2} layers through charge balance.

Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}_ can incorporate excess oxygen up to d  1.9 from d  0.[9] The excess oxygen is located in the CuO_{8} plane between the two PbO layers, and oxidizes the Cu^{1+} to Cu^{2+} and the Pb^{2+} to Pb^{4+}. The oxidization process in the PbO-CuO_{8}-PbO layers seeks extra hole carriers from the adjacent CuO_{2} layer and suppresses the superconductivity.[9, 16] Therefore a N_{2} annealing process is usually employed to minimize the oxygen content d in superconducting Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}_.

The high-_T_c superconductors are highly anisotropic due to their layered structures. The anisotropy is usually expressed by a dimensionless parameter \gamma defined as \gamma \equiv _l_c /_l_ab, where _l_c and _l_ab are the superconducting penetration lengths for currents along the c axis and in the _ab_ plane, respectively. The equilibrium torque magnetometry method offers an unambiguous way to measure \gamma directly. This is because an anisotropic superconductor experiences a torque \tau = M x H in an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field H. The angular dependence of \tau(\theta) gives a direct measure of \gamma of the superconductor where \theta is the angle between the c axis and the applied H.[17]^{-}[19] This torque method has been used to study the anisotropy of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds[20]^{-}[21] and the Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} compounds.[25]\gamma \approx 8.5 for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and \gamma is on the order of 100-200 for Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta}.

Because of its similarity in structure to both YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta}, it is interesting to know whether the \gamma values of the Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}_ compounds are close to that of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} or Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta}. In this paper, we present anisotropy measurements of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(Y_{0.7}Ca_{0.3})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} and Pb_{2}Sr_{2}Y_{1-y}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} (y \approx 0.1). Results for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(Sm_{0.5}Eu_{0.5})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} superconducting single crystals are also included. Crystals with Er and Eu substitution rather than Y were also examined. More details are discussed in the following sections.

## II Experiments

Superconducting single crystals of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_R_1-_y_Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} and Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(_R_1-_x_Ca_{x})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} were prepared by a PbO/NaCl flux growth method.[12]^{-}[14] The as-grown crystals were extracted undamaged from  the PbO flux by using a methanol solvent in an ultrasonic bath.[13] Typical dimensions of the crystals were 1 x 1 x 0.3 mm3. A N2 annealing process at 500 degC for 100 h was used to reduce the excess oxygen content. Previous magnetization measurements of these crystals indicated superconducting transition widths of ~ 5 to more than 20 K and a small superconducting volume fraction ( < 10%).[13, 14] A Pb2Sr2(Sm0.5Eu0.5)Cu3O8+-d crystal was made in a similar way.

The rotating magnetic torque magnetometer described previously[21] was used. The torque on the sample, which caused a small deviation of the detection spring, was approximately proportional to the capacitance change between the spring and a counterelectrode. Each sample in the magnetometer was cooled slowly in zero field to below 100 K for the torque experiment. The torque experiments were performed in a 1.8 T field at a temperature several kelvins below the onset _T_c for most samples. During the experiment, the sample probe was rotated 190deg in both directions while a computer recorded the capacitance between the spring and the counterelectrode as a function of angle.

The torque signal was very small ( < 10-9 N m) with some samples due to a small volume fraction of superconductivity. It was then necessary to set the temperatures 10-15 K below the _T_c to increase _t_(_th_), but the _t_(_th_) was hysteretic due to fluxoid pinning. In this case the average of the curves for both directions of rotation was used for the fitting procedures described below.

## III Results and Discussion

In the field range _H_c2>_H_ >=_H_c1, the angular dependence of the equilibrium torque per unit volume is given by[18]

\[\tau(\theta) = \frac{\phi_{0}H}{64\pi^{2}\lambda^{2}}\frac{\gamma^{2} - 1}{\gamma^{1/3}}\frac{\sin(2\theta)}{\epsilon(\theta)}\ln\left[\frac{\gamma\eta H_{c2|}}{H\epsilon(\theta)}\right]\;,\]

where _e_(_th_)=(sin2_th_ + g ~2 cos2_th_)1/2, _th_ is the angle between the applied field H and the c axis, g ~2 _d_c/_l_ab, l = 3 g ~ 3 _l_c_l_ab, _H_c2| is the upper critical field along the c axis, and g is a constant of the order of unity which is dependent on the flux lattice structure. Equation (1) is based on the three-dimensional anisotropic London model.

Due to an uncertainty in determining the exact value of _th_ during experiments, a small angular offset D_th_ was left as a fitting parameter. Thus, four fitting parameters were used: g ~ _g_H_c2|; the amplitude, and _d_th_. Equation (1) has been tested by experiments with YBa2Cu3O7-8,[20,26,27] and with Bi2+Sr2Ca1-La2Cu2O8+-d.[28]

Figure 1 shows the normalized _t_(_th_) data for a Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+-d crystal in the angular range 90deg> _th_ ~ 0. The maximum torque of the sample was of the order of 10-8 N m. The solid curve with g = 10.2 is the least _kh_2 fit of Eq. (1) to the data.

The Be-Cu spring was slightly magnetic and gave a sinusoidal background,[21] which needed to be subtracted before data analysis. Because of the weak torque signals from some samples, in general the _t_(_th_) data after background subtraction were slightly asymmetric in the angular range 180deg> _th_ ~ 0. In order to get a reliable g value, the angular range for the fitting was chosen to be 100deg> _th_ ~ 80deg with more than 50 points. Previous experience indicated that the g values thus obtained are consistent (to within 3-10 %) with those obtained by fitting in the range 180deg> _th_ ~ 0.[21]

Figure 2 shows the _t_(_th_) data for two samples in the angular range 100deg> _th_ ~ 80deg. In order not to overlap the data, arbitrary units of torque are chosen. The solid curves are the least _kh_2 fit; of Eq. (1)

  to the data. The best-fit \gamma values for these data sets are 10.4 and 11.9 for Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2(Sm0.5Eu0.5)Cu3O8+, respectively.

The uncertainty of the fitting parameter \Delta\theta always converged to about 2\times 10^{-2} deg for \gamma\approx 10 and is a negligible factor (\approx1% correction) in the \gamma determination. Also, the angular correction for the deviation of the spring resulted in an increase of the \gamma value of 1-2 %.

The \gamma value, the diamagnetic onset T_{c} and the transition width of our Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and and Pb2Sr2Y1-_Cu3O8+ crystals and a Pb2Sr2(Sm0.5Eu0.5)Cu3O8+ crystal are summarized in Table 1.

Attempts to measure the \gamma values of non-yttrium Pb2Sr2(_R_1-_x_Ca_x_)Cu3O8+ crystals were made. The \gamma values of Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ were in the range 24-30, and were considerably larger than those of Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Y1-_Cu3O8+. Given that the \gamma values of _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_(_R_ = Y, Er, Lu, Dy, and Gd) are all close to 8.7,29 it is somewhat surprising for the Pb2Sr2_A_Cu3O8+ compounds to have a large spread in \gamma values for different rare-earth elements. One possible cause is that the sample quality of the Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ was less good because their T_{c}'s lower lower (\approx 55 K). Previous measurements show that the optimal T_{c} values can be higher than 70 and 80 K for Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+, respectively.14 This implies that our Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ crystals with T_{c}\approx 55 K are less than optimally doped. Studies of oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ crystals show a large increase of \gamma values along with a suppression of T_{c} when the doping level is decreased.24 The same phenomenon _probably_ accounts for the larger \gamma values of our Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ crystals. More samples with optimal preparation conditions are needed to settle this issue.

Previous transport studies of the Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ single crystals showed the resistivity anisotropy ratio \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\approx 30,13 which is comparable to \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\approx 40 of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_.30 Given their structural similarity and comparable \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} values, it is not surprising that the \gamma value of Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ is comparable to that of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_(_g_ = 8.5). One of the reasons for the larger \gamma (10-11) of Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Y1-_Cu3O8+_ may be their larger c-axis lattice constants. The c-axis lattice constant of Pb2Sr2_A_Cu3O8+ is in the range 15.75-15.80 A and that of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ is ~11.7 A. This larger c-axis separation presumably reduces the interlayer coupling and in general increases the anisotropy.

Another possible reason for the larger \gamma values is the lower hole concentration. Recent optical conductivity measurements of Pb2Sr2_A_Cu3O8+ (Ref. 31) indicated a smaller normal-state low-frequency electronic background compared to that of YBa2Cu3O7-_b_, yet the anisotropy was about the same as that of YBa2Cu3O7-_b_. The lower electronic background implies a lower hole doping level, which would also increase the anisotropy, as is the case for oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7-_d_.24

Due to the small superconducting volume fraction and wide transition width, \lambda cannot be extracted from Eq. (1) by fitting procedures. Previous magnetization measurements by Reedyk _et al_. gave an estimate of \lambda_{ab}(0) of \approx 2600 A, by using \lambda_{ab}^{2} = \Phi/(32\pi^{2}dM_{\parallel c}/d{\ln}H) with the field along the c axis.32 Their measurements with the field in the ab plane and along the c axis indicated an H_{c1}(0) anisotropy of approximately 5, and (dM_{\parallel c}/d{\ln}H)/(dM_{\parallel c}/d{\ln}H)\approx 2.5 at fields close to H_{c2}. Such measurements are sensitive to misalignment which could reduce the measured anisotropy, and they represent a lower limit of the magnetic anisotropy. Another example would be the H_{c2} measurements of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ along different directions by the dc magnetization method, with anisotropy ratio of approximately 5,33 The present torque measurements of Pb2Sr2_A_Cu3O8+ also show that the anisotropy is larger.

## IV Conclusions

The \gamma values of Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Y1-_Y_Cu3O8+ are in the range 10-11. These \gamma value are comparable to \gamma\approx 8.5 of YBa2Cu3O7-_b_. For Pb2Sr2(Sm0.5Eu0.5)Cu3O8+ single crystals, \gamma = 13\pm3.

Measurements on Pb2Sr2(_R_1-_x_Ca_x_)Cu3O8+ crystals with R other than Y were attempted. For Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Y_Cu3O8+ crystals with lower T_{c}, \gamma values are in the range 25-30. We attribute their larger \gamma values to a reduced hole doping level as evidence by their lower T_{c} values.

## I Introduction

After the discovery of the family of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}_(_A_ represents R1-_x_Ca_{x} or R, where R = rare-earth element) layered copper oxides,[1] the so-called Pb-2213 phase continues to be of interest. Extensive structural studies have been carried out with x-ray diffraction,[1]^{-}4 neutron diffraction,[5] and electron microscopy.[6] Structurally the Pb-2213 phase is similar to both YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta}. The A layer is sandwiched between two CuO_{2} layers with a separation of approximately 1.62 A. Between sets of the double-pyramidal CuO_{2}-_A_-CuO_{2} layers, Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} has PbO-CuO_{8}-PbO sequenced layers. The double PbO layers are similar to the double BiO layers in Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} and the CuO_{8} layer is analogous to the chain layer of the oxygen-depleted YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}.

The parent compounds Pb_{2}Sr_{2}RCu_{3}O_{8+\delta} are insulators.[1, 10] in which the Cu^{2+} spins in the CuO_{2} layers order antiferromagnetically,[9, 11] Substitution of the trivalent rare earth by Ca^{2+} provides hole doping in the CuO_{2} layers and induces superconductivity. Examples are Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(_R_1-_x_Ca_{x})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with R = Y, Er, Gd, Dy, Tm, and Sm, and these superconductors can have a _T_c higher than 80 K.[12] However, the superconducting volume fractions are usually less than 10%.[13, 14] The study of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(Y_{1-x}Ca_{x})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} ceramic samples with 0 \leq x \leq0.8 and \delta \sim 0 shows that the optimal doping condition is at half substitution (_x_ = 0.5) resulting in _T_c \approx 83 K.[15] The Ca-free Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_R_1-_y_Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} with _R_-site cation vacancies (_y_ = 0.1-0.2) are also superconductors for R = Y, Eu, Ho, Dy, etc.[14] The _R_-site vacancies may function as zero-valence ions and therefore provide hole carriers to the neighboring CuO_{2} layers through charge balance.

Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}_ can incorporate excess oxygen up to d  1.9 from d  0.[9] The excess oxygen is located in the CuO_{8} plane between the two PbO layers, and oxidizes the Cu^{1+} to Cu^{2+} and the Pb^{2+} to Pb^{4+}. The oxidization process in the PbO-CuO_{8}-PbO layers seeks extra hole carriers from the adjacent CuO_{2} layer and suppresses the superconductivity.[9, 16] Therefore a N_{2} annealing process is usually employed to minimize the oxygen content d in superconducting Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}_.

The high-_T_c superconductors are highly anisotropic due to their layered structures. The anisotropy is usually expressed by a dimensionless parameter \gamma defined as \gamma \equiv _l_c /_l_ab, where _l_c and _l_ab are the superconducting penetration lengths for currents along the c axis and in the _ab_ plane, respectively. The equilibrium torque magnetometry method offers an unambiguous way to measure \gamma directly. This is because an anisotropic superconductor experiences a torque \tau = M x H in an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field H. The angular dependence of \tau(\theta) gives a direct measure of \gamma of the superconductor where \theta is the angle between the c axis and the applied H.[17]^{-}[19] This torque method has been used to study the anisotropy of the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} compounds[20]^{-}[21] and the Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} compounds.[25]\gamma \approx 8.5 for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and \gamma is on the order of 100-200 for Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta}.

Because of its similarity in structure to both YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} and Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta}, it is interesting to know whether the \gamma values of the Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_4Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta}_ compounds are close to that of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} or Bi_{2+x}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta}. In this paper, we present anisotropy measurements of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(Y_{0.7}Ca_{0.3})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} and Pb_{2}Sr_{2}Y_{1-y}Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} (y \approx 0.1). Results for Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(Sm_{0.5}Eu_{0.5})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} superconducting single crystals are also included. Crystals with Er and Eu substitution rather than Y were also examined. More details are discussed in the following sections.

## II Experiments

Superconducting single crystals of Pb_{2}Sr_{2}_R_1-_y_Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} and Pb_{2}Sr_{2}(_R_1-_x_Ca_{x})Cu_{3}O_{8+\delta} were prepared by a PbO/NaCl flux growth method.[12]^{-}[14] The as-grown crystals were extracted undamaged from  the PbO flux by using a methanol solvent in an ultrasonic bath.[13] Typical dimensions of the crystals were 1 x 1 x 0.3 mm3. A N2 annealing process at 500 degC for 100 h was used to reduce the excess oxygen content. Previous magnetization measurements of these crystals indicated superconducting transition widths of ~ 5 to more than 20 K and a small superconducting volume fraction ( < 10%).[13, 14] A Pb2Sr2(Sm0.5Eu0.5)Cu3O8+-d crystal was made in a similar way.

The rotating magnetic torque magnetometer described previously[21] was used. The torque on the sample, which caused a small deviation of the detection spring, was approximately proportional to the capacitance change between the spring and a counterelectrode. Each sample in the magnetometer was cooled slowly in zero field to below 100 K for the torque experiment. The torque experiments were performed in a 1.8 T field at a temperature several kelvins below the onset _T_c for most samples. During the experiment, the sample probe was rotated 190deg in both directions while a computer recorded the capacitance between the spring and the counterelectrode as a function of angle.

The torque signal was very small ( < 10-9 N m) with some samples due to a small volume fraction of superconductivity. It was then necessary to set the temperatures 10-15 K below the _T_c to increase _t_(_th_), but the _t_(_th_) was hysteretic due to fluxoid pinning. In this case the average of the curves for both directions of rotation was used for the fitting procedures described below.

## III Results and Discussion

In the field range _H_c2>_H_ >=_H_c1, the angular dependence of the equilibrium torque per unit volume is given by[18]

\[\tau(\theta) = \frac{\phi_{0}H}{64\pi^{2}\lambda^{2}}\frac{\gamma^{2} - 1}{\gamma^{1/3}}\frac{\sin(2\theta)}{\epsilon(\theta)}\ln\left[\frac{\gamma\eta H_{c2|}}{H\epsilon(\theta)}\right]\;,\]

where _e_(_th_)=(sin2_th_ + g ~2 cos2_th_)1/2, _th_ is the angle between the applied field H and the c axis, g ~2 _d_c/_l_ab, l = 3 g ~ 3 _l_c_l_ab, _H_c2| is the upper critical field along the c axis, and g is a constant of the order of unity which is dependent on the flux lattice structure. Equation (1) is based on the three-dimensional anisotropic London model.

Due to an uncertainty in determining the exact value of _th_ during experiments, a small angular offset D_th_ was left as a fitting parameter. Thus, four fitting parameters were used: g ~ _g_H_c2|; the amplitude, and _d_th_. Equation (1) has been tested by experiments with YBa2Cu3O7-8,[20,26,27] and with Bi2+Sr2Ca1-La2Cu2O8+-d.[28]

Figure 1 shows the normalized _t_(_th_) data for a Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+-d crystal in the angular range 90deg> _th_ ~ 0. The maximum torque of the sample was of the order of 10-8 N m. The solid curve with g = 10.2 is the least _kh_2 fit of Eq. (1) to the data.

The Be-Cu spring was slightly magnetic and gave a sinusoidal background,[21] which needed to be subtracted before data analysis. Because of the weak torque signals from some samples, in general the _t_(_th_) data after background subtraction were slightly asymmetric in the angular range 180deg> _th_ ~ 0. In order to get a reliable g value, the angular range for the fitting was chosen to be 100deg> _th_ ~ 80deg with more than 50 points. Previous experience indicated that the g values thus obtained are consistent (to within 3-10 %) with those obtained by fitting in the range 180deg> _th_ ~ 0.[21]

Figure 2 shows the _t_(_th_) data for two samples in the angular range 100deg> _th_ ~ 80deg. In order not to overlap the data, arbitrary units of torque are chosen. The solid curves are the least _kh_2 fit; of Eq. (1)

  to the data. The best-fit \gamma values for these data sets are 10.4 and 11.9 for Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2(Sm0.5Eu0.5)Cu3O8+, respectively.

The uncertainty of the fitting parameter \Delta\theta always converged to about 2\times 10^{-2} deg for \gamma\approx 10 and is a negligible factor (\approx1% correction) in the \gamma determination. Also, the angular correction for the deviation of the spring resulted in an increase of the \gamma value of 1-2 %.

The \gamma value, the diamagnetic onset T_{c} and the transition width of our Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and and Pb2Sr2Y1-_Cu3O8+ crystals and a Pb2Sr2(Sm0.5Eu0.5)Cu3O8+ crystal are summarized in Table 1.

Attempts to measure the \gamma values of non-yttrium Pb2Sr2(_R_1-_x_Ca_x_)Cu3O8+ crystals were made. The \gamma values of Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ were in the range 24-30, and were considerably larger than those of Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Y1-_Cu3O8+. Given that the \gamma values of _R_Ba2Cu3O7-_d_(_R_ = Y, Er, Lu, Dy, and Gd) are all close to 8.7,29 it is somewhat surprising for the Pb2Sr2_A_Cu3O8+ compounds to have a large spread in \gamma values for different rare-earth elements. One possible cause is that the sample quality of the Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ was less good because their T_{c}'s lower lower (\approx 55 K). Previous measurements show that the optimal T_{c} values can be higher than 70 and 80 K for Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+, respectively.14 This implies that our Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ crystals with T_{c}\approx 55 K are less than optimally doped. Studies of oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ crystals show a large increase of \gamma values along with a suppression of T_{c} when the doping level is decreased.24 The same phenomenon _probably_ accounts for the larger \gamma values of our Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Cu3O8+ crystals. More samples with optimal preparation conditions are needed to settle this issue.

Previous transport studies of the Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ single crystals showed the resistivity anisotropy ratio \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\approx 30,13 which is comparable to \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\approx 40 of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_.30 Given their structural similarity and comparable \rho_{c}/\rho_{ab} values, it is not surprising that the \gamma value of Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ is comparable to that of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_(_g_ = 8.5). One of the reasons for the larger \gamma (10-11) of Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Y1-_Cu3O8+_ may be their larger c-axis lattice constants. The c-axis lattice constant of Pb2Sr2_A_Cu3O8+ is in the range 15.75-15.80 A and that of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ is ~11.7 A. This larger c-axis separation presumably reduces the interlayer coupling and in general increases the anisotropy.

Another possible reason for the larger \gamma values is the lower hole concentration. Recent optical conductivity measurements of Pb2Sr2_A_Cu3O8+ (Ref. 31) indicated a smaller normal-state low-frequency electronic background compared to that of YBa2Cu3O7-_b_, yet the anisotropy was about the same as that of YBa2Cu3O7-_b_. The lower electronic background implies a lower hole doping level, which would also increase the anisotropy, as is the case for oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7-_d_.24

Due to the small superconducting volume fraction and wide transition width, \lambda cannot be extracted from Eq. (1) by fitting procedures. Previous magnetization measurements by Reedyk _et al_. gave an estimate of \lambda_{ab}(0) of \approx 2600 A, by using \lambda_{ab}^{2} = \Phi/(32\pi^{2}dM_{\parallel c}/d{\ln}H) with the field along the c axis.32 Their measurements with the field in the ab plane and along the c axis indicated an H_{c1}(0) anisotropy of approximately 5, and (dM_{\parallel c}/d{\ln}H)/(dM_{\parallel c}/d{\ln}H)\approx 2.5 at fields close to H_{c2}. Such measurements are sensitive to misalignment which could reduce the measured anisotropy, and they represent a lower limit of the magnetic anisotropy. Another example would be the H_{c2} measurements of YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ along different directions by the dc magnetization method, with anisotropy ratio of approximately 5,33 The present torque measurements of Pb2Sr2_A_Cu3O8+ also show that the anisotropy is larger.

## IV Conclusions

The \gamma values of Pb2Sr2(Y0.7Ca0.3)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Y1-_Y_Cu3O8+ are in the range 10-11. These \gamma value are comparable to \gamma\approx 8.5 of YBa2Cu3O7-_b_. For Pb2Sr2(Sm0.5Eu0.5)Cu3O8+ single crystals, \gamma = 13\pm3.

Measurements on Pb2Sr2(_R_1-_x_Ca_x_)Cu3O8+ crystals with R other than Y were attempted. For Pb2Sr2(Er0.5Ca0.5)Cu3O8+ and Pb2Sr2Eu1-_Y_Cu3O8+ crystals with lower T_{c}, \gamma values are in the range 25-30. We attribute their larger \gamma values to a reduced hole doping level as evidence by their lower T_{c} values.
