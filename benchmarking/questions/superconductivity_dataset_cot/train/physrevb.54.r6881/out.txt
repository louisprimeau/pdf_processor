###### Abstract

We report on the effect of Co impurity substitution on the anisotropic transport properties of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} single crystals. With Co doping, there is an increase in anisotropy \gamma estimated from the scaling of the angular dependence of the in-plane resistivity with reduced field as well as in the out-of-plane resistivity. These results can be quantitatively explained by the two-dimensional Lawrence-Doniach model, if we assume that the anisotropy in the superconducting state is determined by the interlayer coupling just above T_{c}. The analysis highlights the specific feature in high-T_{c} cuprates that the effective interlayer coupling depends on temperature. [S0163-1829(96)50234-1]

The highly anomalous transport[1] and optical[2] properties on the interlayer charge dynamics are key issues in high-T_{c} superconductivity.[3; 4] However, whether or not the interlayer charge transport is inherently incoherent is still an open question. Furthermore, although many models have been proposed to explain "'semiconductive" out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c}, which is usually observed in the underdoped cuprates, there is no consensus as yet.[5]

We have previously shown that the impurity effect on the anisotropic transport properties is a sensitive probe for investigating the interlayer charge dynamics.[6; 7] This approach is based on the idea that the impurity averages one-electron state according to its dimensionality. If the system is anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) (coherent in the interlayer charge transport), a reduction of the anisotropy can be expected through the averaging of the gap functions \Delta since coherence length \xi^{\alpha}\hbar v_{F}/\Delta from the clean limit BCS. Indeed, we have observed such impurity-induced reduction of the anisotropy ratio \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}, where \xi_{ab} is the in-plane and \xi_{c} the out-of-plane coherence length, as well as an increase in \rho_{c} due to the impurity scattering in fully oxidized Ba_{2}Y(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta}[6]. On the other hand, if the system is strictly 2D with almost no dispersion along the c axis (incoherent in the interlayer charge transport), the impurity causes averaging of only in-plane states and the system obeys the Lawrence-Doniach (LD) description.[8] As a result, in general, no change in the anisotropy or in the magnitude of \rho_{c} can be expected. These arguments are valid even when the superconductivity is non-s wave because they are derived only from the nature of the one-electron state, while \xi's themselves will increase due to the impurity pair breaking effect in the case of d-wave superconductivity.

In this paper, we investigate the impurity effect on the superconducting coherence length \xi and the normal-state transport properties \rho_{a},\rho_{c} of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} single crystals, focusing on the interlayer charge dynamics. The obtained anisotropic parameter value, \gamma=\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}=(m_{c}/m_{ab})^{1/2}, and \rho_{c} increased with Co doping. These results were analyzed using the LD model. Based on this analysis, we discuss the mechanism causing "'semiconductive" \rho_{c}. Here, to estimate anisotropy in the superconducting state, we first measured the in-plane resistive transition under various magnetic fields (**B||c**). Data were analyzed using the superconducting-fluctuation-renormalized Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory (Ikeda _et al._),[9] which has succeeded in explaining the characteristic broadening phenomena of the resistive transition. For more accurate estimation of \gamma, we then measured the in-plane resistivity \rho_{a} as a function of the magnetic field direction in the reversible regime. Scaling rules developed for strong type II superconductors (Blatter _et al._),[10] were used for the analysis.

Single crystals were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method. TSFZ has a fundamental advantage that homogeneous impurity doping is possible. The single crystals were annealed in air at 600 degC for 24 h \sim 36 h, then rapidly cooled in air or slowly cooled under equilibrium oxygen pressures, which were controlled by oxygen and argon flow ratio, at each temperature. The latter process ensured both uniform oxygen content and minimum disorder in the crystals, which were used for the measurement of field direction dependence for the \rho_{a} as well as for the \rho_{c} measurement. We measured \rho_{a} with the standard four-probe method, while \rho_{c} was measured with a four-probe-like method with the voltage contacts attached to the center of the ab plane and the current contacts covering almost all of the remaining space.[11]

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivities \rho_{a} for pure and Co 4% doped single-crystal Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta}. The room-temperature value of \rho_{a} for pure sample is typically \approx 250 \mu\Omega cm. The temperature dependence is nearly linear, but contains a small quadratic component, suggesting the samples are in the overdoped region. Impurity (Co) doping to 4% primarily caused large (\approx 160 \mu\Omega cm) residual resistivity, which was estimated from the intercept of \rho_{a0}, the bare in-plane resistivity, where the effect of the superconductive fluctuation is eliminated, as shown below. It also caused a slight increase in the slope of d\rho_{a}/dT from \approx0.83 \mu\Omega cm/K for the pure sample to \approx1.2 \mu\Omega cm/K for the doped one, implying the carrier concentration decreased slightly due to the trivalent Co substitution for Cu. However, the samples are overdoped even when Co is doped because tentative reductions in the oxygen content of these samples raised their T_{c}.

  Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show, respectively, the in-plane resistive transition under the various magnetic fields {\bf B}(\parallel c) for the pure and Co 4% doped single-crystal Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta}. Theoretical fits plotted according to the fluctuation-renormalized GL theory [9] are also shown. In both sets of experimental data, there are large decreases in the \rho_{a} , probably due to the superconductive fluctuation, from far (20-30 K) above T_{c} and typical tailing behavior at low temperatures in the magnetic fields. These are caused by the fluctuation enhanced by the short coherence length, high T_{c} , electronic two-dimensionality, and the one-dimensionalization of the fluctuation under a high magnetic field. In the analysis, the \rho_{a0} was assumed to be a linear extrapolation of the resistivity at higher temperatures. Here, when there was no magnetic field, the well-known Aslamasov-Larkin (AL) type description for the fluctuation was assumed. [9] The analysis was done concentrating on the high-field data, because the model was justified in the high-field limit. The fitting reproduces well the characteristic features of the data, although it was not complete. The fact that the resistivity at low temperatures is smaller than that predicted by the theory suggests that a vortex motion begins to play some role in the dissipation. Although the theoretical formula used (AL fluctuation) is derived assuming conventional (s-wave) superconductivity, it is expected to be valid with possible changes in the numerical factors in the case of d-wave superconductivity, since it is based on the one-component GL theory. Actually, the reasonable fit results here for Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} and for Ba_{2}Y(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. 6) imply that the description based on one-component GL theory may not need much modification even in the case of d-wave superconductivity.

The obtained parameters, i.e., the mean field critical temperature T_{c0}, specific-heat jump \Delta C, the phenomenological C factor, which adjusts the magnitude of the fluctuation effect, \xi_{ab} , and \xi_{c} are listed in Table I. The T_{c0} is slightly higher than the observed temperatures at zero resistivity with no magnetic field, suggesting the occurrence for Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) like transition reflecting the two-dimensionality of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} system. [12] The \Delta C values agree with the reported values [13] obtained by direct measurement. The C factors are smaller than 1, implying that the effect of the superconducting fluctuation is enhanced for some unknown reasons. A reasonable \xi_{ab} value for the pure sample is obtained. With Co doping, the \xi_{ab} value increased, probably due to the reduction of the gap \Delta, since \xi\propto\hbar\upsilon_{F}/\Delta. The very small (0.1 A) \xi_{c} in each system well reproduced the data, but the theoretical curve became insensitive for further reduction of \xi_{c} . Thus, the extreme anisotropy in the superconducting state for the pure Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system was found to be maintained upon Co doping. However, precise estimation of the change in the anisotropy is impossible from only the present analysis.

Next, \rho_{a} was measured as a function of the angle \theta (-15^{\circ}<\theta<5^{\circ}) between the a axis and the magnetic field {\bf B} ({\bf B} lies in the ac plane) in the reversible region [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. Blatter _et al._ have shown [9] that the angle-dependent values of \rho_{a} under various constant fields {\bf B} at a fixed temperature are scaled on one curve against the reduced field B_{\rm red}=B(sin^{2}\theta+\gamma^{-2}cos^{2}\theta) [12]. Because this scaling rule is based on GL or London equations assuming only a strong type II superconductor, it is widely accepted to be valid for high-T_{c} cuprates [14] and is used to estimate anisotropic parameter \gamma. This way of obtaining \gamma has an advantage of higher accuracy, even in an extremely anisotropic case such as the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system, than the analysis of temperature dependence for the resistive superconducting-transition described above. The experimen

The solid curves are the theoretical fits with the parameters listed in Table I. The \rho_{a0} represents the in-plane resistivity when superconductive fluctuation effects were absent.

Figure 1: In-plane resistivities \rho_{a} of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} (x = 0.0.04) single crystals versus temperature. The temperatures at which \rho_{a} becomes zero are 84 and 60 K for the pure (x = 0) and Co 4% doped (x = 0.04) samples, respectively.

  tal data in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) indicate sharpening near the parallel field (\theta = 0deg) as Co is doped, implying an increase in anisotropy. In some thicker samples, we have observed a double minimum near the parallel field, which was probably caused by the slightly misaligned domain structure. To avoid such an artifact, we carefully cleaved samples to \approx 0.01 mm thickness before the transport measurements. The scaling of \rho_{a} as a function of the reduced field _B_red gives \gamma = 100 \pm 10 and = 220 \pm 10 for the pure and Co 4% doped sample, respectively. Consequently, we did not observe any impurity-induced reduction of the anisotropy, which was expected in anisotropic 3D systems. Instead, we observed an increase in anisotropy \gamma = \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} in the superconducting state. According to the 2D LD model (Josephson-coupled superconductivity).8\xi_{c} = \xi_{ab}(_m__ab_/_m__c_)1/2deg \xi_{ab}/1deg, where _t__{\perp} is the interlayer coupling constant. Thus, the observed impurity induced increase in anisotropy by 2.2 times that of the pure sample means the decrease in _t__{\perp} by (2.2) ^{- 2}\approx 0.21 times that of the pure sample.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} for pure and Co 4% doped single-crystal Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta}. The two \rho_{c} curves for Co-doped samples show typical sample dependence for \rho_{c} measurement. Our early data on \rho_{c} for the Co-doped sample was scattered from sample to sample. Since the out-of-plane properties are very sensitive to the oxygen content, this is considered to be caused by an oxygen inhomogeneity in the sample during cooling. To eliminate the ambiguity in the oxygen content, we improved the annealing process; the equilibrium oxygen pressures are maintained down to sufficiently low temperature (\approx300 degC). Thus we obtained reliable data on \rho_{c} for the Co-doped samples, as shown in Fig. 4.

Because all the values of \rho_{c} far exceed Mott's limit (\approx 10^{- 2}\Omegacm),[15] the out-of-plane conduction can be considered as a tunneling mechanism, \rho_{c} \propto(N_{0}_t_{\perp}_)^{- 1}, where N0 is the in-plane density of states. The observed impurity induced change in \rho_{c} could then be attributed to the change in the _t__{\perp} or the N0. It is natural to consider that the increase in \rho_{c} is directly related to the increase in \gamma. Actually, if all of the increase in \rho_{c} at just above T_{c} is assumed to come from the reduction in _t__{\perp}, t_{\perp}^{\rm pure}/I_{c}^{\rm Co} \cong\rho_{c}^{\rm Co}(T_{c}^{\rm Co})\rho_{c}^{\rm pure}(T_{c}^{\rm pure}) \cong 4.6, we can well explain the increase in \gamma, (\gamma^{\circ}/^{\circ}/^{\circ})\cong 4.8, within the simple LD model framework. However, this assumption imposes strong temperature dependence on _t__{\perp} as seen in \rho_{c}(_T_). Since _t__{\perp} , which is determined by the tunneling barrier height and width, does not, in general, strongly depend on temperature, the strong temperature dependence would arise from the dynamical effect.

There are some models attempting to explain "semiconductive" behavior of \rho_{c} with temperature independent t_{\perp}.[16, 17] For example, Ioffe _et al._ have proposed that, in the extreme 2D system, the suppression of the N0 caused by the superconductive fluctuation effect leads to an increase in \rho_{c}.[17] According to the theory, the density of states fluctuation contribution \sigma_{\rm DS}^{\rm n(2D)} to the out-of-plane conductivity is expressed in a wide range of temperatures (t_{\perp}^{2}/T_{c} \leq T - T < \approxT_{c}) as \sigma_{\rm DS}^{\rm n(2D)}\propto - ln[T_{c}/(T - T_{c})]. Other superconductive fluctuation contributions (AL or Maki-Thompson type) can be neglected except for around temperatures in the very vicinity of T_{c} (T_{c} \leq T \leq t_{\perp}^{2}/T_{c}) when the system is extreme 2D (t_{\perp} \ll 1). We analyzed our experimental data on \rho_{c} in Fig. 4 using the above functional form of \sigma_{\rm DS}^{\rm n(2D)} to test the theory. In the analysis, out-of-plane resistivity, when there are no superconductive fluctuation effects, \rho_{c0}, was simply assumed to be a linear extrapolation of the \rho_{c} at high temperatures. The \rho_{c} of the pure sample was approximately reproduced as in Ref. [18], while the fitting failed for that of the Co-doped one because the temperature dependence was apparently weaker than the theoretical prediction. Thus, at least, all of the increase in \rho_{c} near T_{c} cannot be attributed to the standard superconductive fluctuation effect,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} Sample & Pure (x = 0) & Co 4\% doped (x = 0.04) \\ T_{c0} (K) & 88.5 & 67 \\ \Delta C (mJ K^{- 1} cm^{- 3}) & 11 & 5 \\ \mathcal{C} factor & 0.3 & 0.8 \\ \xi_{ab} (Å) & 10.0 & 13.0 \\ \xi_{c} (Å) & \approx 0.1 &  in which the value of 2D/_k_B_T_c holds constant. Consequently, it seems that there is no hope to explain our impurity effect on g and r_{c} without recourse to temperature dependent _t__{\perp}.

A promising idea is that the _t__{\perp} effectively becomes small as temperature is reduced to T_{c} due to in-plane charge dynamics (e.g., spin gap) in the strongly correlated 2D system.[4] We must remember, however, that the samples examined here are in the overdoped region. Therefore, the simple "spin gap scenario" cannot be applied to this Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system. The non-Fermi liquid nature may govern the system in a wide range of hole doping levels. Another interesting point is that the anisotropy seems to be "frozen" at T_{c}. Although our anisotropy measurements cannot go far inside the T_{c}, (_T_ - T_{c})\leq5 K, g seems unchanged below T_{c}. Some other measurements (e.g., the London penetration depth \lambda_{L})[19] also support this idea. In any case, we would like to emphasize that we must take into account the temperature dependence of _t__{\perp} in the normal state to explain the anisotropy change in the superconducting state caused by the Co doping.

There are two conceivable reasons for the impurity-induced reduction of the _t__{\perp}. One is the decrease in the hole doping level due to the trivalent Co substitution for Cu. This accounts for the overall increase (decrease) in the r_{c}(_t__{\perp}) in the measured temperature region. However, this does not explain all the observed increase in g, if T_{c} is assumed to be unchanged. The other originates from the decrease in T_{c} with impurity doping. As the temperature dependence is very strong around T_{c}, the r_{c}(_t__{\perp}) just above T_{c} further increased (decreased), accounting for the observed increase in g.

In conclusion, single crystals of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} (_x_ = 0,0.04) were grown by the TSFZ method and their anisotropic transport properties (r_{a},_r__c_, in-plane resistive transition under the magnetic field, and in-plane resistivity as a function of the magnetic field direction) were examined in the slightly overdoped region. With Co doping, an increase in the anisotropic coherence length ratio \gamma = _x__ab_/_k_c as well as an increase in r_{c} were observed, while, primarily, constant residual resistivity was added to r_{a}. We have confirmed the electronic 2D nature (incoherent interlayer charge transport) of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system, because the results follow the 2D Lawrence-Doniach model quantitatively when the interlayer coupling _t__{\perp} is defined at just above T_{c}. The analysis also showed that the origin of the "semiconductive" r_{c} lay in the temperature dependence of _t__{\perp}, which would restrict the model for the interlayer charge transport in the high-_T__c_ cuprates.

One of the authors (T.W.) would like to thank Dr. K. Semba for helping with the analysis of the resistive transition curve and the measurement of r_{a} as a function of magnetic field direction.

###### Abstract

We report on the effect of Co impurity substitution on the anisotropic transport properties of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} single crystals. With Co doping, there is an increase in anisotropy \gamma estimated from the scaling of the angular dependence of the in-plane resistivity with reduced field as well as in the out-of-plane resistivity. These results can be quantitatively explained by the two-dimensional Lawrence-Doniach model, if we assume that the anisotropy in the superconducting state is determined by the interlayer coupling just above T_{c}. The analysis highlights the specific feature in high-T_{c} cuprates that the effective interlayer coupling depends on temperature. [S0163-1829(96)50234-1]

The highly anomalous transport[1] and optical[2] properties on the interlayer charge dynamics are key issues in high-T_{c} superconductivity.[3; 4] However, whether or not the interlayer charge transport is inherently incoherent is still an open question. Furthermore, although many models have been proposed to explain "'semiconductive" out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c}, which is usually observed in the underdoped cuprates, there is no consensus as yet.[5]

We have previously shown that the impurity effect on the anisotropic transport properties is a sensitive probe for investigating the interlayer charge dynamics.[6; 7] This approach is based on the idea that the impurity averages one-electron state according to its dimensionality. If the system is anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) (coherent in the interlayer charge transport), a reduction of the anisotropy can be expected through the averaging of the gap functions \Delta since coherence length \xi^{\alpha}\hbar v_{F}/\Delta from the clean limit BCS. Indeed, we have observed such impurity-induced reduction of the anisotropy ratio \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}, where \xi_{ab} is the in-plane and \xi_{c} the out-of-plane coherence length, as well as an increase in \rho_{c} due to the impurity scattering in fully oxidized Ba_{2}Y(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta}[6]. On the other hand, if the system is strictly 2D with almost no dispersion along the c axis (incoherent in the interlayer charge transport), the impurity causes averaging of only in-plane states and the system obeys the Lawrence-Doniach (LD) description.[8] As a result, in general, no change in the anisotropy or in the magnitude of \rho_{c} can be expected. These arguments are valid even when the superconductivity is non-s wave because they are derived only from the nature of the one-electron state, while \xi's themselves will increase due to the impurity pair breaking effect in the case of d-wave superconductivity.

In this paper, we investigate the impurity effect on the superconducting coherence length \xi and the normal-state transport properties \rho_{a},\rho_{c} of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} single crystals, focusing on the interlayer charge dynamics. The obtained anisotropic parameter value, \gamma=\xi_{ab}/\xi_{c}=(m_{c}/m_{ab})^{1/2}, and \rho_{c} increased with Co doping. These results were analyzed using the LD model. Based on this analysis, we discuss the mechanism causing "'semiconductive" \rho_{c}. Here, to estimate anisotropy in the superconducting state, we first measured the in-plane resistive transition under various magnetic fields (**B||c**). Data were analyzed using the superconducting-fluctuation-renormalized Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory (Ikeda _et al._),[9] which has succeeded in explaining the characteristic broadening phenomena of the resistive transition. For more accurate estimation of \gamma, we then measured the in-plane resistivity \rho_{a} as a function of the magnetic field direction in the reversible regime. Scaling rules developed for strong type II superconductors (Blatter _et al._),[10] were used for the analysis.

Single crystals were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method. TSFZ has a fundamental advantage that homogeneous impurity doping is possible. The single crystals were annealed in air at 600 degC for 24 h \sim 36 h, then rapidly cooled in air or slowly cooled under equilibrium oxygen pressures, which were controlled by oxygen and argon flow ratio, at each temperature. The latter process ensured both uniform oxygen content and minimum disorder in the crystals, which were used for the measurement of field direction dependence for the \rho_{a} as well as for the \rho_{c} measurement. We measured \rho_{a} with the standard four-probe method, while \rho_{c} was measured with a four-probe-like method with the voltage contacts attached to the center of the ab plane and the current contacts covering almost all of the remaining space.[11]

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivities \rho_{a} for pure and Co 4% doped single-crystal Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta}. The room-temperature value of \rho_{a} for pure sample is typically \approx 250 \mu\Omega cm. The temperature dependence is nearly linear, but contains a small quadratic component, suggesting the samples are in the overdoped region. Impurity (Co) doping to 4% primarily caused large (\approx 160 \mu\Omega cm) residual resistivity, which was estimated from the intercept of \rho_{a0}, the bare in-plane resistivity, where the effect of the superconductive fluctuation is eliminated, as shown below. It also caused a slight increase in the slope of d\rho_{a}/dT from \approx0.83 \mu\Omega cm/K for the pure sample to \approx1.2 \mu\Omega cm/K for the doped one, implying the carrier concentration decreased slightly due to the trivalent Co substitution for Cu. However, the samples are overdoped even when Co is doped because tentative reductions in the oxygen content of these samples raised their T_{c}.

  Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show, respectively, the in-plane resistive transition under the various magnetic fields {\bf B}(\parallel c) for the pure and Co 4% doped single-crystal Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta}. Theoretical fits plotted according to the fluctuation-renormalized GL theory [9] are also shown. In both sets of experimental data, there are large decreases in the \rho_{a} , probably due to the superconductive fluctuation, from far (20-30 K) above T_{c} and typical tailing behavior at low temperatures in the magnetic fields. These are caused by the fluctuation enhanced by the short coherence length, high T_{c} , electronic two-dimensionality, and the one-dimensionalization of the fluctuation under a high magnetic field. In the analysis, the \rho_{a0} was assumed to be a linear extrapolation of the resistivity at higher temperatures. Here, when there was no magnetic field, the well-known Aslamasov-Larkin (AL) type description for the fluctuation was assumed. [9] The analysis was done concentrating on the high-field data, because the model was justified in the high-field limit. The fitting reproduces well the characteristic features of the data, although it was not complete. The fact that the resistivity at low temperatures is smaller than that predicted by the theory suggests that a vortex motion begins to play some role in the dissipation. Although the theoretical formula used (AL fluctuation) is derived assuming conventional (s-wave) superconductivity, it is expected to be valid with possible changes in the numerical factors in the case of d-wave superconductivity, since it is based on the one-component GL theory. Actually, the reasonable fit results here for Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} and for Ba_{2}Y(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{7-\delta} (Ref. 6) imply that the description based on one-component GL theory may not need much modification even in the case of d-wave superconductivity.

The obtained parameters, i.e., the mean field critical temperature T_{c0}, specific-heat jump \Delta C, the phenomenological C factor, which adjusts the magnitude of the fluctuation effect, \xi_{ab} , and \xi_{c} are listed in Table I. The T_{c0} is slightly higher than the observed temperatures at zero resistivity with no magnetic field, suggesting the occurrence for Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) like transition reflecting the two-dimensionality of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} system. [12] The \Delta C values agree with the reported values [13] obtained by direct measurement. The C factors are smaller than 1, implying that the effect of the superconducting fluctuation is enhanced for some unknown reasons. A reasonable \xi_{ab} value for the pure sample is obtained. With Co doping, the \xi_{ab} value increased, probably due to the reduction of the gap \Delta, since \xi\propto\hbar\upsilon_{F}/\Delta. The very small (0.1 A) \xi_{c} in each system well reproduced the data, but the theoretical curve became insensitive for further reduction of \xi_{c} . Thus, the extreme anisotropy in the superconducting state for the pure Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system was found to be maintained upon Co doping. However, precise estimation of the change in the anisotropy is impossible from only the present analysis.

Next, \rho_{a} was measured as a function of the angle \theta (-15^{\circ}<\theta<5^{\circ}) between the a axis and the magnetic field {\bf B} ({\bf B} lies in the ac plane) in the reversible region [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. Blatter _et al._ have shown [9] that the angle-dependent values of \rho_{a} under various constant fields {\bf B} at a fixed temperature are scaled on one curve against the reduced field B_{\rm red}=B(sin^{2}\theta+\gamma^{-2}cos^{2}\theta) [12]. Because this scaling rule is based on GL or London equations assuming only a strong type II superconductor, it is widely accepted to be valid for high-T_{c} cuprates [14] and is used to estimate anisotropic parameter \gamma. This way of obtaining \gamma has an advantage of higher accuracy, even in an extremely anisotropic case such as the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system, than the analysis of temperature dependence for the resistive superconducting-transition described above. The experimen

The solid curves are the theoretical fits with the parameters listed in Table I. The \rho_{a0} represents the in-plane resistivity when superconductive fluctuation effects were absent.

  tal data in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) indicate sharpening near the parallel field (\theta = 0deg) as Co is doped, implying an increase in anisotropy. In some thicker samples, we have observed a double minimum near the parallel field, which was probably caused by the slightly misaligned domain structure. To avoid such an artifact, we carefully cleaved samples to \approx 0.01 mm thickness before the transport measurements. The scaling of \rho_{a} as a function of the reduced field _B_red gives \gamma = 100 \pm 10 and = 220 \pm 10 for the pure and Co 4% doped sample, respectively. Consequently, we did not observe any impurity-induced reduction of the anisotropy, which was expected in anisotropic 3D systems. Instead, we observed an increase in anisotropy \gamma = \xi_{ab}/\xi_{c} in the superconducting state. According to the 2D LD model (Josephson-coupled superconductivity).8\xi_{c} = \xi_{ab}(_m__ab_/_m__c_)1/2deg \xi_{ab}/1deg, where _t__{\perp} is the interlayer coupling constant. Thus, the observed impurity induced increase in anisotropy by 2.2 times that of the pure sample means the decrease in _t__{\perp} by (2.2) ^{- 2}\approx 0.21 times that of the pure sample.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of out-of-plane resistivity \rho_{c} for pure and Co 4% doped single-crystal Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta}. The two \rho_{c} curves for Co-doped samples show typical sample dependence for \rho_{c} measurement. Our early data on \rho_{c} for the Co-doped sample was scattered from sample to sample. Since the out-of-plane properties are very sensitive to the oxygen content, this is considered to be caused by an oxygen inhomogeneity in the sample during cooling. To eliminate the ambiguity in the oxygen content, we improved the annealing process; the equilibrium oxygen pressures are maintained down to sufficiently low temperature (\approx300 degC). Thus we obtained reliable data on \rho_{c} for the Co-doped samples, as shown in Fig. 4.

Because all the values of \rho_{c} far exceed Mott's limit (\approx 10^{- 2}\Omegacm),[15] the out-of-plane conduction can be considered as a tunneling mechanism, \rho_{c} \propto(N_{0}_t_{\perp}_)^{- 1}, where N0 is the in-plane density of states. The observed impurity induced change in \rho_{c} could then be attributed to the change in the _t__{\perp} or the N0. It is natural to consider that the increase in \rho_{c} is directly related to the increase in \gamma. Actually, if all of the increase in \rho_{c} at just above T_{c} is assumed to come from the reduction in _t__{\perp}, t_{\perp}^{\rm pure}/I_{c}^{\rm Co} \cong\rho_{c}^{\rm Co}(T_{c}^{\rm Co})\rho_{c}^{\rm pure}(T_{c}^{\rm pure}) \cong 4.6, we can well explain the increase in \gamma, (\gamma^{\circ}/^{\circ}/^{\circ})\cong 4.8, within the simple LD model framework. However, this assumption imposes strong temperature dependence on _t__{\perp} as seen in \rho_{c}(_T_). Since _t__{\perp} , which is determined by the tunneling barrier height and width, does not, in general, strongly depend on temperature, the strong temperature dependence would arise from the dynamical effect.

There are some models attempting to explain "semiconductive" behavior of \rho_{c} with temperature independent t_{\perp}.[16, 17] For example, Ioffe _et al._ have proposed that, in the extreme 2D system, the suppression of the N0 caused by the superconductive fluctuation effect leads to an increase in \rho_{c}.[17] According to the theory, the density of states fluctuation contribution \sigma_{\rm DS}^{\rm n(2D)} to the out-of-plane conductivity is expressed in a wide range of temperatures (t_{\perp}^{2}/T_{c} \leq T - T < \approxT_{c}) as \sigma_{\rm DS}^{\rm n(2D)}\propto - ln[T_{c}/(T - T_{c})]. Other superconductive fluctuation contributions (AL or Maki-Thompson type) can be neglected except for around temperatures in the very vicinity of T_{c} (T_{c} \leq T \leq t_{\perp}^{2}/T_{c}) when the system is extreme 2D (t_{\perp} \ll 1). We analyzed our experimental data on \rho_{c} in Fig. 4 using the above functional form of \sigma_{\rm DS}^{\rm n(2D)} to test the theory. In the analysis, out-of-plane resistivity, when there are no superconductive fluctuation effects, \rho_{c0}, was simply assumed to be a linear extrapolation of the \rho_{c} at high temperatures. The \rho_{c} of the pure sample was approximately reproduced as in Ref. [18], while the fitting failed for that of the Co-doped one because the temperature dependence was apparently weaker than the theoretical prediction. Thus, at least, all of the increase in \rho_{c} near T_{c} cannot be attributed to the standard superconductive fluctuation effect,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} Sample & Pure (x = 0) & Co 4\% doped (x = 0.04) \\ T_{c0} (K) & 88.5 & 67 \\ \Delta C (mJ K^{- 1} cm^{- 3}) & 11 & 5 \\ \mathcal{C} factor & 0.3 & 0.8 \\ \xi_{ab} (Å) & 10.0 & 13.0 \\ \xi_{c} (Å) & \approx 0.1 &  in which the value of 2D/_k_B_T_c holds constant. Consequently, it seems that there is no hope to explain our impurity effect on g and r_{c} without recourse to temperature dependent _t__{\perp}.

A promising idea is that the _t__{\perp} effectively becomes small as temperature is reduced to T_{c} due to in-plane charge dynamics (e.g., spin gap) in the strongly correlated 2D system.[4] We must remember, however, that the samples examined here are in the overdoped region. Therefore, the simple "spin gap scenario" cannot be applied to this Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system. The non-Fermi liquid nature may govern the system in a wide range of hole doping levels. Another interesting point is that the anisotropy seems to be "frozen" at T_{c}. Although our anisotropy measurements cannot go far inside the T_{c}, (_T_ - T_{c})\leq5 K, g seems unchanged below T_{c}. Some other measurements (e.g., the London penetration depth \lambda_{L})[19] also support this idea. In any case, we would like to emphasize that we must take into account the temperature dependence of _t__{\perp} in the normal state to explain the anisotropy change in the superconducting state caused by the Co doping.

There are two conceivable reasons for the impurity-induced reduction of the _t__{\perp}. One is the decrease in the hole doping level due to the trivalent Co substitution for Cu. This accounts for the overall increase (decrease) in the r_{c}(_t__{\perp}) in the measured temperature region. However, this does not explain all the observed increase in g, if T_{c} is assumed to be unchanged. The other originates from the decrease in T_{c} with impurity doping. As the temperature dependence is very strong around T_{c}, the r_{c}(_t__{\perp}) just above T_{c} further increased (decreased), accounting for the observed increase in g.

In conclusion, single crystals of Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca(Cu_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}O_{8+\delta} (_x_ = 0,0.04) were grown by the TSFZ method and their anisotropic transport properties (r_{a},_r__c_, in-plane resistive transition under the magnetic field, and in-plane resistivity as a function of the magnetic field direction) were examined in the slightly overdoped region. With Co doping, an increase in the anisotropic coherence length ratio \gamma = _x__ab_/_k_c as well as an increase in r_{c} were observed, while, primarily, constant residual resistivity was added to r_{a}. We have confirmed the electronic 2D nature (incoherent interlayer charge transport) of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system, because the results follow the 2D Lawrence-Doniach model quantitatively when the interlayer coupling _t__{\perp} is defined at just above T_{c}. The analysis also showed that the origin of the "semiconductive" r_{c} lay in the temperature dependence of _t__{\perp}, which would restrict the model for the interlayer charge transport in the high-_T__c_ cuprates.

One of the authors (T.W.) would like to thank Dr. K. Semba for helping with the analysis of the resistive transition curve and the measurement of r_{a} as a function of magnetic field direction.
