###### Abstract

A new determination of the isotope effect in \gamma-stabilized uranium-molybdenum alloys has been made. We find T_{_{c}}\propto M^{-0.40}, rather than the previously reported T_{_{c}}\propto M^{-0.53}.

Subsequent to the report[1] by Hill _et al._ on the isotope effect in superconducting \gamma-uranium alloys, we obtained some more pure ^{288}U and ^{285}U, and also some ^{288}U and ^{283}U. The ^{285}U metal was purified by successive ether extractions of its nitrate. The ^{283}U was not further purified.

The stabilized \gamma-uranium phase was made by arc melting each uranium sample together with molybdenum to form the 18-at.%-Mo alloy.[1, 2] Alloys prepared from five batches each of ^{285}U and ^{286}U, and two batches of ^{286}U, were annealed for 16 h at 900 ^{\circ}C, _in vacuo_, then quenched into liquid argon, wherein they were stored until placed in a cryostat for measurement. The superconducting transition temperatures of these samples were determined in a resonant-bridge detector[3] at 30 kHz, and were taken as at the "onset" of superconductivity. The transitions were all 0.002-0.003 K in width. A ln-ln plot of the T_{_{c}} values vs the corresponding values of M (Fig. 1), with a straight line fitted to the 12 points by the method of least squares, showed that T_{_{c}}\propto M^{-0.40\pm 0.01}.

Transition-temperature measurements similarly made on some samples of the \gamma-phase alloy, which were prepared from some of the old less-pure ^{285}U and ^{286}U and then subjected to the new heat treatment, now showed T_{_{c}}\propto M^{-0.43}, in reasonably close agreement with the above results.

The difference between the results obtained in this work and those of the earlier work is, perhaps, due to the uniform heat treatment given to the samples, as well as to their greater purity. The linearity of the ln-ln plot of data for the three isotopes supports the validity of the result.

A point is shown in Fig. 1 for ^{283}U. This isotope emits \alpha particles of average energy 4.808 MeV, with a relatively short half-life (compared to the half-lives of ^{285}U, ^{286}U, and ^{288}U) of 1.62 \times 10^{5} years. Because of probable apparatus contamination by this relatively great radioactivity, the ^{283}U-Mo alloys were not heat treated, but their transition temperatures were measured on the as-arc-melted samples. Furthermore, the self-heat-ing due to the radioactivity causes a temperature difference between sample and thermometer. We determined the magnitude of this temperature difference by _in situ_ heating of a ^{280}U-Mo alloy and measurement of the resultant apparent lowering of T_{_{c}}. This was done by doping the ^{286}U-Mo alloy with 0.04 wt% of ^{282}U (which emits \alpha particles of aver-age energy 5.299 MeV, with a half-life of 73.6 years), enough to duplicate the self-heating in ^{283}U, but too little to cause an appreciable isotopic shift in T_{_{c}}. In two such ^{283}U-doped ^{280}U-Mo alloys an average apparent lowering in T_{_{c}} of 0.055 K was found. This value, when applied as a positive correction to the observed transition temperatures of four ^{283}U-Mo alloys made from two batches of ^{283}U, gave an average value for T_{_{c}} of 2.134 K. Since the two ^{280}U metal batches were considerably different from each other in purity, since both batches were less pure than the other isotopes, and since the samples were not heat treated, their transitions were 0.008-0.028-K wide, with the transition temperatures deviating from their mean value to a considerable extent. These temperatures plus the correction were therefore not included in the least-squares calculation previously mentioned. However, we believe that since the value 2.134 K lies very nearly on the extrapolation of the straight line derived from the other isotopic values of T_{e} it provides an additional confirmation of the results.

It may be remarked that the theory of Morel and Anderson4 predicts an isotope effect of T_{e}\varpropto M^{-0.42} for \gamma-U if the Debye temperature used by Goodman _et al._5 is used in the calculation.

The authors are very grateful to Dr. James E. Rounsville, Jr. of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for providing us with the ^{232}U, and for making the solid solutions of it and ^{238}U. They also wish to express their appreciation to Dr. Richard Bard, Group Leader of CMB-8 of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, for putting uranium purification and metal producing facilities of his group at our disposal.
