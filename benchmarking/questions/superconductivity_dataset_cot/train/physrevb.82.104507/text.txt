###### Abstract

A detailed study of the structure-property relationship is reported for the first four members of the high-\(T_{\rm c}\) superconducting homologous series of (Cu,Mo)Sr2(Ce,Y),Cu2O5+2s+d [(Cu,Mo)-12s2]. In this series, the adjacent CuO2 planes are separated by a single Y-cation layer for \(s\) = 1 and a fluorite-type (Ce,Y)-[O2(Ce,Y)]k,1 layer block for \(s\) = 2. Even though this series may be considered a conventional homologous series from the chemical point of view, we emphasize that the structures are different from those of the Tl-, Hg-, Bi-, etc.,-based series by the fact that the inserted fluorite-type blocks are insulating. We show the formation of the higher \(s\) members via intercalation of additional Ce-O2 layer(s) into the crystal lattices of the lower members of the series. Neutron powder-diffraction data demonstrate that the Ce/Y ratio is not constant at the different (Ce,Y) layers in the fluorite-structured block and that the innermost (Ce,Y) layer(s) are significantly Ce rich compared with the outer ones. Two independent crystallographic sites are identified for the extra oxygen atoms in the basal (Cu0.25Mo0.25O)1+d plane with site fractional occupancies that strongly correlate with the properties of the material. A short-range ordered structure is proposed for the (Cu0.75Mo0.25)O1+d layers that could explain both the superconducting properties of the materials and the enhanced \(T_{\rm c}\) for the first member of the series.

## 1 Introduction

Multilayered transition-metal oxides have, for the last two decades, been extensively investigated for their ability to host a wide variety of functional properties, such as high-\(T_{\rm c}\) superconductivity (\(T_{\rm c}\) = critical superconductivity transition temperature), thermoelectricity, oxide-ionic conductivity, and high-performance magnetoresistance, etc. From the viewpoint of materials development, "layer-engineering" has proven to be a particularly successful concept for the design of many new homologous series. Most impressively, within the field of high-\(T_{\rm c}\) cuprate superconductors, the huge variety of the presently known phases can be universally categorized as members of just two basic homologous families, namely, \(M_{\it m}A_{2}Q_{\it m}\)-1Cu2O\({}_{\it m}\)+2s2+d [or \(M\)-\(m2(n\)-1)n] and \(M_{\it m}A_{2}B_{\it m}\)-2s2], where \(M\) = Cu, Bi, Pb, Tl, Hg, etc.; \(A\) = Ba, Sr, La; \(Q\) = Ca, rare-earth (_R_) element; and \(B\) = (Ce,_R_).1 Thus, each homologous family may serve as a platform for the next-stage design of new materials that can be fabricated by the simple addition or removal of one or more atomic layers into or out of already known structures or by the partial replacement of some constituent layers by other layers with different chemical compositions.

To this date, more than 20 independent homologous series of the _M-m_2(_n_-1)_n_ type have been established (i.e., at least three members of a series have experimentally been isolated). The _M-m_2(_n_-1)_n_ family is by far more common than _M-m_2\(s\)2. In this family, the members of one series vary by the layer number (_n_) of consecutively stacked CuO2 planes in the superconductive CuO2-(_Q_-CuO2)_n_-1 block. Homologous series Bi-22(_n_-1)_n_ (Refs. 2 and 3) was the first of this type but it was immediately followed by the \(T_{\rm c}\) record breaking Tl-22(_n_-1)_n_, Tl-12(_n_-1)_n_, and Hg-12(_n_-1)_n_ series.4-10 Interestingly, all the presently known _M-m_2(_n_-1)_n_ homologous series achieve a maximum \(T_{\rm c}\) for \(n\) = 3 followed by slowly decreasing \(T_{\rm c}\) values when \(n\) exceeds 3.3 However, one may argue that the higher \(n\) members of the series may not necessarily be optimized with respect to proper hole-doping levels and accordingly the comparison with the lower \(n\) members may not be completely meaningful. As for the formation mechanism of the _M-m_2(_n_-1)_n_ phases, it is reasonable to anticipate that the higher \(n\) members form by the intercalation of additional CuO2-_Q_ layer units (i.e., nominally neutral layers where \(Q\) is a divalent cation) into the lower _n_-member structures.

In the _M-m_2\(s\)2 family, the members in a series differ from each other by the number (_s_) of the \(B\) cation, i.e., the (Ce,_R_) layers in the fluorite-structured (Ce,_R_)-[O2-(Ce,_R_)]k,1 block located between two adjacent CuO2 planes.1 Several series have been reported, e.g., (Pb,Cu)-32\(s\)2,11,12 (Fe,Cu)-12\(s\)2,13 (Co-12\(s\)2,14  Ru-12s2,15-17  and (Hg,W)-12s2 (Refs. 18 and 19) but, to this date, most members of such series were not fully or properly characterized. The increasing thickness of the (Ce,_R_)-[O2-(Ce,_R_)]s,1 block, as \(s\) increases beyond 2, makes it progressively more difficult to obtain high-quality superconducting samples. Nonetheless, we recently succeeded in synthesizing high-quality single-phase samples for the first four members of the (Cu0.75Mo0.25)Sr2(Ce,Y)Cu2O5+2s+d series [(Cu,Mo)-12\(s\)2] and in inducing superconductivity in all the samples by postsynthesis high-pressure oxygen annealing.20 In this paper, we report detailed crystal structures for the four phases  as determined by neutron powder diffraction (NPD). We discuss the phase formation mechanism and the evolution of the crystal and chemical surroundings around the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes and within the basal (Cu,Mo)O\({}_{1+\delta}\) planes upon increasing \(s\).

## II Experimental details

### Materials synthesis

Samples of the first four (Cu,Mo)-12\(s\)2 members, i.e., (Cu\({}_{0.75}\)Mo\({}_{0.25}\))Sr\({}_{2}\)YCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7+\delta}\) (_s_=1), (Cu\({}_{0.75}\)Mo\({}_{0.25}\))Sr\({}_{2}\)(Ce\({}_{1/2}\)Y\({}_{1/2}\))\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{9+\delta}\) (_s_=2), (Cu\({}_{0.75}\)Mo\({}_{0.25}\))Sr\({}_{2}\)(Ce\({}_{2/3}\)Y\({}_{1/3}\))\({}_{3}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{11+\delta}\) (_s_=3), and (Cu\({}_{0.75}\)Mo\({}_{0.25}\))Sr\({}_{2}\)(Ce\({}_{3/4}\)Y\({}_{1/4}\))\({}_{4}\)Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{13+\delta}\) (_s_=4) were synthesized using homogeneous nitrate precursors prepared from appropriate amounts of CuO, MoO\({}_{3}\), SrCO\({}_{3}\), CeO\({}_{2}\), and Y\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) powders. Detailed synthesis procedures can be found elsewhere.[20] Briefly, the starting powders were dissolved in an aqueous solution of 2\(M\) HNO\({}_{3}\) and 0.1\(M\) H\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{2}\). Evaporation of the solvent at ~100 \({}^{\circ}\)C resulted in a black solid nitrate residue which was then decomposed and calcined through subsequent short-time annealing periods at 220, 450, 650, 850, and 900 \({}^{\circ}\)C with intermediate grindings. The final firing was performed in air in several steps, for _s_=1 at 930-960 \({}^{\circ}\)C (for a total of 72 h), for _s_=2 at 950-1005 \({}^{\circ}\)C (120 h), for _s_=3 at 950-1005 \({}^{\circ}\)C (168 h), and for _s_=4 at 950-985 \({}^{\circ}\)C (264 h).

### High-pressure oxygenation

In order to render them superconducting, the as-synthesized (AS) samples were high-pressure oxygenated (HPO) in a cubic-anvil-type high-pressure cell at 5 GPa and 500 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 30 min in the presence of 33 mol % KClO\({}_{3}\). Under high pressure, KClO\({}_{3}\) decomposes to KCl and oxygen and acts as an efficient extra-oxygen source. Prior to arriving at this "critical" value, many high-pressure experiments were performed in which we observe that _T_\({}_{c}\) gradually increases to 87 K (for _s_=1) or to 54-56 K (for _s_=2-4) as we gradually increase the amount of KClO\({}_{3}\) to 33 mol %. For larger amounts of KClO\({}_{3}\) all four members of the series started to decompose. Thus, we conclude that our HPO samples have either reached their optimal-doping level or were on the verge to becoming optimally doped but not overdoped. More experiments may be needed to fine tune and pinpoint the exact amount of KClO\({}_{3}\) needed to optimally dope every member of the series. Characterization of the HPO samples proved the uniformity and high reproducibility of the HPO treatment.

Superconducting samples (_s_=1-3) were prepared for neutron powder-diffraction experiments by combining several high-pressure oxygenated specimens (~70 mg each) taken from the same AS sample. Unfortunately, the lengthy synthesis procedures of a sufficiently large sample suitable for NPD of the superconducting _s_=4 phase did not allow us to determine the detailed structure of the HPO _s_=4 member. Nevertheless, it was characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and magnetic-susceptibility measurements.

### Characterization of intermediate products

In order to monitor the phase formation process during synthesis, XRD data were collected at intermediate synthesis steps using a Rigaku RINT2550VK/U diffractometer equipped with a rotating Cu anode. The superconducting properties of the samples were measured for both the intermediate and the final single-phase products using a superconducting-quantum-interference device magnetometer [SQUID; Quantum Design: (magnetic property measurement system) MPMS-XL] under an applied magnetic field of 10 Oe.

### Crystal structure analysis

Room-temperature time-of-flight neutron powder-diffraction data were collected for both the AS (_s_=1-4) and the HPO (_s_=1-3) samples on the special environment powder diffractometer[21] at the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source. High-resolution backscattering data, from 0.5 to 4 A \(d\) spacing were analyzed by the Rietveld analysis method using the general structure analysis system code (GSAS).[22, 23] In the analysis, background, peak width, and extinction parameters were refined, together with the lattice parameters, atomic positions, and isotropic temperature factors.

## III Results and discussion

### Phase formation

Normal-pressure sample synthesis in air yielded all the four (Cu,Mo)-12\(s\)2 phases in a single-phase form. Optimum formation temperatures for the four phases differ very slightly. However, we found that upon increasing the number of intervening (inserted) layers, significantly longer-heat treatment periods are required to complete the synthesis. The final single-phase composition is controlled by the starting Ce/Y cationic composition of the precursor. For all the four phases, Cu, Mo, and Sr contents were kept fixed whereas the total sum of Ce and Y and their optimal Ce(_s_-1):Y\({}_{1}\) ratio increased by increasing \(s\). As such, the synthesis requirements are rather strict and all attempts to start with slightly different precursor compositions resulted in multiphase samples. Interestingly, with the optimal Ce(_s_=1):Y\({}_{1}\) ratio, the overall charge count of the (Ce,Y)-[O\({}_{2}\)-(Ce,Y)]\({}_{\perp}\) block remains constant at 3+ independent of the layer number \(s\) (assuming nominal valence states of 4+ and 3+ for Ce and Y, respectively).

In order to get further insights into the phase-formation mechanism of the higher (Cu,Mo)-12\(s\)2 members, we monitored the phase evolution of the _s_=4 member by collecting several XRD patterns at intermediate synthesis steps. The sample was progressively annealed at 950 - 985 \({}^{\circ}\)C for a total of 48, 72, 96, 120, and 264 h. A small specimen was extracted from each intermediate product which was then subjected to HPO treatment followed by structural and superconducting characterization measurements. After 48 h annealing, see Fig. 1, the synthesized product mainly consists of the _s_=3 phase with significant traces of the _s_=2 and CeO\({}_{2}\) impurity phases still present. At this stage, no signs were detected for the _s_=1 member or the targeted _s_=4 phase.

  However, as the figure also shows, the \(s\) = 4 phase gradually evolves upon subsequent firing treatments with a concomitant decrease in the fractional amounts of CeO2 and the lower \(s\) members. Magnetic-susceptibility curves for the mixed-phase intermediate products (after HPO annealing) exhibit broad or multiple transitions as displayed in Fig. 1. Only after the 264 h firing was complete, the product became essentially single-phase (Cu,Mo)-1242 with a sharp _T_c of ~56 K (after HPO annealing). Our results demonstrate the slow phase formation of the higher \(s\) members of the (Cu,Mo)-12\(s\)2 series through the diffusive intercalation of individual CeO2 layers (see structural results in subsequent paragraphs) into the (Ce,Y)-[O2-(Ce,Y)]s1 fluorite-structured blocks of the lower \(s\) members starting from the \(s\) = 2 phase rather than from the Ce-free \(s\) = 1 phase.

### Rietveld refinements and structural results

Refined crystal structure parameters for the \(s\) = 1-4 phases are listed in Table 1. In the refinements, structural models were constructed in which the designed layer repetition of SrO-(Cu,Mo)O1 +- _s_-SrO-CuO2-(Ce,Y)-[O2-(Ce,Y)]s1-CuO2 was confirmed. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, our models successfully refined using the tetragonal symmetries of the \(P\)4/_mmm_ and \(I\)4/_mmm_ space groups for the \(s\) = 1, 3 and \(s\) = 2, 4 phases, respectively. No evidence was observed to justify the use of a lower structural symmetry as in the case, for example, of fully oxygenated CuBa2YCu2O6 +- (Cu-1212).24-26 We, therefore, conclude that the extra oxygen atoms in the HPO samples may at most form random chain fragments along the \(a\) or \(b\) direction; thus, resulting in an average tetragonal structure. Similar conclusions have previously been suggested for another closely related material, Cu(Ba,La)2(La,Ca)Cu2O6 +- 27,28 In Cu(Ba,La)2(La,Ca)Cu2O6 +- \(s\) = 4) with two or CuBa2YCu2O6 +- \(s\) (i.e., before the formation of long-range ordered CuO6 chains), the randomly distributed extra oxygen atoms in the CuO6 layers are characterized by an asymmetric bonding with the surrounding cations and consequently in unusually large thermal factors indicative of disorder and significant local short-range displacements.

Initial refinements resulted in full occupancies for Cu2, O1, O2 (_s_ = 1 - 4), O3 (_s_ = 2 - 4), and O4 (_s_ = 4) within two or three standard deviations (see Table 1 for the atomic positions). The occupancies of these atoms were then kept fixed during the final refinements. No evidence for Mo substitution at the Cu2 site was observed (i.e., full Cu2 occupancies obtained with no unusual thermal factors or signs for displacements of the surrounding oxygen atoms). On the other hand, significantly large thermal factors were observed for Cu1 if Mo were not allowed to share the site. Strong structural correlations were observed when attempting to refine the individual Cu1 and Mo occupancies and the corresponding short-range displacements because of the complex local disorder associated with the Mo substitution and the lack of a significant neutron-scattering length contrast between Cu (7.718 fm) and Mo (6.715 fm). The formation of long-range Cu1/Mo order can be ruled out because of the absence of substructure peaks that otherwise should have been observed.

Strong correlations were also observed when refining the site occupancies for Ce1/Y1 (_s_ = 1 - 4) and Ce2/Y2 (_s_ = 3, 4). Interestingly, in every refinement model, the occupancy of Y2 always refined to values close to zero within 1-5 standard deviations, see Table 1. We conclude that this site is mainly occupied by Ce in agreement with the observed intercalation mechanism (described above) of the Ce-O2 double-layer block into the fluorite-structured blocks of the lower \(s\) members and the concomitant disappearance of the CeO2 impurity phase.

On the other hand, the Ce1 and Y1 site occupancies always refined to values very close to the nominal ratios; thus, giving further support to the formation of "Ce-only" layers and Ce/Y mixed layers. Our refinement results suggest the random distribution of Ce and Y at the mixed Ce/Y site again with no evidence detected for any long-range cationic ordering.

As for the (Cu,Mo)O1 +- \(s\) layer, the proposed structures offer several possible sites for extra oxygen atoms at (\(\frac{1}{2}\)\(\frac{1}

### Bond lengths and bond valence sums

With increasing the number \(s\) of the cation layers in the (Ce, Y)-[O2-(Ce, Y)]\({}_{\text{-}1}\) block, both the \(c\) axis and the interatomic distance \(d_{\text{(Cu}_{\text{0.7}}\text{Cu}_{\text{2.0}})}\) (through this block) increase linearly. The \(a\)-axis parameter, on the other hand, remains nearly unchanged, Fig. 5. The HPO treatment results in slight lattice contractions in both the in-plane (0.1\(-\)0.3 %) and the out-of-plane (0.4\(-\)0.7 %) directions in agreement with the behavior of many other high-\(T_{\text{c}}\) superconductors, e.g., CuBa\({}_{2}\)YCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6+\delta}\) (Ref. [30]) (commonly referred to as YBCO) upon oxygenation.

Select interatomic bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. The use of these bond length values in conjunction

The Cu2 oxidation state increases sensibly to 2.45+ and 2.32\(-\)2.34+ for the HPO \(s = 1\) and \(s = 2\), 3 samples, respectively (see Table 2). For the superconducting \(s = 1\) sample, it is important to note the agreement between its high \(T_{\rm c}\) (Table 2) and its average Cu2 oxidation state and the previously reported XANES results.[29] It is also worth noting the difference in Cu2 oxidation state before and after high-pressure annealing [\(\sim 0.24\)+ (\(s = 1\)) and \(\sim 0.1-0.12\)\((s = 2,3)\)] again in agreement with the XANES results.[29] In this work, \(r_{o}\) values of 2.019, 2.116, 2.074, 1.655, and 1.735 determined from similarly complex oxide structures were used for Y3+, Ce3+, Ce4+, Cu2+, and Cu3+, respectively.[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37] The average oxidation state for Cu2 in the CuO2 layers was calculated according to the method described in Ref. 27.

As expected, the length of the Cu2-(Ce,Y)-[O2-(Ce,Y)]k1-Cu2 fluorite-structured block increases linearly from \(\sim\)3 to 12 A upon increasing the layer number \(s\) but the average block thickness normalized to only one (Ce,Y) layer [i.e., (Cu2-Cu2)/\(s\)] decreases upon increasing \(s\), Fig. 5. This result suggests that the increased thickness of the insulating fluorite block would weaken the electron tunneling between the CuO2 layers (through the fluorite-type blocks); thus, reducing the three-dimensional character of the CuO2 superconducting blocks. However, we would like to point out that in this homologous series, the reservoir block SrO-(Cu,MoO)1+\(\delta\)SrO is more oxygenated than in similar cuprates as, for example, in CuBa2YCu3O7 or more appropriately in CuSr2YCu3O7. As we will see below in the HPO phases an appreciable fraction of the Cu cations are five or even six coordinated while they are only four coordinated in CuBa2YCu3O7 or in the Sr counterpart.

We observe no significant effects before and after oxygenation on the various (Ce,Y)-O bond lengths and the Ce oxidation state remains unchanged. We thus conclude that no competition exists between Ce and Cu2 with respect to attracting the extra charges introduced by oxygen doping.

On the other hand, the out-of-plane O2-Cu2-O2 buckling angle becomes significantly larger for the superconducting samples in a counterintuitive disagreement with the common belief that maximum \(T_{\rm c}\)'s are achieved when perfectly flat CuO2 planes are synthesized. Noting the similar results obtained with Cu-1212-type structures (at constant oxygen doping amounts),[28, 38] we interpret this result as evidence for a direct competition between the electronic and nuclear structures (i.e., structural instabilities and electronic density of states) of the superconducting materials. Thus, higher \(T_{\rm c}\)'s should be possible, for similar oxygen contents, if flatter CuO2 planes (less buckling) could be synthesized.

### Structural correlations with superconductivity

In order to understand the structural details in terms of their effects on superconductivity, we propose in Fig. 6 a short-range ordered model for the (Cu1,Mo)O1+\(\delta\) layers (a) before and (c) after oxygenation [corresponding tilted views are displayed in (b) and (d), respectively]. The orthorhombic arrangement in these drawings and the absence of superstructure ordering peaks in the average tetragonal structure indicate that small domains extending to at most 100 unit cells or so (\(\sim\)400 A) may exist along the \(a\) and \(b\) axes.

The significance of this model, albeit may not be unique, is that it describes well the structural results and the observed \(T_{\rm c}\) behavior across the whole series. Starting with the \(s = 1\) AS sample, the refinement gives partial oxygen occupancies of 58% of O5 (\(x\)\(y\)\(0\)) and 42% of O6 (\(\frac{1}{2}\)\(y\)\(0\)). All the Mo cations (one fourth of the total positions) are six coordinated while only a few of the Cu1 atoms have this type of coordination. The remaining Cu1 atoms are squarely coordinated just like they are in the structure of oxygenated CuBa2YCu2O6+\(\delta\)

The structure of HPO \(s = 1\) may be easier to understand. The O5 (\(x\)\(y\)\(0\)) positions disappear in favor of the more

Figure 4: (Color online) The (Cu,Mo)O1+\(\delta\) layer. Atomic positions for the extra oxygen atoms O5 (\(x\)\(y\)\(0\); green or light shade) and O6 (\(\frac{1}{2}\)\(y\)\(0\); red or dark shade) are shown. The sites are only partially occupied. Blue spheres (corners) represent Cu/Mo.

  symmetrical O6 (\(\frac{1}{2}\)\(y\)\(0\)) positions. The local structure should be orthorhombic but the domain model applies in this case as well. In this model, the O6 occupancy factor corresponds to 0.375 which is in very good agreement with the refined value of 0.39(1). All Mo are octahedrally coordinated whereas the number of six coordinated Cu1 increases to 1/3 which corresponds to \(\delta\)=0.5. The remaining 2/3 Cu1 atoms are squarely coordinated.

The occupancy of the basal plane for the \(s\)=2 AS sample is exactly the same as that of the \(s\)=1 AS sample. The occupancy of the (\(x\)\(y\)\(0\)) positions is 55% which is within one or two standard deviations from the value for the \(s\)=1 AS sample. In the case of \(s\)=2, high-pressure oxygenation increases the occupancy of the more symmetrical O6 site but the occupancy of O5 does not drop to 0 as in the case of \(s\)=1. The relative O5/O6 occupancies change from 55%/45% to 36%/64% before and after oxygenation, respectively. Some oxygen ordering takes place by oxygenation but not as well as for the \(s\)=1 sample. The case of the \(s\)=3 sample is similar with the relative O5/O6 occupancies changing from 59%/41% to 38%/62% after oxygenation. It is interesting to note that in the \(s\)=4 AS sample, all the oxygen atoms are in the O5 (\(x\)\(y\)\(0\)) positions. We tentatively explain this order

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c} Bond length & Multiplicity & \(s\)=1 (AS) & \(s\)=1 (HPO) & \(s\)=2 (AS) & \(s\)=2 (HPO) & \(s\)=3 (AS) & \(s\)=3 (HPO) & \(s\)=4 (AS) \\ \hline (Cu1,Mo)-O1 & \(\times\)2 & 1.826(4) & 1.874(18) & 1.8444(25) & 1.885(7) & 1.8369(35) & 1.869(6) & 1.809(6) \\ (Cu1,Mo)-O5 & \({}^{\rm a}\) & 1.885(18) & & 1.890(11) & 1.81(4) & 1.861(14) & 1.681(28) & 1.830(16) \\ (Cu1,Mo)-O5 & \({}^{\rm a}\) & 2.44(4) & & 2.516(15) & 2.50(6) & 2.557(19) & & 2.528(16) \\ (Cu1,Mo)-O6 & \({}^{\rm a}\) & 1.968(8) & 2.002(10) & 1.980(10) & 1.946(5) & 1.962(8) & 1.953(4) & \\ Cu2-O1 & \(\times\)1 & 2.295(4) & 2.149(20) & 2.2984(32) & 2.198(9) & 2.282(4) & 2.183(7) & 2.308(7) \\ Cu2-O2 & \(\times\)4 & 1.9  ing as due to the long time required for the synthesis of this material (a couple of weeks) which may give enough time for the oxygen atoms to settle/order around the Mo cations. Since the \(s\) = 4 HPO sample is also superconducting at 55.5 K, one could anticipate that oxygen ordering would take place at the O6 site as well.

Our structural results seem to offer an explanation as why the _T_c of 87 K for the Mo-substituted \(s\) = 1 sample is significantly higher than the _T_c's of the unsubstituted parent CuSr2YCu2O6+d material (~60 K or less),39-42 and why the higher \(s\) members of the series exhibit lower and more importantly constant _T_c's of ~55 K. The higher oxidation of the (Cu0.75Mo2.25)O1+d layer accompanied by oxygen ordering is responsible for the higher _T_c of (Cu0.75Mo2.25)Sr2YCu2O7+d. The insertion of the insulating (Ce, Y)-[O2-(Ce, Y)]i-1 blocks must drastically change the scenario that the three dimensionality of superconductivity occurs via Josephson coupling through these insulating blocks. By carefully examining the four structures presented in Fig. 2, one can see an immediate drop in dimensionality as \(s\) increases from 1 to 2 or higher. It is quite clear that the structures for the \(s\) = 2-4 members all present single superconducting blocks; i.e., CuO2-SrO-(Cu, Mo)O1+d-SrO-CuO2, separated by insulating layers of various thicknesses; thus, explaining the constant _T_c values for these members. The incomplete oxygen ordering in the \(s\) = 2 and 3 HPO samples results in lessening the effectiveness of the charge-transfer mechanism to the superconducting CuO2 planes and consequently in lowering _T_c's.

As described above, our samples are either optimally doped or very slightly underdoped. Thus, for our HPO samples, oxygen content is not the parameter responsible for the different maximal _T_c's. However, as previously demonstrated by Liu _et al._[43] and Han _et al._,44 oxygen ordering outside the CuO2 planes produces strong effects on superconductivity. Liu _et al._'s low-temperature nitrogen annealing results obtained with Sr2CuO3+d materials show significant _T_c enhancements from 75 to 89 K and 95 K that correlate with different modulated superstructures associated with oxygen-vacancy ordering at the apical oxygen sites. According to Liu _et al._, local-density approximation band calculations show that ordering of the apical oxygen atoms would significantly affect the second-nearest hopping integral _t'_ between two neighboring Cu-Cu atoms in the CuO2 planes. Furthermore, they suggest that oxygen ordering correlates with minimized cationic disorder in the CuO2 planes and within the SrO layers and results in enhanced _T_c.

With this in mind, we similarly speculate that oxygen ordering in the (Cu,Mo)O1+d-SrO-(Cu, Mo)O1+d charge-reservoir block significantly minimizes the cationic disorder that would otherwise occur at the (Cu,Mo) and Sr sites. Consequently, disorder at the apical oxygen site would also be minimized to result in enhanced charge transfer between the reservoir block and the CuO2 planes. More work is needed in which the effects of oxygen ordering on _T_c are fully investigated in samples produced to exhibit various degrees of oxygen order/disorder.

Finally, we note the familiar effects of oxygenation on the thickness of the Cu2-Cu2 blocking layer and on the apical Cu2-O1 bond length which exhibits a large contraction from ~2.3 A (AS) to ~2.15 A for the \(s\) = 1 superconducting sample, Fig. 5. A relatively smaller contraction (2.3 A to ~2.20 A) is observed for the \(s\) = 2, 3 members. On the other hand, the equatorial Cu2-O2 bond lengths remain unchanged before and after oxygenation. These results clearly indicate the important role played by the apical oxygen in facilitating the charge transfer between the (Cu,Mo)O1+d and CuO2 layers.

## IV Conclusions

We have investigated the synthesis and structural properties of the (Cu,Mo)-12\(s\)2 homologous series of cuprate high-_T_c superconductors. In this series, an insulating spacing or a blocking layer of constant total charge of +3, inserted between two adjacent superconductive CuO2 planes, can be gradually thickened from ~3 A for the single-cation Y layer in (Cu,Mo)-1212 to ~12 A for the quadruple-fluorite-layered block in (Cu,Mo)-1242. For the \(s\) = 2-4 samples, the value of _T_c is not significantly affected by the extended blocking layer but rather on the constant hole-doping level in the CuO2 planes as evidenced by neutron powder diffraction and previous XANES results. Analysis of the structures of (Cu,Mo)-12\(s\)2 reveals the presence of two independent crystallographic sites in the basal (Cu0.75Mo0.25)O1+d layer that can accommodate the extra oxygen atoms introduced by high-pressure oxygen annealing. Significant oxygen redistribution appears to take place in the HPO annealed samples with complete short-range oxygen ordering taking place in the basal layer of the \(s\) = 1 sample. On the other hand, only partial (incomplete) oxygen ordering takes place in the higher \(s\) = 2 and 3 HPO samples, which seems to explain the reduced effectiveness in charge transfer to the CuO2 superconducting layers and consequently in lowering their _T_c's. The structural and unusual superconducting behavior of this homologous series clearly demonstrate the power of layer-by-layer engineering in achieving unique on-demand designs of high-_T_c superconductors and related multilayered materials.
