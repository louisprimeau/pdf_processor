###### Abstract

Transport properties and magnetization measurements of the K\({}_{3}\)MoO\({}_{2-\delta}\) (0 \(\leq\) \(x\) \(\leq\) 0.25) compound are reported. The compound crystallizes in the oxygen deficient MoO\({}_{2}\) monoclinic structure with potassium atoms occupying interstitial positions. An unconventional metallic behavior with power-law temperature dependence is related to a magnetic ordering. Superconducting transition with small volume fraction is also observed near 7 K for a sample with low potassium composition.

## I Introduction

Interplay between superconductivity and magnetism has excited the scientific community due to the possibility to understand unconventional electron-pairing mechanisms.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] The recent discovery of the iron-based superconductors with high critical temperature [1, 6] and rich temperature-composition phase diagrams [7, 8, 5] has offered an unique opportunity for studying a possible magnetic-ordering-mediated high-temperature superconductivity.[1, 2, 3, 9] Furthermore, the existence of superconductivity in unconventional metals such as Li\({}_{0.9}\)Mo\({}_{0}\)O\({}_{17}\),[10, 11] Na\({}_{x}\)CoO\({}_{2}\),[12] and cuprates [9, 13] is still a challenge to be understood.

In all of these compounds the existence of anisotropy seems to play an important role for the appearance of superconductivity.[14, 10, 15, 16] One of the most important mechanisms for the high anisotropic conductivity was predicted by the Luttinger liquid (LL) theory.[17] In this model no discontinuity is expected in the momentum distribution at the Fermi surface.[17] Furthermore, spin-charge separation and power-law temperature (\(T\)) dependence of the correlation functions are key features of the LL physics.[17] In cuprate superconductors, possible LL behavior is controversial and remains under discussion.[18] However, in the purple bronze Li\({}_{0.9}\)Mo\({}_{0}\)O\({}_{17}\) compound the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) conductivity has been unambiguously related to the appearance of the superconducting state.[10, 14] Recently, the normal-state electrical resistance of the Li\({}_{0.9}\)Mo\({}_{0}\)O\({}_{17}\) compound has been properly described by a two-band LL with two power-law \(T\) terms.[10] Due to this power-law \(T\) dependence,[10] high anisotropic ratio in the electrical conductivity [15, 19] and thermal expansion [14] along crystallographic axes, photoemission experiments,[20] and band-structure calculations,[21] the Li\({}_{0.9}\)Mo\({}_{0}\)O\({}_{17}\) compound is nowadays recognized as the best example for the LL behavior.

Despite the excellent agreement with the LL physics provided by the Li\({}_{0.9}\)Mo\({}_{6}\)O\({}_{17}\) compound [10, 14, 20, 21] many other molybdenum phases have been considered for the study of low-dimensional behavior.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 magnetometer coupled in a PPMS or superconducting quantum interference device.

## III III Results

Table 1 shows crystallographic data used in the simulations of x-ray powder-diffraction patterns for the KxMoO2-\(\delta\) compound. Experimental and simulated x-ray diffractograms [32] for the KxMoO2-\(\delta\) compound are shown in Fig. 1. They agree each other and are very similar to that of the MoO2. [33]

Only slight displacements of diffraction peaks are observed in MoO2 potassium-doped samples. This can be clearly observed for the peaks shown in Fig. 2. The displacements to lower angles imply increasing of the lattice parameters which can be attributed to the increasing of the potassium composition in the KxMoO2-\(\delta\) compound.

Based upon the crystallographic data, the crystal lattices of both MoO2 and KxMoO2-\(\delta\) monoclinic structures were simulated. Crystalline structures are shown in Fig. 3.

MoO2 forms a distorted rutile structure having Mo-Mo metallic bonds along \(a\) axis of the monoclinic structure. [34, 35, 36] Due to those Mo-Mo bonds and other structural aspects, MoO2 is supposed to show anisotropic behavior. Structural and electronic properties of this dioxide remain under investigation. [34, 37]

For the KxMoO2-\(\delta\) compound, simulations of x-ray powder diffractograms suggest that potassium atoms occupy interstitial positions of the oxygen deficient MoO2 as indicated on the right panel of the Fig. 3. Possible interstitial Wyckoff positions are \(2a\), \(2b\), \(2c\), and \(2d\). However, the simulations suggest that the most probable position is \(2d\). Other positions are unlikely because potassium atoms would occupy interstitial positions closer to the molybdenum atoms. Furthermore, potassium atoms occupying \(2d\) sites have another importance since none of them occupy positions between Mo-Mo bonds along \(a\) axis.

Based upon starting sample compositions and atomic absorption spectroscopy, the KxMoO2-\(\delta\) compound has potassium composition between 0.05 and 0.25 and oxygen contents ranging from 1.5 to 2.0. KxMoO2-\(\delta\) compound is a new phase in the K-Mo-O system. Close compositions reported in literature are \(M\)MoO2O4 and \(M\)xMoO4O6 with \(M\) = K, Ba, Li, Na, In, and Sn. [38, 39, 40, 41] However, neither of these compounds

Figure 3: (Color online) Crystal structures of the MoO2 (left) and KxMoO2-\(\delta\) (right). Both crystal lattices are monoclinic. In the simulation for the KxMoO2-\(\delta\) compound, potassium atoms occupy \(2d\) interstitial Wyckoff positions of the oxygen deficient MoO2.

  have similar diffraction patterns nor physical properties as follow. In Fig. 4(a) is displayed the electrical resistance as a function of temperature, _R_(_T_), for the K0.14MoO1.58 sample.

The compound shows a metal-like behavior. An anomalous metallic behavior can be noticed below ~70 K in which _R_(_T_) reduces at low temperatures instead showing a typical saturation or linear \(T\) dependence as for conventional metallic conductors.[42] Similar behaviors have been found for several samples with different K compositions in the 0.05 <= \(x\) <= 0.25 range [see upper inset of the Fig. 4(a) and main panel of the Fig. 4(b)]. Near _T_S=250 K, the K0.14MoO1.58 sample displays a phase transition. Results for several samples show that this transition is very sensitive to the potassium composition. Hysteresis near 225 K in the _R_(_T_) curves for the K0.25MoO1.5 sample, shown in inset of the Fig. 4(b), suggests that the transition is a first-order phase transition. In lower inset of the Fig. 4(a) one can see the conventional linear temperature dependence for a MoO2.01 sample [43, 44] which is displayed together with the anomalous behavior of the K0.14MoO1.58. The results unambiguously demonstrate the relevance of K doping or oxygen deficiency on the appearance of the anomalous metallic behavior at low temperatures.

We have observed that a simple power law, _R_(_T_) ~ _T_a, with \(a\) = 0.53 +- 0.07 has fitted the results for several K_x_MoO2-_z_ samples with 0.05 <= \(x\) <= 0.25. The origin of this power-law temperature dependence is under investigation but could indicate a possible quasi-1D character of the K_x_MoO2-_δ_ compound despite the possible extrinsic inter-granular effects on the electrical transport. This behavior is similar to the discussion reported recently for the Li0.9Mo06O17, [10, 14] however the power-law temperature dependence for compound reported here has only one power-law term with positive \(a\) exponent [14, 18]. Furthermore, this unconventional behavior could be in agreement with the anisotopic behavior expected to the Mo-Mo channels along \(a\) axis of both MoO2 and K_x_MoO2-_δ_ compounds (see Fig. 3).

Magnetization measurements in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and FC procedures, shown in Fig. 5(a), suggest that the unconventional metallic behavior is related to a magnetic ordering below _T_M ~ 70 K. The _M_(_T_) curves in ZFC and FC for the K0.3MoO2 sample are displayed in the inset of the Fig. 5(a). No magnetic ordering is observed near the first-order phase transition. The increasing of the magnetic moment at lower temperatures and the hysteresis shown in Fig.

Figure 4: (Color online) (a) Typical resistance as function of temperature for the K_x_MoO2−_δ_ compound. An anomalous metallic behavior with decreasing _R_(_T_) can be noticed below 70 K (see upper inset). Lower inset displays a comparison between electrical behavior of MoO2 and a K-doped sample. In (b) is shown the anomalous behavior in _R_(_T_) curve for another sample. The kink near _T_S = 250 K in (a) and the hysteresis in the inset of (b) are attributed to a first-order phase transition.

Figure 5: (Color online) (a) Magnetization measurements for the K0.14MoO1.58 sample (upper curve). A magnetic ordering can be observed at _T_M ~ 70 K. The anomalous behavior of _R_(_T_) at low temperatures is unambiguously related to the magnetic ordering (lower curve). Inset shows the magnetization curves for the K0.3MoO2 sample. No signal of magnetic ordering is observed near the first-order phase transition. In (b) are shown three _m_(_H_) curves for temperatures above and below _T_M. The inset displays the magnetic hysteresis at 1.8 K.

  5(b) suggest an unusual weak ferromagnetic ordering below \(T_{M}\). We have noticed that the general magnetic and electrical behaviors of the K\({}_{x}\)MoO\({}_{2-\delta}\) samples are very similar to those reported for the Na\({}_{x}\)CoO\({}_{2}\) compound with \(x\)=0.75 and 0.82.[12, 45] The origin of the similarities is under investigation.

Finally, let us turn our discussion to the observation of superconductivity in low K-doped sample. Figure 6 displays magnetization measurements for the K\({}_{0.05}\)MoO\({}_{1.63}\) sample with rod shape in order to reduce demagnetization effects. Figure 6(a) shows the magnetization as a function of temperature in the ZFC and FC procedures. A clear superconducting transition can be observed near 6.5 K for 200 Oe. This is the highest superconducting critical temperature reported for the K-Mo-O system up to now. Only one previous report suggests superconductivity near 4.2 K in this system.[46] No drop in the resistance as a function of temperature has been observed (see inset of Fig. 6), indicating that the sample has low superconducting volume fraction.[47] Estimation of the superconducting volume fraction based upon the magnetization measurement shown in Fig. 6 gives 4% which is much lower than that expected for the percolation limit.[47, 48]

In Fig. 7(a) one can see the magnetization versus applied field measured at different temperatures below \(T_{c}\). Clear Meissner and mixed states can be noticed. Based upon the points in the \(M(H)\) curves indicated by arrows for different temperatures, one can find the \(H_{C1}\) and \(H_{C2}\) lines shown in Fig. 7(b) using the \(H_{C}\)[1\(-\)(\(T/T_{C}\))\({}^{2}\)] equation with \(i\)=1 or 2. From the fittings it is possible to estimate the critical temperature at zero-magnetic field as 7.25 K. \(H_{C1}\) and \(H_{C2}\) at zero temperature are also estimated to be 450 Oe and 802 Oe, respectively. Those values provide \(\xi(0)\)=641 A, \(\lambda(0)\) =1210 A, and \(\kappa\)=1.89, indicating that the K\({}_{x}\)MoO\({}_{2-\delta}\) compound is a type-II superconductor.[49]

## IV Conclusion

A phase in the K-Mo-O system with K\({}_{x}\)MoO\({}_{2-\delta}\) composition is reported. An anomalous metallic behavior with power-law temperature dependence has been found for several samples in 0.05 \(\leq\) \(x\) \(\leq\) 0.25 range. The anomaly with an exponent \(\alpha\)\(\sim\) 0.5 is related to a magnetic ordering below 70 K. Small superconducting volume fraction has been observed for a sample with low K doping. Correlation between the unconventional metallic behavior and the magnetic ordering below \(T_{M}\) in closely related superconducting sample is under investigation.

In inset the \(R(T)\) behavior of the sample is displayed. No drop in \(R(T)\) is observed near the diamagnetic superconducting transition. Due to the low superconducting fraction of the sample, the power-law temperature dependence remains responsible for the electrical behavior.
