###### Abstract

We have determined the oxygen content and the Cu valence by iodometric titration of single-phase HgBa2Ca_n_-1Cu_nO2(_n_+1)+_d_ (_n_=2,3), Hg-1212 and Hg-1223, superconductors postannealed under various conditions in either a reducing or an oxidizing atmosphere. Their lattice parameters, _T_c, resistivity, and the thermoelectric power have been systematically investigated as a function of Cu valence. Hg-1212 exhibits a parabolic or "bell-shaped" relationship between _T_c and the Cu valence similar to that reported for HgBa2CaO4+_d_ (Hg-1201), while only a half of the parabola is observed for Hg-1223. The systematic variations in the resistivity and the thermoelectric power as well as the relationship between _T_c and the Cu valence confirm that the Hg-1223 sample with the highest _T_c of 135 K is almost optimally doped. Both Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 as well as Hg-1201 exhibit their maximum _T_c values at the same nominal Cu valence of approximately 2.20 which is also comparable to those for other high-_T_c cuprate superconductors. This coincidence of the Cu valence for optimally doped states suggests that the simple ionic model where each excess oxygen in the Hg-O_d_ charge reservoir supplies two holes is appropriate in the present Hg-12(_n_-1)_n_ samples.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery of the Hg-based superconductors,[1, 2] their structural and physical properties have been extensively investigated. In particular, HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+_d_ (Hg-1223) phase has attracted considerable attention, because it has the highest superconducting transition temperature _T_c of 135.4 K under ambient pressure[3] and above 150 K under high pressure.[4, 5] The structure of HgBa2Ca_n_-1Cu_nO2(_n_+1)+_d_ is almost the same as that of Tl-based superconducting cuprates with a single Tl-O layer. Their structures consist of the Ca_n_-1Cu_nO2n_ block (or the infinite layer block) and the Hg-O_d_s "charge reservoir" block. It is noted that Hg in the Hg-O_d_d_ block basically has a twofold coordination with oxygen since the occupancy of oxygen at the [1/2, 1/2, 0] site in the Hg-O_d_ block is very small.[6] It has been established by neutron diffraction studies that "excess" oxygen occupying this site functions to dope holes into the CuO2 plane and thus the doping state of the Hg-based superconductors can be varied by changing the excess oxygen content.

It is of particular importance to investigate the doping state or the hole concentration and their correlation with the superconducting properties of these superconductors because it may provide insight into the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. There have been several reports on the dependence of superconducting properties of HgBa2CuO4+_d_ (Hg-1201) on the hole concentration or the excess oxygen content. Wagner _et al.[6]_ determined the excess oxygen content \(d\) of two underdoped samples with _T_c = 59 K and 95 K to be 0.11 and 0.15, respectively, by neutron diffraction experiments. They also found that approximately 0.09 oxygen atoms per formula unit is located on the [1/2, 0, 0] chain site, which is associated with the substitution of Cu for the Hg site. Since the sample with _T_c = 59 K has the oxygen occupancy of only 0.02 on the [1/2, 1/2, 0] site, the contribution of oxygen at the chain site to hole doping is strongly suggested. On the other hand, Chmaissem _et al.[7]_ found no chain site oxygen in their Hg-1201 sample. Thus the existence of chain site oxygen and its contribution to hole doping are still controversial.

Xiong _et al.[8]_ determined the oxygen content of Hg-1201 by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) combined with neutron diffraction experiments. They observed a parabolic relationship between _T_c and the excess oxygen content \(d\). However, a \(d\) value of 0.22 for the optimally doped sample was much larger than that reported by Wagner _et al._ and the value which was estimated from the actual hole concentration deduced from thermoelectric power (TEP) of their samples. Thus they suggested a significant deviation from the simple ionic model where one excess oxygen provides two holes into the CuO2 plane. On the other hand, Fukuoka _et al.[9]_ recently determined the excess oxygen content of single-phase Hg-1201 samples postannealed under various conditions by the iodometric titration method. The nominal copper valence values were calculated from the oxygen content data by assuming constant valence values of +2.00 and -2.00 for mercury and oxygen, respectively. The obtained correlation between _T_c and the Cu valence exhibits a parabolic or "bell shaped" curve with the maximum in _T_c at the Cu valence of +2.18. This Cu valence value is quite similar to those reported for other cuprate superconductors and rather supports the ionic model for the excess oxygen in the Hg-O_d_s_ block.

For the _n_=2 and 3 phases, i.e., HgBa2CaCu2O6+_d_ (Hg-1212) and Hg-1223, there have been less systematic studies on the relation between _T_c and the excess oxygen content or the hole concentration. This is primarily because of the difficulty in synthesizing single-phase samples. Morosin _et al._10 reported the relation between \(T_{c}\) and conditions of annealing with various oxygen pressures for Hg-12(_n_ - 1) \(n\) (_n_ = 1, 2, and 3). Although they succeeded in obtaining samples with various \(T_{c}\) values, their oxygen contents could not be determined. The oxygen content of some Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 samples were investigated by neutron diffraction experiments.11-13 For instance, the oxygen content of the Hg-1212 sample with a maximum \(T_{c}\) of 127 K was determined to be 0.22.11 Wagner _et al._13 also reported the results of neutron diffraction experiments for Hg-1223 samples with \(T_{c}\) values of 94, 107, and 135 K. Their excess oxygen content \(d\) was determined to be 0.18, 0.22, and 0.27, respectively, and the occupancy of the chain site [1/2, 0, 0] was found to be almost constant (~0.09).

It has been an issue of particular interest whether the Hg-1223 sample with the highest \(T_{c}\) (~135 K) is optimally doped or underdoped. It has been pointed out that the dramatic increase in \(T_{c}\) of Hg-1223 above 150 K could be explained by either the optimization of hole concentration in the CuO2 plane or the substantial change in the electronic structure. If the former hypothesis were correct, a \(T_{c}\) higher than 135 K could be achieved under ambient pressure by simply adjusting the hole concentration. Recently, Carrington _et al._14 reported the existence of the anomaly in the temperature dependence of the normal-state electrical resistivity \(r\) for a single crystal sample of Hg-1223 with \(T_{c}\) = 134 K. This anomaly was similar to that observed in oxygen-deficient YBa2Cu3O3 which was considered to be associated with the formation of the "spin gap" or psuedogap,15 suggesting that the Hg-1223 sample is still underdoped.

Thermoelectric power of Hg-1223 with a \(T_{c}\) of 134-135 K has also been examined for both polycrystalline samples and single crystals to clarify the doping state.14,16 By comparing their thermopower values at room temperature _S_(290 K) of typically 5-10 _m_V/K with the universal relationship proposed by Obertelli _et al._,17 it was suggested that these Hg-1223 samples were still slightly underdoped. On the other hand, Isawa _et al._27 reported a negative thermopower value at room temperature for Pb-doped Hg-1223 samples, suggesting that their samples postannealed in oxygen are overdoped. Since absolute values of the thermopower may contain some experimental errors, more systematic studies may be required.

In the present study, we carefully prepared nearly single-phase Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 samples with various oxygen contents by postannealing as-synthesized materials either in various oxygen pressures of 1-800 atm or in reducing atmosphere. The oxygen content of these samples have been determined by an iodometric titration method. \(T_{c}\), electrical resistivity, and the thermoelectric power of these samples are systematically investigated as a function of excess oxygen content or the effective Cu valence. By comparing these properties for Hg-1223 with those for Hg-1212, it is confirmed that Hg-1223 with the highest \(T_{c}\) value of 135 K is actually optimally doped. The variable range of the excess oxygen content and the Cu valence to induce optimum \(T_{c}\) values in these superconductors are discussed in comparison with our previous results on Hg-1201.

## II Experiment

Samples were synthesized by direct solid state reaction of a mixed powder of high-purity HgO, BaO, CaO, and CuO. These starting monoxides were mixed to nominal compositions of HgBa2Ca_n_-1Cu_n_O_2_n_+2 (_n_ = 2 and 3) in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere. The mixed powder was pelletized and encapsulated in a quartz tube under vacuum condition (<10-4 Torr). Great care was taken to avoid exposing the pellets to air before they were encapsulated, because BaO easily absorbs moisture and CO2. Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 samples were sintered at 665 degC for 49-100 h and at 665-710 degC for 100 h, respectively. As was previously reported by Isawa _et al._,3 sintering for a long time (>100 h) at a relatively low temperature (~700 degC) is necessary to obtain a nearly single-phase of Hg-1223. In order to prepare samples with various oxygen contents, the as-synthesized samples were then annealed either in reducing atmosphere or in high-pressure oxygen. The annealing conditions are summarized in Tables I and II. For reducing treatments, the sintered samples were encapsulated with Zr metal in an evacuated quartz tube. As was previously demonstrated for the case of Hg-1201,9 the reduction level could be controlled by the amount of Zr metal. For oxidizing treatments, the oxygen pressure was varied between 1 and 800 atm to control the oxidation level. The annealing temperature was kept relatively low (270-400 degC), because it was found that annealing at higher temperatures resulted in decomposition of the phases. The annealing time was 12-48 h.

All the as-sintered and annealed samples were examined by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu \(K_{a}\) radiation and the lattice parameters of \(a\) and \(c\) axes were calculated from XRD data using the least-squares method. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the XRD patterns for as-sintered Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 samples, respectively. Most of the peaks can be indexed for the Hg-1212 and the Hg-1223 phases and impurity peaks, for example, from Ba2Cu3O3 and BaCuO2 are negligibly small in the patterns. After annealing under the conditions listed in Tables I and II, almost the same patterns as in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) were observed, confirming that the annealing caused no substantial decomposition of the phases.

The metal compositions of as-sintered samples were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive x-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX). They were found to be Hg:Ba:Ca:Cu=0.96:2.05:0.96:2.00 for Hg-1212 and Hg:Ba:Ca:Cu=0.93:2.05:2.03:3.00 for Hg-1223, which are in good agreement with the nominal compositions. The oxygen contents of both the as-sintered and annealed samples were determined by a conventional iodometric titration method. The detailed procedure of the titration has already been published elsewhere.18 The oxygen content was calculated on the assumption that the Hg valence is +2.00 and the Hg content is 1.00. The reproducibility for error between parallel experiments in the present iodometric titration method was found to be +- 0.01 or less. The Cu valence was then obtained from the oxygen content considering that the valence of excess oxygen is -2.0.

Superconducting critical temperature \(T_{c}\) of the samples was determined by measuring dc magnetic susceptibility using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer in a field cooling mode with a field of 10 Oe.

  The electrical resistivity was measured using a conventional four probe method with a current density of approximately 0.02 A/cm 2. The thermoelectric power was measured using a temperature gradient of 0.3-0.5 K. The sample temperature was measured using a calibrated Si diode sensor and the temperature difference between the two ends of the sample was measured by two pairs of Cu-constantan thermocouples. The absolute thermoelectric power was corrected by the thermoelectric power of Cu.

## III Results

### Variation of lattice parameters and \(T_{c}\)

Figures 2 and 3 show the temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility for some of the Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 samples listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Most of the samples exhibited one distinct superconducting transition with a Meissner volume fraction of 30-60% at low temperatures, indicating that excess oxygen is homogeneously distributed. A slight tail is observed prior to a distinct transition in a few samples. In this case, \(T_{c}\) is defined by the onset of the distinct transition.

Wide variations in \(T_{c}\) are observed for both the phases. For Hg-1212, the as-sintered sample exhibits the highest \(T_{c}\) of 127 K. With increasing the amount of Zr metal or the oxygen pressure in the postannealing process, \(T_{c}\) monotonically decreases to 91 and 98 K, respectively. This indicates that it is possible to vary the hole concentration of Hg-1212 by changing the amount of Zr metal as well as the oxygen pressure, as was demonstrated for Hg-1201.9 For Hg-1223, the sample annealed in 1 atm oxygen has the highest \(T_{c}\) of 135 K. The \(T_{c}\) value also monotonically decreases to 92 K with increasing the amount of Zr metal. On the other hand, the annealing in oxygen at a higher pressure of 600-800 atm leads to a \(T_{c}\) decrease of only 1-2 K. These variations in

Figures 4 and 5 show the relations of the \(a\)-axis and \(c\)-axis lattice parameters with the oxygen content determined by the iodometric titration method for Hg-1212 and Hg-1223, respectively. Both the \(a\)-axis and \(c\)-axis lattice parameters of Hg-1212 are found to decrease monotonically with an increase in the oxygen content, similar to the case for Hg-1201.[9] This reinforces that excess oxygen is homogeneously distributed in these samples. A similar tendency is observed for Hg-1223, although the variations in \(a\)-axis and \(c\)-axis parameters are rather small for the samples annealed in oxidizing atmosphere.

Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the relations of \(T_{c}\) with the excess oxygen content \(\delta\) and the \(a\)-axis lattice parameter for Hg-1212 and Hg-1223. The relations for Hg-1201 which has been published elsewhere[9] are also indicated. Parabolic or "bell-shaped" relations are observed in both figures for Hg-1212 as well as Hg-1201, indicating that their doping state can be extensively varied from underdoped to highly overdoped regimes. On the other hand, Hg-1223 seems to exhibit

  only a half of the parabola. For the Hg-1223 sample annealed in high-pressure oxygen, only a slight increase in the oxygen content is observed. It is found that the maximum \(T_{c}\) of 127 K for Hg-1212 is realized at \(\delta\) = 0.21 which is in good agreement with the value of 0.22 previously determined for a Hg-1212 sample with the same \(T_{c}\) by neutron diffraction (ND).[12] The excess oxygen content for the Hg-1223 sample with the maximum \(T_{c}\) of 135 K is 0.29, comparable to the value of 0.27 reported by Wagner _et al.[13]_ in their ND study.

Figure 7 shows the relations between \(T_{c}\) and the nominal Cu valence for Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 as well as Hg-1201. The Cu valence was calculated on the assumption that hole carrier is homogeneously supplied to each CuO 2 plane. It is clear that all the phases exhibit their maximum \(T_{c}\) values at the same Cu valence of 2.18-2.21.[19] This value agrees well with those reported for other high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors.[20, 21]

### Variation of resistivity and thermoelectric power

The data for HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) is taken from Ref. 9. The shaded lines are a guide to the eye.

  value of the order of 10 - 2 O cm is substantially larger than that of typically 10 - 3 O  expected for good polycrystal samples of high-_T__c_ superconductors, all the samples exhibit a positive temperature dependence. Moreover, the resistivity at room temperature systematically decreases with increasing the excess oxygen content, indicating that the resistivity actually reflects the variation in the in-plane resistivity \(r_{b}\) in spite of substantial contribution of the grain-boundary resistance. For the most underdoped Hg-1212 sample, an apparent downward deviation from a linear _r_-_T_ curve is observed. This anomaly appears similar to those reported in oxygen-deficient underdoped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (YBCO) single crystals.[15] These anomalies have been considered to be caused by the opening of a pseudogap in the spin excitation spectrum ('spin gap').

Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of thermoelectric power \(S\) for Hg-1212 samples. The peculiar temperature dependence is similar to those reported for other high-_T__c_ superconducting cuprates.[22, 23] The thermoelectric power monotonically decreases with increasing the degree of oxidation and shows negative values in the overdoped region. It has been proven both experimentally[17] and theoretically[24] that the thermoelectric power at room temperature generally decreases with increasing the hole concentration in high-_T__c_ superconducting cuprates. Obertelli _et al.[17]_ proposed a universal relation curve between the thermoelectric power at 290 K, _S_(290 K), and the hole content or \(T_{c}\) normalized by the optimum \(T_{c}\) value. (The similar relation is also proposed by Matsuura.[25]) The universal relation curve shows that _S_(290 K) for optimally doped samples is slightly larger than zero, approximately 3 \(\mu\)V/K, and _S_(290 K) for underdoped and highly overdoped samples is positive and negative, respectively. In Fig. 10, _S_(290 K) and \(T_{c}\) are plotted as a function of the Cu valence for Hg-1212 samples. _S_(290 K) for the optimally doped Hg-1212 sample is approximately 5 \(\mu\)V/K which is close to the value by Obertelli _et al.[17]_ It is evident that corresponding to the increase in the Cu valence, our Hg-1212 samples show the variation in _S_(290 K) similar to that of the universal relation. This reinforces that the doping state of Hg-1212 is actually controlled from the underdoped to the overdoped region. It is also noted that the highly overdoped Hg-1212 samples show negative _S_(290 K) values like other superconducting cuprates.

Figure 11 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for Hg-1223 samples with various oxygen contents. A systematic decrease in \(r\) at room temperature with increasing the oxygen content is also observed. Furthermore, the reduced samples as well as the as-sintered sample exhibit an apparent downward deviation from the linear _r_-_T_ curve which is similar to that observed in underdoped Hg-1212. In order to clearly find the temperature at which the anomaly begins, (_r_(_T_) - _r_(0))/_αT_ is plotted versus temperature in Fig. 12, as was proposed by Ito _et al.[15]_ Here, _r_(0) is the resistivity value at 0 K extrapolated from the _T_-linear part at higher temperatures and _α_ is the slope of the _T_-linear part. It is found that the characteristic temperature \(T\)0 at which the anomaly starts monotonically decreases with increasing the oxygen content. This systematic variation in \(T\)0 indicates that the observed anomaly has the same origin as that in oxygen-deficient YBCO, i.e., spin gap or psuedogap. The \(T\)0 values of 220-280 K are slightly larger than those observed for YBCO with _δ_ = 0.1-0.3 and _T__c_/_T__c_max= 0.95-0.7.[15] These larger \(T\)0 values seem consistent with the spin-gap opening temperature _T_* which has recently been found to be much higher than that in YBCO by NMR measurements.[26] For Hg-1223 single crystals with \(T_{c}\) = 134 K, a much larger \(T\)0 value of 370 K was previously reported by Carrington _et al._,[14] although they did not observe a systematic \(T\)0 variation. In contrast, no clear anomaly is

  observed for our sample with \(T_{c}\) = 135 K and the sample with a slightly larger oxygen content.

Figure 13 shows the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power for Hg-1223 samples. The temperature dependence which is similar to that observed in Hg-1212 as well as other high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates is observed. In Fig. 14, \(S\)(290 K) as well as \(T_{c}\) is plotted as a function of the Cu valence. It is clear that \(S\)(290 K) systematically decreases with increasing the Cu valence, as observed for Hg-1212, suggesting that it also follows the universal relation proposed by Obertelli _et al._[17] The sample with the highest \(T_{c}\) of 135 K shows an \(S\)(290 K) value of approximately 5 \(\mu\)V/K which is almost the same as the value observed for the optimally doped Hg-1212 sample in Fig. 10. A substantially smaller value of approximately 2 \(\mu\)V/K is observed for the sample with the largest oxygen content, although the value is still positive.

## IV Discussion

It is found that \(T_{c}\) and the transport properties of Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 phases can be extensively varied by postannealing in either reducing or oxidizing atmosphere, as was previously demonstrated for Hg-1201.[9] The results of titration confirm that these variations result from the wide variations in the excess oxygen content \(\delta\) or the Cu valence. The Hg-1212 samples exhibit a change in \(\delta\) from 0.10 to 0.31. These lower- and upper-limit values are comparable to the values of 0.08 and 0.35 which were previously determined by ND for underdoped and overdoped samples, respectively.[12] The variation in \(\delta\) from 0.16 to 0.30 for the Hg-1223 samples also well compares with the values of 0.19 and 0.27 reported in the recent ND study by Wagner _et al._[13]

It is clear in Fig. 6 that the \(\delta\) value increases with the number of the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane \(n\) in the unit cell. A similar tendency has also been observed in previous ND studies on different phases.[61, 12, 13] From the results of Fig. 7, this tendency seems to result from the fact that almost the same range of the Cu valence is allowed for all the phases. In the Hg-1223 phase, the Cu valence is exceptionally limited below approximately 2.20. As indicated in Fig. 6, the \(a\)-axis parameter systematically decreases with increasing \(\delta\) for each phase. However, the \(a\)-axis parameter for the Hg-1223 sample with \(T_{c}\) = 135 K of 3.853 A is very close to the intrinsic size of the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane of 3.855 A observed in the infinite layer compound CaCuO\({}_{2}\).[29] Thus the difficulty in further shrinking the \(a\)-axis parameter possibly limits the upper range of \(\delta\) allowed for Hg-1223 as well as overdoped Hg-1212. Another reason for this upper limit may be the stability of the Hg-O\({}_{\delta}\) charge reservoir layer itself, because mercury favors twofold oxygen coordination rather than threefold coordination. This latter reason seems more plausible, since it was reported that Hg-1223 incorporates more oxygen by partially substituting cations with higher valences such as Pb and Re for the Hg site.[27, 28]

The results of thermoelectric power measurements indicate that Hg-1212 follows the universal relation between \(S\)(290 K) and \(T^{\rm max}/T_{c}\) or the hole concentration proposed by Obertelli _et al._[17] That is to say, \(S\)(290 K) decreases monotonically with increasing the hole concentration and exhibits a slightly positive value of approximately 3-5 \(\mu\)V/K for optimally doped samples. Our Hg-1223 sample with the highest \(T_{c}\) of 135 K has almost the same \(S\)(290 K) value of approximately 5 \(\mu\)V/K as the optimally doped Hg-1212 sample. The anomaly in the electrical resistivity probably associated with the pseudogap or the spin gap is not observed for this sample as shown in Fig. 11. Considering these facts, we can conclude that the Hg-1223 sample with \(T_{c}\) = 135 K is actually optimally doped. The even smaller \(S\)(290 K) value for the Hg-1223 sample annealed in the highest oxygen pressure indicates that the doping state of Hg

  1223 can be varied to a slightly overdoped regime.

As mentioned earlier, previous ND studies on Hg-12(_n_ - 1) \(n\) (_n_ = 1 - 3) indicated that there exists approximately 0.1 chain-site [1/2, 0, 0] oxygen associated with the Cu substitution to the Hg site. [6, 13] Our previous titration measurements for Hg-1201 samples revealed that their excess oxygen content can be reduced to as small as 0.025, [9] suggesting a much smaller amount of chain-site oxygen. The EDX results for the present Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 samples suggest possible substitution of approximately 5% Hg-site by Cu and thus the existence of chain-site oxygen. However, it should be noted that all three systems, i.e., \(n\) = 1, 2, and 3 in Hg-12(_n_ - 1) \(n\) have similar parabolic \(T_{c}\) versus Cu valence curves as shown in Fig. 7 and exhibit optimum \(T_{c}\) values at the same Cu valence of 2.18-2.21 which is also comparable to the values for other cuprate superconductors. This fact suggests that the amount of chain-site oxygen in the present Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 samples is as small as that of our Hg-1201 samples. Furthermore it indicates that the chain-site oxygen, if any, supplies two holes as is the case for the oxygen at the interstitial [1/2, 1/2, 0] site. Xiong _et al._[8] reported that their Hg-1201 samples have the excess oxygen much larger than that expected from the simple ionic model \(p\) = 2 \(d\) (_p_: hole concentration). In contrast, the correlation in Fig. 7 clearly indicates that the assumption of \(p\) = 2 \(d\) is appropriate in our samples.

One of the most remarkable universal correlations concerning \(T_{c}\) in high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors is the linear relation between \(T_{c}\) and the muon spin relaxation rate \(\sigma\)(_T_ - 0) \(\times n_{s}\)/_m__ab_ (superconducting carrier density divided by in-plane effective mass) first reported by Uemura _et al._[30] They demonstrated that the \(n\) = 1, 2, and 3 compounds lie on the same linear line in the underdoped region, while \(T_{c}\) saturates near the optimally doped region. The higher optimum \(T_{c}\) values observed as \(n\) increases apparently correspond to larger _n__s_/_m__ab_ values, although these compounds included those with different charge reservoir blocks. In Fig. 15, we plot \(T_{c}\) of the present Hg-12(_n_ - 1) \(n\) (_n_ = 1,2,3) samples versus the normal carrier density estimated from the nominal Cu valence and lattice parameters. The underdoped and nearly optimally doped samples appear to lie on the same curve. Considering possible systematic deviation of the estimated carrier density from the actual normal carrier density which is basically equivalent to \(n_{s}\) in the underdoped region, this result seems consistent with Uemura's relation. Uemura interpreted the universal relation as evidence for superconductivity in the limit of Bose Einstein (BE) condensation for underdoped cuprate superconductors. [31] He also pointed out that the optimally doped state is given as the crossover point between BE condensation and conventional BCS condensation. The striking fact that this crossover point, i.e., the optimally doped state, is determined only by the same Cu valence in each CuO2 layer of approximately 2.20 seems consistent with the picture of BE condensation in real space rather than BCS condensation in momentum space. [31]

## V V. Conclusions

We have determined the oxygen content and the Cu valence by iodometric titration of single-phase HgBa2Ca_n_ - 1Cu_n_O2(_n_ + 1) + \(d\) (_n_ = 2,3) superconductors post-annealed under various conditions in either reducing or oxidizing atmosphere. Hg-1212 is found to exhibit a parabolic or "bell-shaped" relationship between \(T_{c}\) and the nominal Cu valence similar to that observed for Hg-1201, while Hg-1223 exhibits only a half of the parabola. Systematic evolution of the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the thermoelectric power is observed for both Hg-1212 and Hg-1223. In particular, both the phases in the underdoped region clearly exhibit the anomaly in the resistivity probably associated with the formation of pseudogap or spin gap which is similar to that previously reported in oxygen-deficient YBCO. The absence of this anomaly as well as the _S_(290 K) value as compared with those of Hg-1212 samples with various doping states confirms that the Hg-1223 samples with the highest \(T_{c}\) of 135 K and even larger Cu valence are optimally doped and slightly overdoped, respectively.

The optimum \(T_{c}\) values for both Hg-1212 and Hg-1223 as well as Hg-1201 are attained at the same nominal Cu valence of approximately 2.20 which is also comparable to those reported for other cuprate superconductors. This coincidence of the nominal Cu valence for the optimally doped Hg-12(_n_ - 1) \(n\) (_n_ = 1, 2, and 3) samples suggests that the simple ionic model where each excess oxygen supplies two holes is appropriate in the present Hg-12(_n_ - 1) \(n\) samples, which contrasts the previous results on the oxygen content analysis for Hg-1201 reported by Xiong _et al._ The same Cu valence for optimally doped samples as well as the universal relation of \(T_{c}\) with the normal carrier concentration observed in underdoped Hg-12(_n_ - 1) \(n\) samples seems consistent with the superconductivity in the limit of Bose Einstein condensation as previously pointed out by Uemura _et al._

* [25] Recent NMR measurements, for example, on Tl\({}_{2{\rm Ba}_{2}}\)Ca\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{10-\delta}\) suggest that the hole concentration differs between the pyramidal CuO\({}_{5}\) layers and the square CuO\({}_{2}\) plane by a factor of 1.37-1.64 [K. Mikhalev _et al._, Czech. J. Phys. **46** Suppl. S2, 1131 (1996)]. However, the averaged Cu valence seems to be a more appropriate parameter to consider here, since these different layers exhibit an identical \(T_{c}\) and are probably more strongly coupled in the superconducting state.
