###### Abstract

We measured the far infrared reflectivity of two superconducting Pr2-xCe2CuO4 films above and below \(T_{c}\). The reflectivity in the superconducting state increases and the optical conductivity drops at low energies, in agreement with the opening of a (possibly) anisotropic superconducting gap. The maximum energy of the gap scales roughly with \(T_{c}\) as 2D\({}_{\rm max}\)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\)\(\approx\) 4.7. We determined absolute values of the penetration depth at 5 K as \(\lambda_{ab}\)=(3300\(\pm\)700) A for \(x\)=0.15 and \(\lambda_{ab}\)=(2000\(\pm\)300) A for \(x\)=0.17. A spectral weight analysis shows that the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule is satisfied at conventional low energy scales \(\sim\)4D\({}_{\rm max}\).

 selected to measure our samples. We then searched for a dielectric function for the film that describes the reflectivity of the whole system using a standard thin film model. This procedure has been successfully used to account for the temperature dependence of the substrate phonons (in particular the SrTiO\({}_{3}\) soft mode) and far infrared properties.[21] We fitted both films normal state reflectivities in the whole spectral range (20\(-\)21000 cm\({}^{-1}\)) within 0.2%. The dielectric function thus obtained was utilized to generate the bulk reflectivities of PCCO above \(T_{c}\). In both samples, it turns out that below 200 cm\({}^{-1}\) the normal state bulk response is the same as the experimentally determined film reflectivity (within 0.2%) meaning that the substrate contribution is negligible in this low frequency range. As we discuss further, the superconducting transition is characterized by an increase of the low frequency reflectivity. The shape of this extra reflectivity is not trivial to simulate. However, as the superconducting state is more reflective than the normal state, it is safe to assume that the low frequency bulk and measured reflectivity are also identical in the superconducting state. In each film, beyond 100 cm\({}^{-1}\), the reflectivities of the normal and the superconducting state are identical, within the accuracy of the measurement, from 25 K, just above \(T_{c}\), down to the lowest temperature.

The overall bulk reflectivity of PCCO can then be obtained by combining the measured data below 200 cm\({}^{-1}\) to the bulk simulation above 100 cm\({}^{-1}\). Finally, we applied standard Kramers-Kronig analysis to such reconstructed spectra in order to extract the optical conductivity of PCCO. Below 20 cm\({}^{-1}\) we used a Hagen-Rubens (1\(-\alpha\langle\omega\rangle\)) extrapolation for the normal state reflectivity and a superconductor extrapolation (1\(-\)_bo_[4]) below \(T_{c}\). Above 21000 cm\({}^{-1}\) we used a constant up to 10\({}^{6}\) cm\({}^{-1}\) followed by a free electron 1/\(\omega^{4}\) termination.

Figure 1 shows the real part of the optical conductivity (\(\sigma_{1}\)) for \(x\)=0.15 (top panel) and 0.17 (bottom panel). The insets in this figure show the measured far-infrared reflectivity. In all panels the dashed line is taken just above \(T_{c}\) and the solid line at 5 K. In both compounds the far infrared reflectivity increases, corresponding to a depletion in the superconducting \(\sigma_{1}\) at low frequencies.

In Fig. 2 we plot the ratio between superconducting and normal reflectivity (left panel) and conductivity (right panel) for the \(x\)=0.15 (dashed line) and \(x\)=0.17 (solid line) samples. We note that there is an increase in the low energy reflectivity at 70 cm\({}^{-1}\) for \(x\)=0.15 and 50 cm\({}^{-1}\) for \(x\)=0.17. The corresponding decreases in the optical conductivity occurs at 90 cm\({}^{-1}\) and 60 cm\({}^{-1}\).

In a \(s\)-wave BCS superconductor a rise in the low frequency reflectivity is associated with an isotropic superconducting gap (2\(\Delta\)). However the BCS reflectivity is much flatter and closer to unity than what is seen in our data. Nevertheless, the reflectivity rise is compatible with the onset of an anisotropic gap. Indeed, the two strongest arguments against the observation of the gap in cuprates are (i) the energy range where the reflectivity increases does not vary with doping and (ii) cuprates are thought to be in the clean limit making the observation of a gap difficult. The first argument is clearly not applicable to our data. To counter the second point we can look at the low frequency scattering rate just above \(T_{c}\). In the optimally doped sample we have 1/\(\tau\)(0)=85 cm\({}^{-1}\) and in the overdoped material 1/\(\tau\)(0)= 30 cm\({}^{-1}\). These values are of the same order of the frequency where the reflectivity increases. It is then reasonable to assign the reflectivity rise and the conductivity drop to the superconducting gap. In the absence of a specific model for such a gap, we can only estimate the maximum gap value from the frequencies where the low energy reflectivity or conductivity in the superconducting state differs from the ones above \(T_{c}\). If we use the values obtained from \(\sigma_{1}\) we have a 2\(\Delta_{\rm max}/k_{B}T_{c}\) ratio of 6 for \(x\)=0.15 and 5.6 for \(x\)=0.17. This value is probably an overestimate of the gap energy. Considering the frequencies obtained from the reflectivity, the 2\(\Delta_{\rm max}/k_{B}T_{c}\) ratio is 4.7 for both samples, in closer agreement to the values inferred from the Raman \(B_{2g}\) symmetry in NCCO samples.[17, 18, 19]

The dotted straight lines are guides for the eye representing the average high frequency behavior. The arrows indicate the frequency where this linear behavior breaks down.

The insets show the far-infrared reflectivity for the respective samples. In all panels the dashed line corresponds to a temperature just above \(T_{c}\) and the solid line to 5 K.

  To further quantify the superconducting properties of PCCO, we looked at the \(f\)-sum rule. It follows from charge conservation and states that

\[\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\sigma_{1}(\omega^{\prime})d\omega^{\prime}=\frac{\pi^{2} }{Z_{0}}\frac{ne^{2}}{m},\] (1)

where \(Z_{0}\)\(\approx\) 377 \(\Omega\) is the vacuum impedance, \(n\) the charge density, and \(e\) and \(m\) the electronic charge and mass, respectively.

Infinite conductivity in the superconducting state is represented by a \(\delta(\omega)\) peak at the origin in \(\sigma_{1}\). The \(f\)-sum rule then implies that the spectral weight of the \(\delta(\omega)\) peak must come from finite frequencies, hence the decrease in \(\sigma_{1}\). In fact, Ferrell, Glover, and Tinkham (FGT) (Refs. [22] and [23]) have shown that the spectral weight lost at finites frequencies of \(\sigma_{1}\) in the superconducting state is recovered in the superfluid weight.

To verify the FGT sum rule we need to determine the superfluid weight. One way to calculate it is to use the imaginary part \(\sigma_{2}\) of the optical conductivity.[24] In the superconducting state one can write \(\sigma_{1}\) as

\[\sigma_{1}(\omega)=\frac{\pi^{2}}{Z_{0}}\Omega_{\rm sc}^{2}\delta(\omega)+ \sigma_{1}^{\prime}(\omega),\] (2)

where \(\Omega_{\rm sc}\) is the superconducting plasma frequency. \(\sigma_{2}\) then follows from Kramers-Kronig as

\[\sigma_{2}(\omega)=\frac{2\pi}{Z_{0}\omega}\Omega_{\rm sc}^{2}-\frac{2\omega} {\pi}\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma_{1}^{\prime}(\omega^{\prime})}{{ \omega^{\prime}}^{2}-\omega^{2}}d\omega^{\prime}\] (3)

and we define \(\sigma_{2}^{\rm sc}\) as the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (3).

Kramers-Kronig of the reflectivity data yield directly \(\sigma_{1}\) and \(\sigma_{2}\). Because \(\sigma_{1}\) is obtained only for finite frequencies, it has no information on the \(\delta(\omega)\) function and therefore equals \(\sigma_{1}^{\prime}\). We can thus apply Eq. (3) and calculate \(\sigma_{2}^{\rm sc}\).

Figure 3 shows that \(\sqrt{\omega\sigma_{2}^{\rm sc}}\) for both samples is indeed fairly constant below 500 cm\({}^{-1}\) and corresponds to \(\Omega_{\rm sc}\) = (4800 \(\pm\) 1000) cm\({}^{-1}\) for \(x\) = 0.15 and \(\Omega_{\rm sc}\)= (7900 \(\pm\) 750) cm\({}^{-1}\) for \(x\) = 0.17. The contributions to errors in \(\Omega_{\rm sc}\) come from (i) the uncertainties in fitting the low frequency \(\omega\sigma_{2}^{\rm sc}\) to a constant value; and (ii) different extrapolations used in the Kramers-Kronig calculations. The absolute value of the superconducting penetration depth at 5K can be calculated using \(\lambda_{ab}\)=(1/2 \(\pi\))\(\Omega_{\rm sc}\)\({}^{-1}\) and yield \(\lambda_{ab}\)=(3300 \(\pm\) 700) A for \(x\) = 0.15 and \(\lambda_{ab}\)=(2000 \(\pm\) 300) A for \(x\) = 0.17. These values are in good agreement with the ones obtained by microwave absorption.[25, 26]

We can now verify the FGT sum rule by comparing the spectral weight lost in \(\sigma_{1}\) to the superfluid weight calculated above. To do so, we define a partial differential sum rule

\[\Lambda^{2}(\omega)=\frac{Z_{0}}{\pi^{2}}\int\limits_{0^{\infty}}^{\omega}[ \sigma_{1}^{N}(\omega^{\prime})-\sigma_{1}^{S}(\omega^{\prime})]d\omega^{ \prime},\] (4)

where the superscripts \(N\) and \(S\) refer to the normal and superconducting states, respectively. One should read \(\Lambda(\omega)\) as the contribution from states up to \(\omega\) to the superconducting plasma frequency, i.e., \(\Omega_{\rm sc}\)= \(\Lambda(\omega\) \(\rightarrow\) \(\infty\)).

Figure 4 shows \(\Lambda(\omega)\) for both films. To correctly obtain \(\Lambda(\omega)\), one must integrate from 0\({}^{+}\) but our data only go down to 20 cm\({}^{-1}\). To get the area between 0 and 20 cm\({}^{-1}\), we fitted the normal state \(\sigma_{1}\) using a Drude peak. For lack of a good extrapolation, the superconducting \(\sigma_{1}\) was set to 0 below 20 cm\({}^{-1}\). Inspection of Fig. 1 shows that this approximation is reasonable for the overdoped sample. However it will largely overestimate \(\Lambda(\omega)\) in the optimally doped compound. In that case we used a constant extrapolation to zero frequency. The dashed lines in Fig. 4 are the superconducting plasma frequencies calculated from Fig. 3. The shaded areas indicate the error in these values.

Figure 4 is showing how far one must integrate the conductivity to obtain \(\Omega_{\rm sc}\) from \(\Lambda(\omega)\). Within error bars the FGT sum rule is fulfilled in both samples below 200 cm\({}^{-1}\) (25 meV). A similar analysis in underdoped Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8-\delta}\) shows that one must integrate Eq. (4) to very high energies (2 eV) in order to recover the spectral weight of the condensate.[78, 79] A similar effect was also seen in

  YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6.5}\) where the integration must be carried up to 0.5 eV to satisfy the FGT sum rule.[9] This energy range is characteristic of the boson spectrum responsible for the pairing mechanism, which led to the conclusion that the pairing mechanism was unconventional.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] In our PCCO samples, Fig. 4 shows that the states contributing to the formation of the superfluid lie at energies comparable to the phonon spectrum.

The energy scale over which the condensate is recovered as well as the superconducting gap value are much smaller than the magnitude of the normal state (pseudo) gap observed around 100 meV.[10, 11, 12] This is in striking contrast with hole doped cuprates where the area loss in the real part of the conductivity, due to superconductivity, occurs over an energy scale which is similar to the one associated with the pseudogap state. This might imply that the normal state gap in electron doped cuprates has a different microscopic origin from the pseudogap in hole doped cuprates.
