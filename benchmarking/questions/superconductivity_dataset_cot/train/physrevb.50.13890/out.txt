###### Abstract

We have measured the upper and lower critical fields of superconducting Ba_{6}C_{60}. Near T_{c} , from the slope of the measured upper critical field, dH_{c2}/dT = 0.45 T/K, we obtain the zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length as \xi_{\rm GL} = 120 A. Using the lower critical-field data, the penetration depth at T = 0 is estimated to be \lambda(0) = 1800 A. Combining \lambda(0) with the value of \xi_{\rm GL} , we estimate the Fermi energy E_{F} to be = 0.15 eV. Thus, in comparison with the alkali-metal-doped fullerenes, the superconducting parameters H_{c2}, \xi_{\rm GL}, and the resulting Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, are significantly different in the case of the superconducting Ba-doped fullerene.

The discovery of superconductivity in metal-doped C_{60} compounds[1, 2] has stimulated significant theoretical and experimental interest. For all alkali-metal-intercalated ful- lrides the superconducting phase has a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure[3] with a stoichiometry A_{3}C_{60} (where A is an alkali metal). Magnetic measurements on the two members of the family (Refs. [4, 5, 6]), K_{3}C_{60} (with a transition temperature T_{c} = 19 K) and Rb_{3}C_{60} (T_{c} = 29 K), have shown that both these materials are extreme type-II superconductors with Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameters \kappa\approx100. It has been found[7] that fcc C_{60} can be intercalated with divalent group calcium intercalant, and that near Ca:C_{60} ratio of 5:1 a phase transformation occurs to a simple-cubic phase which becomes superconducting below 8.4 K. This result on calcium-C_{60} compound demonstrates that superconductivity in fullerene alloys is not limited to alkali-metal doping alone. Recently, superconductivity (T_{c} = 7 K) has also been discovered in a barium intercalated fulleride[8] with a stoichiometry Ba_{6}C_{60}, in a pure body-centered phase. However, to the best of our knowledge no detailed study of the parameters for the Ca- or Ba-doped superconductors has been reported. In this paper we present our measurements of the upper and lower critical magnetic fields of the Ba_{6}C_{60} compound. Using the critical field data we evaluate the coherence length \xi, and penetration depth \lambda. We also discuss possible implications of the results obtained.

The Ba_{6}C_{60} samples were prepared via the metal azide route according to the procedure described by Iqbal _et al._,[9] using C_{60} (99.9% pure) obtained from Texas Fullerenes and pure barium azide BaN_{6}. After each synthesis, the samples were transferred in a dry box to x-ray capillaries for diffraction measurements. The Ba_{6}C_{60} powder was then sealed in a Pyrex tube under 1 atm of helium as an exchange gas for Raman scattering and magnetization measurements. The diffraction data showed the presence of only the bcc Ba_{6}C_{60} phase. Raman measurements show absence of disordered carbon and C_{60} phases in the sample. Magnetization was measured with a Quantum Design-MPMS2 type superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer at temperatures down to 1.8 K. In the magnetic data corrections were made to account for demagnetization effects assuming a spherical shape for the particles with demagnetizing factor n = \frac{1}{2}. However, in determining the upper critical field, since - 4 \pi M \llH, especially near T_{c} , no demagnetization corrections were made.

The low-field magnetization measurements showed a well-defined transition into a superconducting state with T_{c} = 7 K. The data showed that even at 2 K the observed magnetization was far from saturation (about 12% shielding) and indicating partial field penetration into the sample which can be caused by the effects of the small particle size being comparable to the penetration depth of the material.[10]

The value of the upper critical field is an important quantity since it gives direct information about microscopic parameters among which is the superconducting coherence length. From the SQUID data for the magnetization we determine the coherence length at T = 0 K, using a well-known approach,[11] as follows: A typical set of magnetic data obtained at two different applied fields, 0.1 and 0.4 T, respectively, are shown in Fig. 1(a). Along with the suppression of T_{c} at higher fields we observe a linear reversible regime in M(T) close to and below T_{c} which is indicative of the absence of vortex pinning and expected from GL theory where the magnetization is linearly proportional to |1 - T/T_{c}| near the transition.[12] The field-dependent critical temperature T_{c}(H) is thus determined as the intercept of a linear extrapolation of the magnetization in the superconducting state with the normal-state base line. We note that in the vicinity T_{c} the observed rounding in the M(T) dependence might be caused by diamagnetic fluctuations. The suppression of T_{c}(H) with the "critical field" H_{c2} at that temperature is shown in Fig. 1(b). A linear dependence adequately fits the temperature dependence of the so defined H_{c2} with a slope of 0.45 T/K. It may be useful to mention that the value of dH_{c2}/dT determined from an approach in which the temperature at which M(T) starts to deviate from the normal state value is within 10% of the same range as obtained above. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression[13]H_{c2}(0) = 0.7(\partial H_{c2}/\partial T_{T_{c}}T_{c}) we determine the extrapolated upper critical field at T = 0 K to be H_{c2} = 2.2 T. According to the relation[12]H_{c2} = \Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{\rm GL}^{2} we obtain the zero temperature coherence length to be \xi_{\rm GL}(0) = 120 A.

 The lower critical field was determined from the ZFC initial magnetization data. The sample was cooled from above T_{c} down to T<T_{c} in zero field (remanent field of about 0.1 Oe). Once the temperature was stabilized the magnetic field was applied and the magnetization measured versus increasing field magnitude. We define the lower critical field H_{c1}(T) as 1/(1 - _n_) times the lowest applied field at which the magnetization deviates from the linear behavior, and the external field starts to penetrate the sample. The lower critical field obtained in this way is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of temperature. The data fit well to the two-fluid expression for the temperature dependence of H_{c1}: H_{c1}(T) = H_{c1}(0)[1 - (T/T_{c})^{4}] (solid line in Fig. 2). From the fitting we extrapolate the lower critical field at zero temperature H_{c1}(0) = 130 Oe. Using the relation:[12]H_{c1}(0) = (\Phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda)ln(\lambda/_{\rm GL}), we estimate \lambda(0) = 1800 A and hence, the GL parameter \kappa = \lambda/_{\rm GL} = 15.

The superconducting parameters determined for Ba_{6}C_{60} are compared in Table 1 with the values obtained for K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60}. From this table it is obvious that the Ba_{6}C_{60} compound differs substantially from the alkali-metal-doped C_{60} systems in its superconducting properties. Besides the T_{c} , which is for example three times lower compared to that for K_{3}C_{60}, the upper critical field is extremely low, i.e., H_{c2,{\rm Ba}}(0) = 2.2 T which is = 0.045\timesH_{c2,{\rm K}0}(0), resulting in a relatively long coherence length, \xi_{\rm Ba}(0) = 5\times\xi_{\rm K}(0). The difference in H_{c2} cannot be accounted for just by the difference in T_{c} as may be done[4, 5] for K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} systems where the upper critical field slopes are approximately equal and the extrapolated critical field values at T = 0 are proportional to T_{c} . The hypothetical value of H_{c2} for Ba_{6}C_{60} estimated using the critical field slope of K_{3}C_{60} and T_{c} = 7 K would be about 20 T which is an order of magnitude greater than the observed value. Obviously, we are dealing with a system having much weaker coupling strength, resulting in a much lower transition temperature and upper critical field, and as a result, much longer coherence length. An estimate of the coupling strength in Ba_{6}C_{60} based on the analyses in Ref. 20 assuming coupling to the same low-energy intramolecular phonons (\Omega_{\rm ph} = 250 cm^{-1}), \mu^{\star} = 0.2 and the measured T_{c} gives \lambda = 0.8 which is to be compared with \lambda = 1.5 for K_{3}C_{60} and \lambda \approx 2.1 for Rb_{3}C_{60}. Thus, the coupling strength in Ba_{3}C_{60}, being in the intermediate range, is significantly weaker than that for the alkali-metal fullerides.

Several models have been proposed to explain superconductivity in the metal-doped fullerenes. Among them is the model based on phonon-mediated pairing employing either higher energy (0.12 eV) intramolecular modes[14, 15] or low-energy (0.02 eV) metal-C_{60} intermolecular modes[16]. A model of a superconducting state in the fullerides with purely electronic pairing mechanism has also been proposed[17]. Recent isotope effect experiments on Rb_{3}C_{60} have yielded a sizable shift in T_{c} indicating that the lattice is involved in pair formation[18, 19]. The analysis carried out in Ref. 20 (also dis

  cussed above) supports a model of superconductivity with intermediate to strong coupling via low-energy intramolecular phonons. Within the phononic mechanism there have been indications of weak, intermediate, and strong coupling in A_{3}C_{60} systems (see, e.g., Refs. [18] and [21]-[24]). Most of the experimental results and in particular variations of T_{c} can be explained on the basis of the weak-coupling BCS model with the density of states at the Fermi level varying with the structure (see, e.g., Refs. [5, 14, 15], and [25]). However, in order to account for the measured T_{c}'s within the weak-coupling BCS model high-energy (\Omega_{\rm ph}= 0.1 to 0.15 eV) intramolecular modes must be employed, and since the Fermi energy in the superconducting fullerides is low (see discussion below and Table 2), \Omega_{\rm ph}=E_{F}, which is outside the range of applicability (\Omega_{\rm ph}\llE_{F}) for the BCS as well as Eliashberg equations. This consideration gives further support to the strong-coupling model [20] described above. Nevertheless we assume the BCS expression for the superconducting energy gap 2\Delta/kT_{c} = 3.5 to be valid, although a larger value of this ratio corresponding to a stronger coupling would not affect the obtained qualitative results.[25] The clean limit expression for the penetration depth \lambda(0) = (m^{\ast}c^{2}/4m_{\ast}e^{2})[12] gives the ground-state value n_{s}/(m^{\ast}/m_{c}) = 8.75\times10^{20} cm^{-3}. Further, using the coherence length \xi(0) = (hv_{F})/ (\pi\Delta(0) = 1.76kT_{c} = 1 meV, we obtain the Fermi velocity v_{F} = 6.1\times10^{6} cm/s. Combining these two results we find the Fermi energy E_{F} = 0.15 eV and the effective electron mass m^{\ast} = 13m_{e} and n_{s} = 1.14\times10^{22} cm^{-3}. This value of the electron density implies [27] a charge transfer of 1.3 in order to be consistent with the theoretical value 1.72\times10^{22} cm^{-3} obtained for a bcc structure with the lattice constant [7] of 11.171 A assuming Ba-C_{60} charge transfer of 2. In Table 2 we compare the effective mass, m^{\ast}/m_{e}, Fermi momentum, k_{F}, Fermi velocity, v_{F}, and Fermi energy, E_{F}, for different superconducting systems, including fullerides, high-T_{c} ceramics, and conventional metals.

A few comments on the assumptions regarding the "clean-limit" approximation which forms the basis of the discussions above would be informative. High resistivities of superconducting fullerenes result in extremely short mean free paths, if the Drude model is employed. For instance, the resistivity of the order of 1 m\Omega cm in Ba_{6}C_{60} films [30] would imply an extreme dirty limit superconductor with a mean free path l = 1 - 2 A which is much shorter than the coherence length. This means that in order to use the clean limit analyses the coherence length and the penetration depth should be rescaled according to \xi_{\rm QL}= (\xi_{0}l)^{1/2}, \lambda = \lambda_{L}(1 + \xi_{0}/l)^{1/2}, in order to obtain the values for \xi_{0} the Pippard coherence length, and \lambda_{L} the London penetration depth which are the appropriate parameters in the "dirty-limit." Using our estimated values \xi_{\rm QL} = 120 A, \lambda = 1800 A, and l = 2 A we thus obtain \xi_{0} = 7200 A and \lambda_{L} = 30 A. However, this value 30 A for the London penetration depth would result in a ground-state value for the electron density n_{s} equal to 3.2\times10^{24} cm^{-3} [obtained using the above relationship for the penetration depth and n_{s}/(m^{\ast}/m_{e})], which is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the maximum possible value of 1.72\times10^{22} cm^{-3}. There have been several studies addressing the issue of mean free path in superconducting fullerenes. Using specific heat and upper critical field data Ramirez _et al._[23] estimated l to be \sim 10 A for powder K_{3}C_{60}. About the same value (10-20 A) was inferred from the magnetotransport studies of K_{3}C_{60} films by Wang _et al._[31] Rotter _et al._[22] obtained a mean free path of \sim 20 A from their infrared reflectivity measurements of Rb_{3}C_{60} powder.

  of K_{3}C_{60} films led Palstra _et al._[32] to conclude that the high resistivity does not arise from the microscopic disorder, but comes about from the granular nature of their films, with a grain size of \sim70 A. Fluctuation conductivity studies of K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} single crystals [33] showed no effects of granularity and gave a lower limit for the domain size of about 0.6 \mum. If we assume the mean free path l = 10 A in our sample, the dirty limit corrections to the measured coherence length and penetration depth give \xi_{0} = 1440 A and \lambda_{L} = 150 A. As a result n_{s}/(m^{*}m_{e}) = 1.26\times10^{23} cm ^{-3} which is more than one order of magnitude greater than the theoretical value (since m^{*}m_{e} = 10). The corresponding value for l = 20 A is n_{s}/(m^{*}/m_{e}) = 3.2\times10^{22} cm ^{-3}, with m^{*}/m_{e}^{-}5 yielding n_{s} = 1.7\times 10^{23} which is still one order of magnitude too large. On the other hand, l = 70 A gives the electronic parameters to within a factor of 2 equal to the clean limit values: \xi_{0} = 206A, \lambda_{L} = 900m^{*}/m_{e} = 12.5, k_{F} = 1.1\times10^{8} cm ^{-1}, v_{F} = 1\times10^{7} cm/s and E_{F} = 0.35 eV. However, the electron density n_{s} = 4.4\times10^{22} cm ^{-3} is still a little too high, implying that the mean free path should be even longer to account for the measured quantities and for the analysis to be self-consistent.

Interestingly, regardless of the substantial difference in superconducting properties, the superconducting fullerides have the same characteristics for the electronic system. For example, the Fermi energies found in K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} lie within the range 0.1 to 0.2 eV, which is exactly in the range at the value (0.15 eV) we have estimated for Ba_{6}C_{60} . A factor of 2 difference in the parameters is well within the uncertainties in the experimental data and due to assumptions made in the evaluations. In summary, enhanced effective mass and a Fermi momentum comparable to those of conventional superconducting metals, in addition to a small Fermi velocity and Fermi energy (about two orders of magnitude smaller than those in metals) appear to be the key features of superconducting fullerides. Table II also suggests that fullerene-based superconductors are similar to high-T_{c} superconductors as far as electronic properties are concerned. However, in contrast to the high-T_{c} cuprates with large anisotropy which has a strong impact on their physical properties, the fullerides have cubic lattice structures.

In conclusion, we have measured the magnetic properties of Ba_{6}C_{60} superconductor with T_{c} = 7 K and a bcc lattice structure. The evaluated superconducting parameters, such as the upper critical field slope and the coherence length, differ substantially from those in K_{3} and Rb_{3}C_{60} compounds possessing an fcc structure, indicating that Ba_{6}C_{60} is a weaker coupled superconducting system than the other members of the C_{60} family. Further studies are required to explain the interconnection between the structure and superconducting properties. What is remarkable, is that the parameters describing one-particle excitations are found to be roughly the same for alkali- and alkaline-earth-C_{60} systems, and very similar to those found in high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors.

###### Abstract

We have measured the upper and lower critical fields of superconducting Ba_{6}C_{60}. Near T_{c} , from the slope of the measured upper critical field, dH_{c2}/dT = 0.45 T/K, we obtain the zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau coherence length as \xi_{\rm GL} = 120 A. Using the lower critical-field data, the penetration depth at T = 0 is estimated to be \lambda(0) = 1800 A. Combining \lambda(0) with the value of \xi_{\rm GL} , we estimate the Fermi energy E_{F} to be = 0.15 eV. Thus, in comparison with the alkali-metal-doped fullerenes, the superconducting parameters H_{c2}, \xi_{\rm GL}, and the resulting Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa, are significantly different in the case of the superconducting Ba-doped fullerene.

The discovery of superconductivity in metal-doped C_{60} compounds[1, 2] has stimulated significant theoretical and experimental interest. For all alkali-metal-intercalated ful- lrides the superconducting phase has a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure[3] with a stoichiometry A_{3}C_{60} (where A is an alkali metal). Magnetic measurements on the two members of the family (Refs. [4, 5, 6]), K_{3}C_{60} (with a transition temperature T_{c} = 19 K) and Rb_{3}C_{60} (T_{c} = 29 K), have shown that both these materials are extreme type-II superconductors with Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameters \kappa\approx100. It has been found[7] that fcc C_{60} can be intercalated with divalent group calcium intercalant, and that near Ca:C_{60} ratio of 5:1 a phase transformation occurs to a simple-cubic phase which becomes superconducting below 8.4 K. This result on calcium-C_{60} compound demonstrates that superconductivity in fullerene alloys is not limited to alkali-metal doping alone. Recently, superconductivity (T_{c} = 7 K) has also been discovered in a barium intercalated fulleride[8] with a stoichiometry Ba_{6}C_{60}, in a pure body-centered phase. However, to the best of our knowledge no detailed study of the parameters for the Ca- or Ba-doped superconductors has been reported. In this paper we present our measurements of the upper and lower critical magnetic fields of the Ba_{6}C_{60} compound. Using the critical field data we evaluate the coherence length \xi, and penetration depth \lambda. We also discuss possible implications of the results obtained.

The Ba_{6}C_{60} samples were prepared via the metal azide route according to the procedure described by Iqbal _et al._,[9] using C_{60} (99.9% pure) obtained from Texas Fullerenes and pure barium azide BaN_{6}. After each synthesis, the samples were transferred in a dry box to x-ray capillaries for diffraction measurements. The Ba_{6}C_{60} powder was then sealed in a Pyrex tube under 1 atm of helium as an exchange gas for Raman scattering and magnetization measurements. The diffraction data showed the presence of only the bcc Ba_{6}C_{60} phase. Raman measurements show absence of disordered carbon and C_{60} phases in the sample. Magnetization was measured with a Quantum Design-MPMS2 type superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer at temperatures down to 1.8 K. In the magnetic data corrections were made to account for demagnetization effects assuming a spherical shape for the particles with demagnetizing factor n = \frac{1}{2}. However, in determining the upper critical field, since - 4 \pi M \llH, especially near T_{c} , no demagnetization corrections were made.

The low-field magnetization measurements showed a well-defined transition into a superconducting state with T_{c} = 7 K. The data showed that even at 2 K the observed magnetization was far from saturation (about 12% shielding) and indicating partial field penetration into the sample which can be caused by the effects of the small particle size being comparable to the penetration depth of the material.[10]

The value of the upper critical field is an important quantity since it gives direct information about microscopic parameters among which is the superconducting coherence length. From the SQUID data for the magnetization we determine the coherence length at T = 0 K, using a well-known approach,[11] as follows: A typical set of magnetic data obtained at two different applied fields, 0.1 and 0.4 T, respectively, are shown in Fig. 1(a). Along with the suppression of T_{c} at higher fields we observe a linear reversible regime in M(T) close to and below T_{c} which is indicative of the absence of vortex pinning and expected from GL theory where the magnetization is linearly proportional to |1 - T/T_{c}| near the transition.[12] The field-dependent critical temperature T_{c}(H) is thus determined as the intercept of a linear extrapolation of the magnetization in the superconducting state with the normal-state base line. We note that in the vicinity T_{c} the observed rounding in the M(T) dependence might be caused by diamagnetic fluctuations. The suppression of T_{c}(H) with the "critical field" H_{c2} at that temperature is shown in Fig. 1(b). A linear dependence adequately fits the temperature dependence of the so defined H_{c2} with a slope of 0.45 T/K. It may be useful to mention that the value of dH_{c2}/dT determined from an approach in which the temperature at which M(T) starts to deviate from the normal state value is within 10% of the same range as obtained above. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) expression[13]H_{c2}(0) = 0.7(\partial H_{c2}/\partial T_{T_{c}}T_{c}) we determine the extrapolated upper critical field at T = 0 K to be H_{c2} = 2.2 T. According to the relation[12]H_{c2} = \Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi_{\rm GL}^{2} we obtain the zero temperature coherence length to be \xi_{\rm GL}(0) = 120 A.

 The lower critical field was determined from the ZFC initial magnetization data. The sample was cooled from above T_{c} down to T<T_{c} in zero field (remanent field of about 0.1 Oe). Once the temperature was stabilized the magnetic field was applied and the magnetization measured versus increasing field magnitude. We define the lower critical field H_{c1}(T) as 1/(1 - _n_) times the lowest applied field at which the magnetization deviates from the linear behavior, and the external field starts to penetrate the sample. The lower critical field obtained in this way is shown in Fig. 2 as a function of temperature. The data fit well to the two-fluid expression for the temperature dependence of H_{c1}: H_{c1}(T) = H_{c1}(0)[1 - (T/T_{c})^{4}] (solid line in Fig. 2). From the fitting we extrapolate the lower critical field at zero temperature H_{c1}(0) = 130 Oe. Using the relation:[12]H_{c1}(0) = (\Phi_{0}/4\pi\lambda)ln(\lambda/_{\rm GL}), we estimate \lambda(0) = 1800 A and hence, the GL parameter \kappa = \lambda/_{\rm GL} = 15.

The superconducting parameters determined for Ba_{6}C_{60} are compared in Table 1 with the values obtained for K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60}. From this table it is obvious that the Ba_{6}C_{60} compound differs substantially from the alkali-metal-doped C_{60} systems in its superconducting properties. Besides the T_{c} , which is for example three times lower compared to that for K_{3}C_{60}, the upper critical field is extremely low, i.e., H_{c2,{\rm Ba}}(0) = 2.2 T which is = 0.045\timesH_{c2,{\rm K}0}(0), resulting in a relatively long coherence length, \xi_{\rm Ba}(0) = 5\times\xi_{\rm K}(0). The difference in H_{c2} cannot be accounted for just by the difference in T_{c} as may be done[4, 5] for K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} systems where the upper critical field slopes are approximately equal and the extrapolated critical field values at T = 0 are proportional to T_{c} . The hypothetical value of H_{c2} for Ba_{6}C_{60} estimated using the critical field slope of K_{3}C_{60} and T_{c} = 7 K would be about 20 T which is an order of magnitude greater than the observed value. Obviously, we are dealing with a system having much weaker coupling strength, resulting in a much lower transition temperature and upper critical field, and as a result, much longer coherence length. An estimate of the coupling strength in Ba_{6}C_{60} based on the analyses in Ref. 20 assuming coupling to the same low-energy intramolecular phonons (\Omega_{\rm ph} = 250 cm^{-1}), \mu^{\star} = 0.2 and the measured T_{c} gives \lambda = 0.8 which is to be compared with \lambda = 1.5 for K_{3}C_{60} and \lambda \approx 2.1 for Rb_{3}C_{60}. Thus, the coupling strength in Ba_{3}C_{60}, being in the intermediate range, is significantly weaker than that for the alkali-metal fullerides.

Several models have been proposed to explain superconductivity in the metal-doped fullerenes. Among them is the model based on phonon-mediated pairing employing either higher energy (0.12 eV) intramolecular modes[14, 15] or low-energy (0.02 eV) metal-C_{60} intermolecular modes[16]. A model of a superconducting state in the fullerides with purely electronic pairing mechanism has also been proposed[17]. Recent isotope effect experiments on Rb_{3}C_{60} have yielded a sizable shift in T_{c} indicating that the lattice is involved in pair formation[18, 19]. The analysis carried out in Ref. 20 (also dis

  cussed above) supports a model of superconductivity with intermediate to strong coupling via low-energy intramolecular phonons. Within the phononic mechanism there have been indications of weak, intermediate, and strong coupling in A_{3}C_{60} systems (see, e.g., Refs. [18] and [21]-[24]). Most of the experimental results and in particular variations of T_{c} can be explained on the basis of the weak-coupling BCS model with the density of states at the Fermi level varying with the structure (see, e.g., Refs. [5, 14, 15], and [25]). However, in order to account for the measured T_{c}'s within the weak-coupling BCS model high-energy (\Omega_{\rm ph}= 0.1 to 0.15 eV) intramolecular modes must be employed, and since the Fermi energy in the superconducting fullerides is low (see discussion below and Table 2), \Omega_{\rm ph}=E_{F}, which is outside the range of applicability (\Omega_{\rm ph}\llE_{F}) for the BCS as well as Eliashberg equations. This consideration gives further support to the strong-coupling model [20] described above. Nevertheless we assume the BCS expression for the superconducting energy gap 2\Delta/kT_{c} = 3.5 to be valid, although a larger value of this ratio corresponding to a stronger coupling would not affect the obtained qualitative results.[25] The clean limit expression for the penetration depth \lambda(0) = (m^{\ast}c^{2}/4m_{\ast}e^{2})[12] gives the ground-state value n_{s}/(m^{\ast}/m_{c}) = 8.75\times10^{20} cm^{-3}. Further, using the coherence length \xi(0) = (hv_{F})/ (\pi\Delta(0) = 1.76kT_{c} = 1 meV, we obtain the Fermi velocity v_{F} = 6.1\times10^{6} cm/s. Combining these two results we find the Fermi energy E_{F} = 0.15 eV and the effective electron mass m^{\ast} = 13m_{e} and n_{s} = 1.14\times10^{22} cm^{-3}. This value of the electron density implies [27] a charge transfer of 1.3 in order to be consistent with the theoretical value 1.72\times10^{22} cm^{-3} obtained for a bcc structure with the lattice constant [7] of 11.171 A assuming Ba-C_{60} charge transfer of 2. In Table 2 we compare the effective mass, m^{\ast}/m_{e}, Fermi momentum, k_{F}, Fermi velocity, v_{F}, and Fermi energy, E_{F}, for different superconducting systems, including fullerides, high-T_{c} ceramics, and conventional metals.

A few comments on the assumptions regarding the "clean-limit" approximation which forms the basis of the discussions above would be informative. High resistivities of superconducting fullerenes result in extremely short mean free paths, if the Drude model is employed. For instance, the resistivity of the order of 1 m\Omega cm in Ba_{6}C_{60} films [30] would imply an extreme dirty limit superconductor with a mean free path l = 1 - 2 A which is much shorter than the coherence length. This means that in order to use the clean limit analyses the coherence length and the penetration depth should be rescaled according to \xi_{\rm QL}= (\xi_{0}l)^{1/2}, \lambda = \lambda_{L}(1 + \xi_{0}/l)^{1/2}, in order to obtain the values for \xi_{0} the Pippard coherence length, and \lambda_{L} the London penetration depth which are the appropriate parameters in the "dirty-limit." Using our estimated values \xi_{\rm QL} = 120 A, \lambda = 1800 A, and l = 2 A we thus obtain \xi_{0} = 7200 A and \lambda_{L} = 30 A. However, this value 30 A for the London penetration depth would result in a ground-state value for the electron density n_{s} equal to 3.2\times10^{24} cm^{-3} [obtained using the above relationship for the penetration depth and n_{s}/(m^{\ast}/m_{e})], which is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the maximum possible value of 1.72\times10^{22} cm^{-3}. There have been several studies addressing the issue of mean free path in superconducting fullerenes. Using specific heat and upper critical field data Ramirez _et al._[23] estimated l to be \sim 10 A for powder K_{3}C_{60}. About the same value (10-20 A) was inferred from the magnetotransport studies of K_{3}C_{60} films by Wang _et al._[31] Rotter _et al._[22] obtained a mean free path of \sim 20 A from their infrared reflectivity measurements of Rb_{3}C_{60} powder.

  of K_{3}C_{60} films led Palstra _et al._[32] to conclude that the high resistivity does not arise from the microscopic disorder, but comes about from the granular nature of their films, with a grain size of \sim70 A. Fluctuation conductivity studies of K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} single crystals [33] showed no effects of granularity and gave a lower limit for the domain size of about 0.6 \mum. If we assume the mean free path l = 10 A in our sample, the dirty limit corrections to the measured coherence length and penetration depth give \xi_{0} = 1440 A and \lambda_{L} = 150 A. As a result n_{s}/(m^{*}m_{e}) = 1.26\times10^{23} cm ^{-3} which is more than one order of magnitude greater than the theoretical value (since m^{*}m_{e} = 10). The corresponding value for l = 20 A is n_{s}/(m^{*}/m_{e}) = 3.2\times10^{22} cm ^{-3}, with m^{*}/m_{e}^{-}5 yielding n_{s} = 1.7\times 10^{23} which is still one order of magnitude too large. On the other hand, l = 70 A gives the electronic parameters to within a factor of 2 equal to the clean limit values: \xi_{0} = 206A, \lambda_{L} = 900m^{*}/m_{e} = 12.5, k_{F} = 1.1\times10^{8} cm ^{-1}, v_{F} = 1\times10^{7} cm/s and E_{F} = 0.35 eV. However, the electron density n_{s} = 4.4\times10^{22} cm ^{-3} is still a little too high, implying that the mean free path should be even longer to account for the measured quantities and for the analysis to be self-consistent.

Interestingly, regardless of the substantial difference in superconducting properties, the superconducting fullerides have the same characteristics for the electronic system. For example, the Fermi energies found in K_{3}C_{60} and Rb_{3}C_{60} lie within the range 0.1 to 0.2 eV, which is exactly in the range at the value (0.15 eV) we have estimated for Ba_{6}C_{60} . A factor of 2 difference in the parameters is well within the uncertainties in the experimental data and due to assumptions made in the evaluations. In summary, enhanced effective mass and a Fermi momentum comparable to those of conventional superconducting metals, in addition to a small Fermi velocity and Fermi energy (about two orders of magnitude smaller than those in metals) appear to be the key features of superconducting fullerides. Table II also suggests that fullerene-based superconductors are similar to high-T_{c} superconductors as far as electronic properties are concerned. However, in contrast to the high-T_{c} cuprates with large anisotropy which has a strong impact on their physical properties, the fullerides have cubic lattice structures.

In conclusion, we have measured the magnetic properties of Ba_{6}C_{60} superconductor with T_{c} = 7 K and a bcc lattice structure. The evaluated superconducting parameters, such as the upper critical field slope and the coherence length, differ substantially from those in K_{3} and Rb_{3}C_{60} compounds possessing an fcc structure, indicating that Ba_{6}C_{60} is a weaker coupled superconducting system than the other members of the C_{60} family. Further studies are required to explain the interconnection between the structure and superconducting properties. What is remarkable, is that the parameters describing one-particle excitations are found to be roughly the same for alkali- and alkaline-earth-C_{60} systems, and very similar to those found in high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors.
