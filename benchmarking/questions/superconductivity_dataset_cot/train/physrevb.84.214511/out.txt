Hechang Lei (^{\text{\text{\textregistered}}}^{\text double chains are separated by Ba^{2+} ions and are slightly tilted off the _bc_ plane. The tilting directions are opposite between the two neighboring layers as shown in Fig. 1(d). The shape of the BaFe_{2}Se_{3} crystal is long plate like. The XRD pattern of a BaFe_{2}Se_{3} crystal [Fig. 1(c)] reveals that the crystal surface is normal to the a axis with the plate-shaped surface parallel to the _bc_ plane. Moreover, the b axis is along the long direction of crystal in the _bc_ plane. The EDX spectrum of a single crystal confirms the presence of Ba, Fe, and Se. The average atomic ratios determined from EDX are Ba : Fe : Se = 1.00(4) : 1.9(1) : 3.1(1), close to the expected stoichiometric BaFe_{2}Se_{3} ratio. Hence there are no vacancies on either Ba or Fe sites, which is different from K_{x}Fe_{2-x}Se_{2}.[5, 13]

The features of Fe _K_-edge XANES spectrum of BaFe_{x}Se_{3} [Fig. 2(a)] are similar to FeSe_{x}.[14] The prepeak A (\sim7112.5 eV) is due to either dipole or quadrupole 1s\longrightarrow 3d transitions. The shoulder B with maximum absorption jump at \sim7118.4 eV can be ascribed to the 1s\longrightarrow 4p transition. When compared to the spectrum of FeO, the shoulder B is located at the lower energy side, suggesting that the valence of Fe is slightly smaller than 2+. The valence of Fe is evaluated by linear interpolation of the energy of BaFe_{2}Se_{3} with those of standards [Fe foil (metallic Fe), FeO (Fe^{2+}), and Fe_{2}O_{3} (Fe^{3+})]. From the peak of first-derivative spectra corresponding to the maximum absorption jump, we obtain \sim1.87+ for Fe valence, which is close to the value for FeSe_{x}.[14] On the other hand, there are two features for Se _K_-edge XANES spectrum of BaFe_{2}Se_{3} [Fig. 2(b)]. The feature C is mainly due to the 1s\longrightarrow 4p dipole transition and the broad hump D should be a multiple scattering of the photoelectron with the near neighbors.[15] By extrapolating the maximum absorption jumps of Se (\sim12659.2 eV) and CeO_{2} (\sim12662 eV),[14] we estimate \sim-1.98 for the Se valence, consistent with the formal value of Se ion (2-). For the Fe site, the nearest neighbors are four Se atoms [1\times Se(I), 2\times Se(II), and 1\times Se(III)] with four different distances close to \sim2.418 A and the next nearest neighbors are three Fe atoms with almost the same distance (\sim2.723 A).[8] From the joint analysis of Fe and Se edges, EXAFS data using a single bond distance for Fe-Se and Fe-Fe, and by fitting the k range 3.2-18.4 A^{-1} for Fe K edge and 2-14 A^{-1} for Se K edge [main panels and insets of Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)], the fitted average Fe-Se and Fe-Fe bond lengths are d_{\text{Fe-Se}}=2.428(5) A and d_{\text{Fe-Fe}}=2.71(5) A. This is consistent with the reported values.[8]

Temperature dependence of the resistivity \rho(T) of BaFe_{2}Se_{3} crystal for \mu_{0}H=0 and 9 T indicates that this material is a semiconductor in the measured temperature region (Fig. 3). The room-temperature value \rho(300\,\text{K}) is about 17 \Omega\,\text{cm}, which is much larger than in BaFe_{2}S_{3} (\sim0.35 \Omega\,\text{cm}).[16] Fits of the \rho(T) at high temperature using the thermal activation model \rho=\rho_{0}\exp(E_{a}/k_{B}T), where \rho_{0} is a prefactor, E_{a} is thermal activated energy, and k_{B} is Boltzmann's constant, gives E_{a}=0.178(1) eV in the temperature range above 170 K (inset in Fig. 3), which is also much larger than in BaFe_{2}S_{3}.[16, 17] The larger room-temperature resistivity and E_{a} can be ascribed to the increase of structural distortion which might localize the carriers and increase the band gap when compared to BaFe_{2}S_{3}.[8] For BaFe_{2}S_{3}, bond lengths are almost identical for all four Fe-S bonds, in contrast to very different bond lengths for BaFe_{2}Se_{3}. Moreover, the Fe-Fe bond distances in a single chain are identical for BaFe_{2}S_{3}, whereas they are different for BaFe_{2}Se_{3}, where the longer and shorter bonds alternately connect along the b axis. All structural features imply that in the former compound the coordination polyhedron is more symmetric than in the latter.

  It should be noted that the shorter Fe-Fe bond in BaFe_{2}S_{3} may also have some contribution to higher conductivity. On the other hand, when compared to BaFe_{2}S_{3}, which exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) below 25 K,[16] there is no obvious MR in BaFe_{2}Se_{3} as shown in Fig. 3.

Temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) of BaFe_{2}Se_{3} single crystal [Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)] cannot be fitted using Curie-Weiss law up to 390 K. It decreases with decreasing temperature for all field directions (H\|a, b, and c). It suggests that there is AFM interaction up to 390 K, in agreement with neutron results that found short-range correlations (SRC).[9, 10] Another characteristic in \chi(T) curves is a transition appearing at about 255 K for all three field directions, which is ascribed to a crossover from short-range AFM correlation to long-range AFM order.[9, 10] It should be noted that the absolute \chi_{a}(T) is much smaller than \chi_{b}(T) and \chi_{c}(T). Nevertheless, similar to H\,\|b, a Curie-like upturn in susceptibility is seen below 255 K for H\|c, while a faster drop is seen below 255 K for H\|a. It suggests that the easy axis of magnetization direction is a axis. According to mean-field theory for the collinear antiferromagnet, magnetic susceptibility along the easy-axis direction goes to zero for T\to 0, whereas perpendicular to the easy-axis magnetization direction is nearly constant below T_{N}. This is consistent with the neutron results.[9, 10] The small positive value of \chi_{a}(T\to 0) is probably due to the presence of a van Vleck paramagnetism. A large diversity of susceptibilities between H\|a, H\,\|b, and H\|c persisting up to 390 K suggests that there may be an intriguing anisotropy of SRC in the system. On the other hand, when the magnetic field was applied along the c axis, there is no obvious hysteresis between zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) measurements. The lack of hysteresis suggests that the ferromagnetic component of magnetic interactions between the Fe chains along the c axis is very weak. This can be ascribed to the large Fe-Fe (or ferromagnetic Fe4 plaquette) interchain distance (d_{\rm Fe-Fe}^{\rm interchain}\sim 6.441 A).[8] In contrast, for H\,\|b, the ZFC

  and FC measurements exhibit significant hysteresis due to the fact of short Fe-Fe (or ferromagnetic Fe4 plaquette) intrachain distance (d_{\text{Fe-Fe}}^{\text{intrachain}}\sim 2.720 and 2.727 A),[8] resulting in strong magnetic interaction. The hysteresis between the ZFC and FC curves extends up to 390 K, suggesting that this intrachain interaction exists at temperatures above the long-range order.

Isothermal M(H) for H\|a, H\|b, and H\|c [Figs. 4(d), 4(e), and 4(f)] at various temperatures show that there is no hysteresis for all three field directions, which confirms the AFM order in the system and excludes the ferromagnetic impurities. For H\|a, the slopes of M(H) increase with increasing temperature, but for the other two directions, M(H) curves are almost unchanged, consistent with the M(T) results. Moreover, the slopes of M(H) are H\|b>H\|c>H\|a for all of measured temperatures, corresponding to the increase of paramagnetic moment when magnetic field is rotated from a toward c and then toward the b axis, as shown Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c).

On the other hand, there is a small drop at about 10 K. This is also observed in a previous paper and might correspond to the superconducting transition.[9] In order to clarify whether this transition is extrinsic or intrinsic, we measured the other two samples from the same batch. As shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), sample B exhibits a similar drop at about 10 K for \mu_{0}H=0.1 mT and 0.1 T, but the superconducting volume fraction is only about 0.15% at 1.8 K for \mu_{0}H=0.1 mT. On the other hand, sample C does not show any drop below 15 K for \mu_{0}H=0.1 T. These results imply that this superconducting transition should be extrinsic and coming from residual \beta-FeSe in the melt. Moreover, the transition temperature (\sim10 K) is close to the T_{c} of \beta-FeSe (\sim8.5 K and up to \sim36.7 K at 8.9 GPa).[18] Thus a small drop at about 10 K might be ascribed to the residual amount of \beta-FeSe impurities.

The heat capacity C_{p} of the BaFe_{2}Se_{3} crystal approaches the classic value of 3NR at 300 K, where N is the atomic number in the chemical formula (N=6) and R is the gas constant (R=8.314 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}), consistent with the Dulong-Petit law (Fig. 6). At the low temperature, C_{p}(T) curve can be fitted solely by a cubic term \beta T^{3} times of Fig. 6). From the fitted value of \beta=1.357(6) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4}, the Debye temperature is estimated to be \Theta_{D}=205(1) K using the formula \Theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}NR/5\beta)^{1/3}. This is slightly smaller than \Theta_{D} of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}, which might be due to the larger atomic mass of Ba than K.[19] On the other hand, there is no \lambda-type anomaly for BaFe_{2}Se_{3} at the temperature of magnetic transitions (T_{N}=255 K). This can be ascribed to the overwhelming release of magnetic entropy due to existence of SRC above the long-range order at T_{N}.[10] This is also consistent with the absence of Curie-Weiss law in M(T) [Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)].

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we studied the physical properties of Ba_{1.004}Fe_{1.9(1)}Se_{3.1(t)} single crystals with 1D double chains of edge-shared Fe-Se tetrahedra parallel to the b axis. Composition analysis indicates that all crystallographic sites are fully occupied. XANES result shows that the valence of Fe is about 1.87+. Taken together with transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, this indicates that the BaFe_{2}Se_{3} is a semiconductor with a short-range AFM correlation at room temperature and a long-range AFM order below 255 K. The anisotropy of magnetization is consistent with magnetic structure determined from neutron results previously. This is rather similar to parent materials of Fe-based superconductors; however, the absence of appreciable conductivity coincides with the absence of connected infinite 2D Fe-Se planar tetrahedra.

# Anisotropy in BaFe_{2}Se_{3} single crystals with double chains of FeSe tetrahedra

Hechang Lei (^{\text{\text{\textregistered}}}^{\text double chains are separated by Ba^{2+} ions and are slightly tilted off the _bc_ plane. The tilting directions are opposite between the two neighboring layers as shown in Fig. 1(d). The shape of the BaFe_{2}Se_{3} crystal is long plate like. The XRD pattern of a BaFe_{2}Se_{3} crystal [Fig. 1(c)] reveals that the crystal surface is normal to the a axis with the plate-shaped surface parallel to the _bc_ plane. Moreover, the b axis is along the long direction of crystal in the _bc_ plane. The EDX spectrum of a single crystal confirms the presence of Ba, Fe, and Se. The average atomic ratios determined from EDX are Ba : Fe : Se = 1.00(4) : 1.9(1) : 3.1(1), close to the expected stoichiometric BaFe_{2}Se_{3} ratio. Hence there are no vacancies on either Ba or Fe sites, which is different from K_{x}Fe_{2-x}Se_{2}.[5, 13]

The features of Fe _K_-edge XANES spectrum of BaFe_{x}Se_{3} [Fig. 2(a)] are similar to FeSe_{x}.[14] The prepeak A (\sim7112.5 eV) is due to either dipole or quadrupole 1s\longrightarrow 3d transitions. The shoulder B with maximum absorption jump at \sim7118.4 eV can be ascribed to the 1s\longrightarrow 4p transition. When compared to the spectrum of FeO, the shoulder B is located at the lower energy side, suggesting that the valence of Fe is slightly smaller than 2+. The valence of Fe is evaluated by linear interpolation of the energy of BaFe_{2}Se_{3} with those of standards [Fe foil (metallic Fe), FeO (Fe^{2+}), and Fe_{2}O_{3} (Fe^{3+})]. From the peak of first-derivative spectra corresponding to the maximum absorption jump, we obtain \sim1.87+ for Fe valence, which is close to the value for FeSe_{x}.[14] On the other hand, there are two features for Se _K_-edge XANES spectrum of BaFe_{2}Se_{3} [Fig. 2(b)]. The feature C is mainly due to the 1s\longrightarrow 4p dipole transition and the broad hump D should be a multiple scattering of the photoelectron with the near neighbors.[15] By extrapolating the maximum absorption jumps of Se (\sim12659.2 eV) and CeO_{2} (\sim12662 eV),[14] we estimate \sim-1.98 for the Se valence, consistent with the formal value of Se ion (2-). For the Fe site, the nearest neighbors are four Se atoms [1\times Se(I), 2\times Se(II), and 1\times Se(III)] with four different distances close to \sim2.418 A and the next nearest neighbors are three Fe atoms with almost the same distance (\sim2.723 A).[8] From the joint analysis of Fe and Se edges, EXAFS data using a single bond distance for Fe-Se and Fe-Fe, and by fitting the k range 3.2-18.4 A^{-1} for Fe K edge and 2-14 A^{-1} for Se K edge [main panels and insets of Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)], the fitted average Fe-Se and Fe-Fe bond lengths are d_{\text{Fe-Se}}=2.428(5) A and d_{\text{Fe-Fe}}=2.71(5) A. This is consistent with the reported values.[8]

Temperature dependence of the resistivity \rho(T) of BaFe_{2}Se_{3} crystal for \mu_{0}H=0 and 9 T indicates that this material is a semiconductor in the measured temperature region (Fig. 3). The room-temperature value \rho(300\,\text{K}) is about 17 \Omega\,\text{cm}, which is much larger than in BaFe_{2}S_{3} (\sim0.35 \Omega\,\text{cm}).[16] Fits of the \rho(T) at high temperature using the thermal activation model \rho=\rho_{0}\exp(E_{a}/k_{B}T), where \rho_{0} is a prefactor, E_{a} is thermal activated energy, and k_{B} is Boltzmann's constant, gives E_{a}=0.178(1) eV in the temperature range above 170 K (inset in Fig. 3), which is also much larger than in BaFe_{2}S_{3}.[16, 17] The larger room-temperature resistivity and E_{a} can be ascribed to the increase of structural distortion which might localize the carriers and increase the band gap when compared to BaFe_{2}S_{3}.[8] For BaFe_{2}S_{3}, bond lengths are almost identical for all four Fe-S bonds, in contrast to very different bond lengths for BaFe_{2}Se_{3}. Moreover, the Fe-Fe bond distances in a single chain are identical for BaFe_{2}S_{3}, whereas they are different for BaFe_{2}Se_{3}, where the longer and shorter bonds alternately connect along the b axis. All structural features imply that in the former compound the coordination polyhedron is more symmetric than in the latter.

  It should be noted that the shorter Fe-Fe bond in BaFe_{2}S_{3} may also have some contribution to higher conductivity. On the other hand, when compared to BaFe_{2}S_{3}, which exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) below 25 K,[16] there is no obvious MR in BaFe_{2}Se_{3} as shown in Fig. 3.

Temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) of BaFe_{2}Se_{3} single crystal [Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)] cannot be fitted using Curie-Weiss law up to 390 K. It decreases with decreasing temperature for all field directions (H\|a, b, and c). It suggests that there is AFM interaction up to 390 K, in agreement with neutron results that found short-range correlations (SRC).[9, 10] Another characteristic in \chi(T) curves is a transition appearing at about 255 K for all three field directions, which is ascribed to a crossover from short-range AFM correlation to long-range AFM order.[9, 10] It should be noted that the absolute \chi_{a}(T) is much smaller than \chi_{b}(T) and \chi_{c}(T). Nevertheless, similar to H\,\|b, a Curie-like upturn in susceptibility is seen below 255 K for H\|c, while a faster drop is seen below 255 K for H\|a. It suggests that the easy axis of magnetization direction is a axis. According to mean-field theory for the collinear antiferromagnet, magnetic susceptibility along the easy-axis direction goes to zero for T\to 0, whereas perpendicular to the easy-axis magnetization direction is nearly constant below T_{N}. This is consistent with the neutron results.[9, 10] The small positive value of \chi_{a}(T\to 0) is probably due to the presence of a van Vleck paramagnetism. A large diversity of susceptibilities between H\|a, H\,\|b, and H\|c persisting up to 390 K suggests that there may be an intriguing anisotropy of SRC in the system. On the other hand, when the magnetic field was applied along the c axis, there is no obvious hysteresis between zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) measurements. The lack of hysteresis suggests that the ferromagnetic component of magnetic interactions between the Fe chains along the c axis is very weak. This can be ascribed to the large Fe-Fe (or ferromagnetic Fe4 plaquette) interchain distance (d_{\rm Fe-Fe}^{\rm interchain}\sim 6.441 A).[8] In contrast, for H\,\|b, the ZFC

  and FC measurements exhibit significant hysteresis due to the fact of short Fe-Fe (or ferromagnetic Fe4 plaquette) intrachain distance (d_{\text{Fe-Fe}}^{\text{intrachain}}\sim 2.720 and 2.727 A),[8] resulting in strong magnetic interaction. The hysteresis between the ZFC and FC curves extends up to 390 K, suggesting that this intrachain interaction exists at temperatures above the long-range order.

Isothermal M(H) for H\|a, H\|b, and H\|c [Figs. 4(d), 4(e), and 4(f)] at various temperatures show that there is no hysteresis for all three field directions, which confirms the AFM order in the system and excludes the ferromagnetic impurities. For H\|a, the slopes of M(H) increase with increasing temperature, but for the other two directions, M(H) curves are almost unchanged, consistent with the M(T) results. Moreover, the slopes of M(H) are H\|b>H\|c>H\|a for all of measured temperatures, corresponding to the increase of paramagnetic moment when magnetic field is rotated from a toward c and then toward the b axis, as shown Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c).

On the other hand, there is a small drop at about 10 K. This is also observed in a previous paper and might correspond to the superconducting transition.[9] In order to clarify whether this transition is extrinsic or intrinsic, we measured the other two samples from the same batch. As shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), sample B exhibits a similar drop at about 10 K for \mu_{0}H=0.1 mT and 0.1 T, but the superconducting volume fraction is only about 0.15% at 1.8 K for \mu_{0}H=0.1 mT. On the other hand, sample C does not show any drop below 15 K for \mu_{0}H=0.1 T. These results imply that this superconducting transition should be extrinsic and coming from residual \beta-FeSe in the melt. Moreover, the transition temperature (\sim10 K) is close to the T_{c} of \beta-FeSe (\sim8.5 K and up to \sim36.7 K at 8.9 GPa).[18] Thus a small drop at about 10 K might be ascribed to the residual amount of \beta-FeSe impurities.

The heat capacity C_{p} of the BaFe_{2}Se_{3} crystal approaches the classic value of 3NR at 300 K, where N is the atomic number in the chemical formula (N=6) and R is the gas constant (R=8.314 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}), consistent with the Dulong-Petit law (Fig. 6). At the low temperature, C_{p}(T) curve can be fitted solely by a cubic term \beta T^{3} times of Fig. 6). From the fitted value of \beta=1.357(6) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4}, the Debye temperature is estimated to be \Theta_{D}=205(1) K using the formula \Theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}NR/5\beta)^{1/3}. This is slightly smaller than \Theta_{D} of K_{x}Fe_{2-y}Se_{2}, which might be due to the larger atomic mass of Ba than K.[19] On the other hand, there is no \lambda-type anomaly for BaFe_{2}Se_{3} at the temperature of magnetic transitions (T_{N}=255 K). This can be ascribed to the overwhelming release of magnetic entropy due to existence of SRC above the long-range order at T_{N}.[10] This is also consistent with the absence of Curie-Weiss law in M(T) [Figs. 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)].

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we studied the physical properties of Ba_{1.004}Fe_{1.9(1)}Se_{3.1(t)} single crystals with 1D double chains of edge-shared Fe-Se tetrahedra parallel to the b axis. Composition analysis indicates that all crystallographic sites are fully occupied. XANES result shows that the valence of Fe is about 1.87+. Taken together with transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, this indicates that the BaFe_{2}Se_{3} is a semiconductor with a short-range AFM correlation at room temperature and a long-range AFM order below 255 K. The anisotropy of magnetization is consistent with magnetic structure determined from neutron results previously. This is rather similar to parent materials of Fe-based superconductors; however, the absence of appreciable conductivity coincides with the absence of connected infinite 2D Fe-Se planar tetrahedra.
