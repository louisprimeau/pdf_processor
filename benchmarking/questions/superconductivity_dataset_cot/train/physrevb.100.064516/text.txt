###### Abstract

We report the magnetization, the electrical resistivity, specific heat measurements, and band structure calculations of the layered superconductor SnTaS\({}_{2}\). The experiments are performed on single crystals grown by the chemical vapor transport method. The resistivity and magnetic susceptibility indicate that SnTaS\({}_{2}\) is a type-II superconductor with the transition temperature \(T_{c}=3\) K. The upper critical field (\(H_{c2}\)) shows large anisotropy for the magnetic field parallel to the \(ab\) plane (\(H//ab\)) and the \(c\) axis (\(H//c\)), and the temperature dependence of \(H_{c2}\) for \(H//ab\) shows an obvious unconventional upward feature at low temperature. The band structure of SnTaS\({}_{2}\) shows several band crossings near the Fermi level, which form three nodal lines in the \(k_{z}=0\) plane resulting in drumheadlike surface states when spin-orbit coupling is not considered. These results indicate that SnTaS\({}_{2}\) is a superconductor with a possible topological nodal line semimetal character.

## I Introduction

Superconductors with nontrivial band structure have attracted much attention due to the possibility of realizing some novel quantum states, such as topological superconductors and Majorana fermions [1, 2]. Nontrivial band structure has been found in both topological insulators and topological semimetals [1, 3, 4, 5]. Topological semimetals can be further classified according to the configuration of band crossing near the Fermi level, including Dirac semimetals, Weyl semimetals, nodal line semimetals, etc. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Superconductivity can be combined with the novel band structure by charge carrier doping or applying external pressure on topological materials. For example, the topological insulator Bi\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{3}\) has been found to be superconducting when intercalated by Cu, Sr, or Nb atoms [12, 13, 14] or subjected to high pressure [15]. The Dirac semimetal Cd\({}_{3}\)As\({}_{2}\) and the type-II Weyl semimetal WTe\({}_{2}\) can be induced as superconductors under high pressure [16, 17, 18]. Besides, some topological materials themselves are superconductors. The type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe\({}_{2}\) has a superconducting transition with \(T_{c}=0.1\) K, and the \(T_{c}\) can be dramatically enhanced to 8.2 K with high pressure [19]. PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) has been found to be a superconducting topological nodal line semimetal with a noncentrosymmetric structure [20, 21]. The later category of aforementioned superconductors does not suffer topological state shift from charge carrier doping or high pressure, providing an excellent playground for researching superconductivity with nontrivial band topology.

The layered compound SnTaS\({}_{2}\), which is isoelectronic with PbTaSe\({}_{2}\), is another superconductor identified as early as 1973 [22]. Although the critical temperature for SnTaS\({}_{2}\) (\(T_{c}=2.8\) K) has been reported [22, 23], more detailed superconducting properties are still unknown. Moreover, we notice that SnTaS\({}_{2}\) has a centrosymmetric structure, which is different from that of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\). Whether the centrosymmetric SnTaS\({}_{2}\) can host the topological nontrivial band structure is also unknown. In this paper, we have systemically investigated the superconducting properties and the electronic structure of SnTaS\({}_{2}\). The magnetization, electric transport, and specific heat properties are studied in detail on the single crystal samples. We find large anisotropy in the upper critical field and coherence length. The temperature dependence of the upper critical field has an obvious upward feature for the magnetic field parallel to the \(ab\) plane. Analysis of the specific heat shows that SnTaS\({}_{2}\) is a moderately coupled superconductor. Using first-principles calculations, we find that centrosymmetric SnTaS\({}_{2}\) exhibits a topological nodal line band structure when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is not included. It features three nodal lines centering the K point near the Fermi level, along with drumheadlike surface states corresponding to them. These properties are similar to those of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\). Our work suggests that SnTaS\({}_{2}\) is another system for investigating the novel properties of superconductors with topological nodal-line fermions.

## II Experiment and Methods

The single crystals of SnTaS\({}_{2}\) were grown by the chemical vapor transport method with iodine as the transport agent. Polycrystalline Sn\({}_{0.33}\)TaS\({}_{2}\) was synthesized previously by the  solid state reaction of Sn, Ta, and S powders in an evacuated quartz tube at 850 degC. The obtained Sn0.33TaS2 polycrystals were mixed with Sn powders with an element ratio of Sn:Ta:S = 1.2:1:2 and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube together with iodine (3 mg/cm3 in concentration). The excess Sn was used to restrain the appearance of Sn0.33TaS2. The quartz tube was then put into a two-zone furnace with 1000 degC in the hot zone and 970 degC in the cold zone for 2 weeks. Thin plate-shaped single crystals were obtained with typical dimensions of \(3\times 3\times 0.05\) mm3. The crystal structure of the obtained crystals was characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku Smartlab x-ray diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation at room temperature. The atomic ratio was determined by Oxford energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis. The magnetization, resistivity, and specific heat of the samples were measured using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System.

The band structure calculations were performed based on the density functional theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna _ab initio_ simulation package (vasp) [24]. The generalized gradient approximation with the realization of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional was adopted for the exchange-correlation potential [25]. The cutoff energy was set to be 450 eV and the Brillouin zone was sampled with a \(13\times 13\times 5\)\(\Gamma\)-centered \(k\) mesh. The energy convergence criterion was chosen to be \(10^{-6}\) eV. The surface states were computed by using the Wannier_tools package [26].

## III Results and Discussion

SnTaS2 has a layered hexagonal structure (space group \(P6_{3}/mmc\)) with the lattice parameters \(a=b=3.309\) A and \(c=17.450\) A. The layered structure is formed by the alternative stacking of TaS2 and Sn layers, as shown in Fig. 1(a). It should be noted that SnTaS2 preserves the inversion and twofold screw rotation symmetries. Figure 1(b) is the XRD pattern of the maximum surface of a platelike single crystal. All of the peaks can be indexed as the (00\(l\)) reflections of SnTaS2, indicating the single crystals perfectly oriented along the \(c\) axis. The crystals can be further confirmed as SnTaS2 by powder XRD and EDX measurements.

Figure 1(c) displays the typical temperature dependence of the resistivity for SnTaS2 single crystals with current applied in the _ab_ plane. The resistivity shows a metallic behavior and the residual resistivity ratio RRR = \(\rho\)(300 K)/\(\rho\)(4 K) is as high as 380, indicating the high quality of the samples. The linear temperature dependence of the resistivity at high temperature suggests the dominance of electron-phonon scattering. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c), the resistivity has a sharp superconducting transition, and the critical temperature \(T_{c}\) can be determined as 3.0 K using the criterion of the 50% point on the transition curve. To further demonstrate the superconductivity of the samples, we measured the dc susceptibility in the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) processes with a magnetic field of 10 Oe parallel to the _ab_ plane, as displayed in Fig. 1(d). The demagnetization effect is not considered due to the thin plate-shaped sample with the magnetic field parallel to the sample plane. The \(T_{c}\) determined from the susceptibility curve is about 2.97 K, close to that determined from resistivity data. The superconducting shielding volume fraction at 1.8 K is close to 100%. In addition, the FC curve is not coincident with the ZFC curve, suggesting a type-II superconductor. However, the FC curve is not much larger than the ZFC curve, indicating few vortices pinning.

To estimate the anisotropic lower critical field (\(H_{c1}\)), the zero-field-cooled magnetization \(M(H)\) curves were measured with H//_ab_ and H//_c_, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(c), respectively. The values of \(H_{c1}\) are determined as the points for \(M(H)\) deviating 5% from the linear fitted curves. To get the accurate values of \(H_{c1}\), the demagnetization effect should be considered. For a perfectly diamagnetic superconductor, the magnetic field lines are excluded from the inside of the sample and have higher density on the outside. This makes a higher field that the sample feels around it and a more pronounced diamagnetization slope, i.e., \(M/H_{a}=-1/(1-N)\), where \(N\) is the demagnetization factor. For the thin plate-shaped sample, \(N\) is almost 0 for the magnetic field parallel to the sample's surface and is nearly 1 when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the surface. Thus, for the thin SnTaS2 plates, the \(H_{c1}\) for \(H//ab\) (\(H_{c1}^{ab}\)) can be determined directly from the magnetization curves without demagnetization correction, as shown in Fig. 2(b). By contrast, the demagnetization correction cannot be neglected when we determine the \(H_{c1}\) for \(H//c\) (\(H_{c1}^{c}\)). To calculate the demagnetization factor \(N\), we employ the following relation [27]:

\[N = 1-1/\Big{(}1+q_{\text{disk}}\frac{a}{c}\Big{)},\] (1) \[q_{\text{disk}} = \frac{4}{3\pi} + \frac{2}{3\pi}\tanh\Big{[}1.27\frac{c}{a}\ln\Big{(}1+\frac{a}{c} \Big{)}\Big{]},\] (2)

(c) The temperature dependence of the resistivity with current flowing in the _ab_ plane. The straight dashed line is the guide to the linear behavior of the resistivity in high temperature. The inset shows the superconducting transition of resistivity. (d) The zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) magnetic susceptibility curves measured with a magnetic field of 10 Oe and parallel to the _ab_ plane.

  where \(a\) and \(c\) are the dimension perpendicular to the magnetic field and the thickness of the sample, respectively. Here, the demagnetization correction has been considered in determining the values of \(H_{c1}^{c}\) in Fig. 2(d) with \(N\approx 0.9473\). Both the \(H_{c1}^{c}\) and the \(H_{c1}^{ab}\) data can be fitted using \(H_{c1}(T)=H_{c1}(0)[1-(T/T_{c})^{2}]\). The lower critical fields at zero temperature for the two directions are \(H_{c1}^{ab}(0)=53.5\) Oe and \(H_{c1}^{c}(0)=81.7\) Oe, respectively.

The low-temperature resistivity under various magnetic fields with \(H//c\) and \(H//ab\) are presented in Figs. 3(a) and 3(c), respectively. The superconducting transition is very sharp for the zero-field curve and is broaden lightly by the applied fields. With the 50% criterion to determine the transition temperatures, the upper critical fields for \(H//c\) (\(H_{c2}^{c}\)) and \(H//ab\) (\(H_{c2}^{ab}\)) as the functions of temperature are given in Figs. 3(b) and 3(d), respectively. The temperature dependence of \(H_{c2}^{c}\) can be well fitted with the Ginzberg-Landau (GL) equation \(H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)(1-t^{2})/(1+t^{2})\), where \(t=T/T_{c}\). The upper critical field at \(T=0\) K for \(H//c\) is accordingly estimated as \(H_{c2}^{c}(0)=203.6\) Oe. For \(H//ab\), the temperature dependence of \(H_{c2}^{ab}\) has an obvious upward feature and deviates from the GL equation for \(T<2.5\) K. This upward feature for \(H_{c2}^{ab}(T)\) is also found in PbTaSe\({}_{2}\)[20, 28, 29, 30], where the upper critical field can be roughly fitted by the equation \(H_{c2}(T)=H_{c2}(0)(1-t^{3/2})^{3/2}\). However, the fitting curve using this formula is also lower than the \(H_{c2}^{ab}(T)\) data in the low-temperature region [Fig. 3(d)], indicating the upward feature in SnTaS\({}_{2}\) is more obvious than that of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\).

The enhancement of \(H_{c2}\) at low temperatures has several possible origins, such as (i) dimensional crossover [31], (ii) the presence of impurities and disorder [32, 33], (iii) the multiband effect [34], (iv) the melting of the vortex lattice associate with quantum critical point [35], and (v) the non-local effect in the clean limit [36]. The dimensional crossover means that the superconductor changes from a bulk superconductor to a stacked array of two-dimensional superconducting layers with the coherence length perpendicular to the layers (\(\xi_{c}\)) getting smaller than the distance between adjacent layers with decreasing temperature. This theory has been used to explain the upward curvature in \(H_{c2}^{ab}(T)\) of organic-molecules-intercalated \(2H\)-TaS\({}_{2}\)[37, 38], in which the \(H_{c2}^{ab}\)'s can exceed the Pauli paramagnetic limit at moderate temperatures and the coherence lengths are comparable with the TaS\({}_{2}\) layer distance. In our case, the \(H_{c2}^{ab}\) is much smaller than the Pauli paramagnetic limiting field (\(\mu_{0}H_{P}=5.5\) T) down to 1.8 K, and the \(\xi_{c}\) is much larger than the layer distance (see below). These facts demonstrate that the layers in SnTaS\({}_{2}\) are not decoupled and it is a bulk superconductor. On the other hand, the high value of RRR = 380 indicates the high quality and low density of defects in our samples. This excludes the possibility of the scattering by impurities and supports the nonlocal effect scenario. The current properties of SnTaS\({}_{2}\) show no trace for the quantum critical point. The result of DFT computations discussed later shows that several bands cross the Fermi level. Therefore, the multiband effect and the nonlocal effect are the most likely origins for the upward curvature of \(H_{c2}^{ab}(T)\).

To estimate \(H_{c2}^{ab}(0)\), we try to fit the \(H_{c2}^{ab}(T)\) data using the equation for a two-band superconductor [34], i.e.,

\[a_{0}[\ln t+U(t)][\ln t+U(\eta h)]+a_{1}[\ln t+U(h)]\] \[+\ a_{2}[\ln t+U(\eta h)]=0,\] (3)

(b) The temperature dependence of the upper critical field extracted from the resistivity curves with \(H//c\). The data are fitted by the GL equation. (d) The temperature dependence of the upper critical field extracted from the resistivity curves with \(H//ab\). The data are fitted by three different equations.

The dashed lines are the linear fit to the 2 K curves in the low-field range.

The demagnetization correction is considered in \(H_{c1}^{c}\).

  where \(t=T/T_{c}\), \(h=\frac{H_{c}D_{1}}{2\omega_{D}T}\), \(\eta=\frac{D_{1}}{D_{1}}\), \(U(x)=\psi(x+\frac{1}{2})-\psi(\frac{1}{2})\), \(a_{0}=2(\lambda_{11}\lambda_{22}-\lambda_{12}\lambda_{21})/\lambda_{0}\), \(a_{1}=1+(\lambda_{11}-\lambda_{22})/\lambda_{0}\), \(a_{2}=1-(\lambda_{11}-\lambda_{22})/\lambda_{0}\), and \(\lambda_{0}=\sqrt{(\lambda_{11}-\lambda_{22})^{2}+4\lambda_{12}

  SnTaS\({}_{2}\) are in the range of 15-180 meV, which are comparable with typical nodal line materials such as TiB\({}_{2}\), Cu\({}_{3}\)PdN, Mg\({}_{3}\)Bi\({}_{2}\), and CaAgAs [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. From Figs. 5(b) and 5(f), we can observe several electronlike and holelike bands cross the Fermi level, consistent with the multiband scenario which is a possible origin for the upward curvature of \(H_{c2}^{ab}(T)\) in our samples. The density of states at the Fermi level calculated from the band structure is 1.04 states eV\({}^{-1}\) per formula unit with SOC, in good agreement with the value obtained from specific heat measurements.

It is interesting that, similar to PbTaSe\({}_{2}\), SnTaS\({}_{2}\) is also a superconducting nodal line semimetal, which is isoelectronic with but not isostructural with PbTaSe\({}_{2}\). Although they have similar electronic structures, the nodal lines in these two materials come from different origins. The nodal lines in non-centrosymmetric PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) are protected by mirror reflection symmetry [21], while the nodal lines in SnTaS\({}_{2}\) are protected by time-reversal and inversion symmetries. The different symmetries cause that, when SOC is considered, the nodal lines are persistent in PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) but gapped in SnTaS\({}_{2}\)[21]. These properties in common with and differing from those of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) make SnTaS\({}_{2}\) a great platform to further investigate the properties of superconducting nodal line semimetals.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, we report the magnetic, transport, and specific heat properties and the electronic structure of the centrosymmetric compound SnTaS\({}_{2}\), which is a layered type-II superconductor. Large anisotropy is found in the upper critical field and the GL coherence length. An obvious upward curvature is observed in the upper critical field curve for \(H//ab\), maybe due to the multiband effect or the nonlocal effect, which needs further investigation to clarify. The electron-phonon coupling constant is determined to be 0.66, indicating a moderately coupled superconductor. The band structure of SnTaS\({}_{2}\) exhibits three nodal lines in the \(k_{z}=0\) plane near the Fermi level with drumheadlike surface states. With a crystal structure similar to that of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) but symmetries different from those of noncentrosymmetric PbTaSe\({}_{2}\), SnTaS\({}_{2}\) is considered a promising system to research the novel properties of superconducting topological nodal line semimetals.
