 at x=0-0.15, and superconducting Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is produced at x=0.1-0.15[21].

The finding of superconductivity in metal-doped Bi_{2}Se_{3} is exciting from two scientific points of view. First is that the behavior of T_{\rm c} against pressure means the discovery of pressure-driven T_{\rm c} enhancement, which suggests a different type of superconducting pairing from that predicted by BCS theory. The second point, which may be more significant, is that the superconductivity may be categorized as "topological superconductivity" characterized by odd parity pairing such as p-wave pairing. The temperature dependence of the reduced upper critical field, h^{*}, fits well with the p-wave polar model, suggesting that Sr_{0.062}Bi_{2}Se_{3} could be a topological superconductor. Our group also reported pressure-driven superconductivity in Ag-doped Bi_{2}Se_{3}, where Ag atom is substituted for Bi, i.e., Ag_{x}Bi_{2-x}Se_{3}[24]; recent work using both photoelectron and x-ray fluorescence holography suggested the intercalation of Ag in the space between Se layers, as well as substitution. No superconductivity was confirmed in Ag_{0.05}Bi_{1.95}Se_{3}, which is the nominal stoichiometry, at ambient pressure, and superconductivity suddenly appeared at 11 GPa. Two superconducting phases appeared in phase II (space group No. 12, _C2/m_) and phase III (space group No. 139, _I4/mmm_), which transform successively from phase I (space group No. 166, _R3m_) with applied pressure. Topological superconductivity was also suggested for Ag_{0.05}Bi_{1.95}Se_{3} from the temperature dependence of h^{*}.

Based on the above scientific background, we pursued pressure-driven superconductivity in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} in which the electronic states can be precisely tuned through x and y[15]. Firstly, the crystal structures of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0,\,0.25,\,0.5,\,1.0, and y=1.0) in a wide pressure range of 0-30 GPa were clarified using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) with synchrotron radiation. Secondly, the temperature dependence of resistance (R) in the above samples was investigated at 0-15 GPa. Consequently, the successful observation of superconductivity under pressure was achieved for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0,\,0.25,\,0.5,\,1.0, and y=1.0) samples. The T_{\rm c}-pressure (p) phase diagram was drawn for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. Thirdly, the topological nature of pressure-driven superconductivity was investigated from temperature dependence of h^{*} at high pressure. Finally, the correlation between electronic states and superconductivity was discussed.

## II Experimental

### Sample preparation and characterization at ambient pressure

Crystals of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0,\,0.25,\,0.5,\,1.0, and y=1.0) were grown by a conventional melt-growth method using stoichiometric amounts of Bi, Sb, Te, and Se powders, using the following process: the powders were sealed in a quartz tube which was heated at 850 ^{\circ}C for 24 h, then slowly cooled down to 550 ^{\circ}C at a rate of 6 ^{\circ}C/h, and then quenched with ice water. The obtained crystals showed a clear basal plane structure. More details are shown in Supplemental Material, and the XRD patterns of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=1.0,\,y=1.0) are shown in Fig. S1 to show the high sample quality [25].

The energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectra of the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples were recorded with an EDX spectrometer equipped with a scanning electron microscope (KEYENCE VE-9800-EDAX Genesis XM2). The EDX spectra were measured for 5-10 different positions of the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} crystals at room temperature. From the EDX spectra, the chemical compositions of all samples were determined (results are given in Table 1).

The crystal structure at ambient pressure was determined by single-crystal XRD measurement of all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} crystals, which were obtained by cutting off a small piece (\sim100-\mum scale) of the crystals, using a Rigaku Saturn 724 diffractometer equipped with a Mo K\alpha source (wavelength \lambda=0.710\,73\,A); the measurement was performed at 100 K.

### Measurements of XRD and R-T plot under pressure

Powder XRD patterns of the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples were measured under pressure at 297 K, using synchrotron radiation at BL12B2 of SPring-8; the wavelength \lambda of the x-ray beam was 0.6853 A. The powder sample obtained by grinding the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} crystal was used for the powder XRD measurement. A diamond-anvil cell (DAC) was used for the high-pressure XRD measurement, with the powder sample loaded into the hole of a stainless-steel plate. Daphne 7373 was used as the pressure medium for XRD measurement under high pressure. The pressure was determined by monitoring ruby fluorescence.

The DC magnetic susceptibility (M/H) of the small crystal (1-mm scale) of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} was recorded by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2) at ambient pressure (0 GPa). M and H refer to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. In this SQUID magnetometer, the M/H measurement can be made down to 2.0 K. The temperature dependence of R of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} was measured in four-terminal measurement mode under pressure. The small Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} flake was introduced into the DAC in air because this sample is not air sensitive. The sample was loaded directly on a Kapton sheet/epoxy resin/rhenium in the DAC; six Cu electrodes were attached to the Kapton sheet, and this cell was used for measuring the R of the sample. NaCl was used as the pressure medium. The applied pressure was determined by monitoring ruby fluorescence.

The R was measured at 300-1.5 K in standard four-terminal measurement mode using an Oxford superconducting magnet system. The temperature was precisely controlled using an Oxford Instruments MercuryiTC; the minimum temperature is 1.5 K in this equipment. The H was controlled using Oxford Instruments MercuryiPS. Electric current (I) was supplied by a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the exact value of I was monitored by an Advantest R-8240 digital electrometer. The voltage (V) was measured by an Agilent 34420 digital nanovoltmeter.

## III Results and Discussion

### Physical properties of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} at ambient pressure

Optical images of the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0,\,0.25,\,0.5,1.0; y=1.0) crystals are shown in Fig. 1(a). Bright basal  planes were observed in all crystals. Only peaks ascribable to Bi, Sb, Te, and Se atoms were observed in the EDX spectra, as seen from Fig. 1(b), indicating no contamination by impurities. The averaged stoichiometry determined from the EDX spectrum is listed in Table 1. The determined x values are almost consistent with the nominal values in all samples, and the determined y value deviates from the nominal value (_y_ = 1.0). The single crystals are homogeneous in stoichiometry, because the estimated standard deviations (esd's) in x and y are small. The lowering of the Fermi level and the raising of the Dirac point against x were confirmed from the ARPES (not shown), in the same manner as those previously reported [15]. As an example, the ARPES of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (_x_ = 0.25) is shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplemental Material [25]; this sample's chemical composition is "Bi1.75(4)Sb0.25(4)Te1.89(7)Se1.11(7)" as later described.

The crystal structure determined by single-crystal diffraction at ambient pressure was rhombohedral (space group No. 166: R3_m_) for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}, which is consistent with that of Bi_{2}Se_{3}[26] and with that previously determined for Bi_{2}Te_{2}Se [27,28]. The lattice constants, a and c, determined are listed in Table 1, and the atomic coordinates are listed in Table 1 in Supplemental Material [25]. The lattice constants are close to those of Bi_{2}Se_{3} (4.18 and 28.7 A) [26]. The values of a and c increase slowly with increasing x, but maximum c value is recorded at x = 0.5. Here it is noticed that the y value [= 1.32(6)] at x = 0.5 determined from EDX is larger than those (\sim1.2) at x = 0, 0.25, and 1.0. From this result, it may be concluded that the increase in y causes the expansion of the unit cell. The stoichiometry for each Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} sample determined from single-crystal XRD is listed in Table 1. The stoichiometry determined from single-crystal XRD is almost consistent with that from EDX. Thus, the stoichiometry determined from EDX is reliable. Throughout this paper, the stoichiometry determined from EDX is employed for each Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} sample. Crystallographic data of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples are listed in Table S1 of Supplemental Material [25].

Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show temperature dependence of R and magnetic susceptibility (_M/H_) for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te1.81(2)Se1.2(2) prepared as Bi_{2}Te_{2}Se (i.e., nominal x of 0; nominal y of 1.0 for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}, respectively, measured at 2.73 GPa and ambient pressure (0 GPa), where M and H refer to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. No superconductivity is observed near ambient pressure, as seen from Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). The _R_-_T_ plot [Fig. 1(c)] at 2.73 GPa substantially shows metallic behavior. Strictly speaking, the R saturates at higher temperature than 200 K. This behavior may be due to the fact that the Fermi level does not match the bulk conduction band, but crosses the bottom of the conduction band or the top of surface states [15]. The _M/H_-_T_ plots for other Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples (i.e., nominal x = 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0; nominal y = 1.0) did not show any superconducting transition at low pressure (not shown). Thus, all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples are not superconductors at ambient pressure.

### Pressure dependence of crystal structure of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}

Figures 2(a)-2(d) show XRD patterns of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples under pressure up to 29 GPa. As seen from Fig. 2(a), the XRD patterns of Bi_{2.1(1)}Te1.8(2)Se1.2(2) at 2.4-29 GPa show the presence of three different phases (phase I, phase II, and phase III) which were assigned to rhombohedral (space group No. 166, R3_m_), monoclinic (space group No. 12, C2/_m_), and 9/10-fold monoclinic (space group No. 12, C2/_m_), respectively. These crystal structures are shown in

Figure 1: (a) Optical image and (b) EDX spectrum of a crystal-like lump of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (_x_ = 0.25 and y = 1.0). (c) _R_–_T_ plot and (d) _M/H_–_T_ plot of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (nominal x = 0 and y = 1.0) recorded at 2.73 and 0 GPa, respectively.

  Fig. 3. The crystal structures of phase I and phase II are the same as those previously determined [27,28]. However, the crystal structure of phase III is different from those reported in Refs. [27] and [28], and was the same as that for Bi_{2}Te_{3} and Bi_{2}Se_{3} reported in Refs. [29] and [30]. In this study, we performed Le Bail fitting for the XRD pattern based on various space groups suggested for Bi_{2}Te_{3}[29,31,32], Bi_{2}Se_{3}[30,33,34,35,36,37], Sb_{5}Se_{3}[38,39], and Sb_{2}Te_{3}[40,41,42,43], and Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}[27,28,44,45], and the experimental XRD pattern of Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)} for each phase was most exactly fitted by the above space group: rhombohedral structure (space group No. 166, R\bar{3}m) for phase I, monoclinic structure (space group No. 12, C2/m) for phase II, and 9/10-fold monoclinic structure (space group No. 12, C2/m) for phase III).

For showing the quality of fit between experimental and calculated XRD pattern in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}, the experimental XRD patterns of Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)} at 2.37, 14.4, and 28.6 GPa are shown in Fig. S3 [25], with the patterns calculated by Le Bail fitting. All XRD peaks are well fitted, as seen from Fig. S3 [25]. The values of weighted pattern R factor (wR_{\rm p}), pattern R factor (R_{\rm p}), and \chi^{2} in the Le Bail fitting were 2.98%, 1.48%, and 0.921 for 2.37 GPa; 2.13%, 1.15%, and 0.743 for 14.4 GPa; and 1.60%, 0.96%, and 0.449 for 28.6 GPa. The values of wR_{\rm p} and R_{\rm p} in the Le Bail fitting for pressure-dependent XRD patterns were less than 3% for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, less than 4% for Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.8(9)}Te_{1.1(7)}, less than 7.0% for Bi_{1.5(3)}Sb_{0.5(3)}Te_{1.6(8)}Se_{1.3(26)}, and less than 4.5% for Bi_{1.08(9)}Sb_{0.91(18)}Te_{1.8(1)}Se_{1.1(9)}, indicating the good fit between the experimental and calculated XRD patterns.

In this study, we partly performed Rietveld refinement for XRD patterns at 2.37 GPa (phase I), 14.4 GPa (phase II), and 28.6 GPa (phase III) for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, less than 4% for Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.8(9)}Te_{1.1(7)}, less than 7.0% for Bi_{1.5(3)}Sb_{0.5(3)}Te_{1.6(8)}Se_{1.3(26)}, and less than 4.5% for Bi_{1.08(9)}Sb_{0.91(18)}Te_{1.8(1)}Se_{1.1(9)}, indicating the solidity of the space group suggested for each phase; the values of wR_{\rm p}, R_{\rm p}, and \chi^{2} in the Rietveld analyses were 3.21%, 1.83%, and 1.06, for 2.37 GPa; 2.40%, 1.81%, and 0.938 for 14.4 GPa; and 1.36%, 1.00%, and 0.320 for 28.6 GPa. The lattice constants determined by Rietveld refinement are the same as those determined by L De Bail fitting. The lattice constants and atomic coordinates determined in the Rietveld analyses are listed in Table S2 [25].

The first and second structural phase transitions are observed at 8.36 and 15.4 GPa, respectively, for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}. Actually, it is noticed that multiple phases exist around the above pressures. Namely, phase I still remains even above 8.36 GPa, although phase II emerges at 8.36 GPa. Only phase II is found from 13.3 GPa. Such a coexistence of multiple phases (phase II and phase III) is observed at 15.4-18.9 GPa, and a single phase (phase III) exists from 22.5 GPa. As a consequence, the structural transition is not sharp but broad, i.e., pressure width of a few GPa is observed for the complete structural transition. For a simple understanding of the evolution of structure against pressure, a schematic representation is given in Fig. 4(a). In addition, our results on crystal structures for phase I and phase II are consistent with those reported previously for Bi_{2}Te_{2}Se [27,28,45], and the crystal structure for phase III is different from those (space group No.229, Im3m[27], space group No.139, I4/mmm[28,45]) reported previously. However, our suggested structure (space group No. 12, C2/m) provided the better fit between the experimental and calculated XRD patterns both in Le Bail fitting and Rietveld refinement.

Figure 2: Pressure-dependent powder XRD patterns of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}, with nominal x values of (a) 0, (b) 0.25, (c) 0.5, and (d) 1.0; nominal y value is 1.0 for all samples. Measurement temperature and pressure are 297 K and 0–30 GPa, respectively.

  In addition, the monoclinic structure (space group No. 12, _C2/m_) corresponds to the distorted structure of the above body-centered cubic structure (space group No.229, _Im3m_), or body-centered tetragonal structure (space group No.139, _IA/mmm_).

As seen from the XRD patterns shown in Figs. 2(b)-2(d), Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.80(7)}Se_{1.11(7)}, Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)} Se_{1.32(6)}, and Bi_{1.08(9)}Sb_{0.91(8)}Te_{1.81(3)}Se_{1.19(3)} have four different phases (phase I, phase II, phase II', and phase III) for each sample under pressure up to 30 GPa; the nominal x and y values for the above samples are listed in Table 1. Here, it should be noticed that phase II' is additionally observed although only three phases are found in Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.80(2)}Se_{1.2(2)} [Fig. 2(a)]. The crystal structures of main phases, phase I, phase II, and phase III, are the same as those in Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}. The crystal structure of phase II' was assigned to monoclinic structure (space group No. 15, _C2/c_). The atomic coordinates and lattice constants in the monoclinic structures of phase II, phase II', and phase III are different from each other [28], and as described later, the discontinuous change of lattice constants and volume is observed between monoclinic phases. The pressures for transitions of phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III were 9.06 and 15.9 GPa for Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.80(7)}Se_{1.11(7)}, respectively. The pressures were 10.0 and 18.7 GPa for Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)}Se_{1.32(6)}, and 11.2 and 22.3 GPa for Bi_{1.089(3)}Sb_{0.91(18)}Te_{1.81(3)}Se_{1.19(3)}; the crystal phases determined for phase I and phase II are the same as those reported previously for Bi_{1.5}Sb_{0.5}Te_{1.8}Se_{1.2} [Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0.5)] [45], indicating the reliability of our crystal data. However, our suggested crystal structure for phase III (space group No. 12, _C2/m_) is different from that reported previously (space group No.139, _IA/mmm_[45]). Our suggested crystal structure provided the better fit between experimental and calculated XRD patterns as in Bi_{2}Te_{2}Se. No crystal data under pressure have been reported for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0.25 and 1.0).

In the same manner as Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.82(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, multiple phases exist around the above pressures, as seen from Figs. 2(b)-2(d) and Fig. 4(a). Figure 4(b) shows the pressures causing structural phase transitions (phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III) for each sample. Both pressures for phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III monotonically increase with an increase in x, i.e., amount of Sb. Actually, as seen from Figs. 2(b)-2(d), phases II' emerges together with phase II and/or phase III in the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{x}, samples other than Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, and still exists even in phase III; the schematic representation of phases against pressure is shown in Fig. 4(a).

The lattice constants (a and c) against pressure for the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples are shown in Figs. S5(a)-S5(d) [25]. The discontinuous change of lattice constants is observed with each structural transition, indicating the first-order transition. The _V/Z_ value monotonously decreases with an increase in pressure (Fig. 5), and discontinuous changes (sudden drop) are observed at the pressures corresponding to structural transitions [Figs. 5(a)-5(d)]; the Z is the number of asymmetry units in each crystal lattice, and _V/Z_ corresponds to the volume per a Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. As seen from Figs. 5(a)-5(d), two or three phases coexist at a part of the region in phase II and phase III. Moreover, the ratios of lattice constants at each pressure with respect to that at minimum pressure in each phase (phase I, phase II, and phase III) of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{2}Se (x=0.25) are illustrated in Figs. S6-S8, indicating an extremely small anisotropy for contraction against pressure in all phases. Admittedly, the _c/c_(0.41 GPa) is slightly smaller than _a/a_(0.41 GPa) in phase I, but the difference is within 2% 10 GPa the peak broadening may take place. Nevertheless, the lattice constants and V were definitely determined with very small ed's up to 30 GPa, indicating the structural parameters obtained are reliable.

### Pressure dependence of physical properties of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}

Figure 6(a) shows the temperature dependence of R in Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.82(2)}Se_{1.1(2)} at different pressures, where

Figure 4: (a) Schematic representation of evolution of crystal structure against pressure, and (b) x dependence of pressure causing structural transitions (phase I to phase II, and phase II to phase III) in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}.

  R/R(10 K) is plotted, i.e., the R is normalized at 10 K so that all data obtained in the different measurements can be reasonably compared. The R/R(10 K)-T plots at 0-2 GPa show no superconductivity down to 1.5 K in increasing pressure, while a clear superconducting transition appears above 2.5 GPa which is in phase I. Figure 6(b) shows the T_{\text{c}}-p plot in Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, in which the T_{\text{c}} values are determined from the R/R(10 K)-T plots at different pressures shown in Fig. 6(a). As seen from Fig. 6(b), the T_{\text{c}} monotonically increases with an increase in pressure. No significant variation in T_{\text{c}}-p plot is observed at the structural transition of phase I to phase II. Here, we comment that a complete disappearance of R drop for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples is clearly confirmed under H as high as several tesla. These results indicate that the R drop originates from the superconducting transition. Examples of H dependence of R/R(10 K)-T plots under pressure are shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(c), as described later. We must briefly comment on nonvanishing R at the superconducting state in the R/R(10 K)-T plots (Figs. 6 and 7). As seen from Figs. 6(a), 7(a), and 7(c), the complete zero resistance (zero-R) even in the superconducting state is not observed because of polycrystallinity of the sample employed in resistance measurement under pressure, i.e., the resistance at grain boundaries between single crystals provides nonvanishing R in the superconducting state.

Figure 6(b) shows the T_{\text{c}}-p plots in the other Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples (Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.89(7)}Se_{1.11(7)}, Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)}Se_{1.32(6)}, and Bi_{1.089(8)}Sb_{0.91(8)}Te_{1.81(3)}Se_{1.19(3)}). The T_{\text{c}} value was determined from the cross point between R drop and R-T plot in the normal state, as seen from Fig. S9(a) in Supplemental Material [25]. All samples show no superconductivity at low pressures below 3 GPa, and the superconductivity emerged in phase I. The T_{\text{c}} increases with an increase in pressure, and any discontinuous variation is not observed at structural phase transition (phase I to phase II), as seen from Fig. 6(b). Actually, the T_{\text{c}} for Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)}Se_{1.32(6)} rapidly and continuously increases at 10 GPa, at which the phase II appears. When decreasing pressure, the superconductivity of the above samples could be kept down to lower pressure than the pressure at which the superconductivity emerges in increasing pressure (or onset pressure), indicating the presence of hysteresis in the T_{\text{c}}-p plot. The behavior of T_{\text{c}} against pressure is similar in all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples, inclusive of Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.82(2)}Se_{1.1(2)}. The pressure at which the superconductivity emerges and the maximum T_{\text{c}} for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples are listed in Table 2; the maximum T_{\text{c}} of 5.45 K is recorded at 13.5 GPa for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.82(2)}Se_{1.1(2)} in the pressure range of 0-15 GPa. The T_{\text{c}} values for all samples still increase in the pressure range achieved in this study, and each T_{\text{c}} continuously varies at phase I and phase II, indicating that the density of states (DOS) on the Fermi level may increase with a shrinkage of lattice volume, although the behavior cannot simply be explained. To clarify the mechanism of the increase in T_{\text{c}} against pressure more, a theoretical evaluation of electronic

  states of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} under pressure was performed for three selected structures, indicating the enhancement of DOS with increasing pressure (Figs. S10-S12 [25]). Namely, the increase in T_{\rm c} against pressure may be due to the DOS enhancement. In addition, the Hall-effect measurement under pressure may be efficient to experimentally confirm the change of carrier density and DOS, which may be a future task.

Here, we must consider why superconductivity for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} emerged in phase I, different from Bi_{2}Se_{3} and Ag-doped Bi_{2}Se_{3} in which superconductivity appeared in phase II [24,37]. This result seems to be quite strange. However, it should be noticed that pressure-induced superconductivity was observed in phase I for Bi_{2}Te_{3}[46]. Namely, the observation of superconductivity in phase I may not be unusual for mixed compounds of Se and Te such as Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. In other words, the behavior of superconductivity against pressure well reflects the feature of Bi_{2}Te_{3}. This could explain that the above difference is a reasonable phenomenon, although this may not be a complete explanation.

In this study, we did not apply more pressure to the samples because of experimental problems; the pressure could not be increased to a pressure above 15 GPa because of the small culet size of diamond used in this study. To solve this problem, it is necessary to make a small hole in the gasket, and this is now in progress. As a result, the behavior of T_{\rm c} at phase III could not be characterized in the present study, and it is a future task.

Magnetic-field dependence of R-T plot of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} under pressure

The R/R(10 K)-T plots of Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.89(7)}Se_{1.11(7)  which corresponds to the _s_-wave dirty-limit superconductivity, _s_-wave clean-limit model, and _p_-wave polar model. The WHH theory predicts h^{*}(0)=0.69 at t = 0, but the experimental h^{*}(0) does not converge to the value, which is the same as that of Sr0.065Bi2Se3[23] and Ag0.05Bi1.95Se3[24]. The h^{*}(0) value should become 0.80-0.85 for the _p_-wave polar model [23,33,48,50]. The experimental h^{*}(t)-t plot seems to be well followed by the _p_-wave model [see Fig. 7(b)], rather than the theoretical curve of _s_-wave clean/dirty limit. However, the data points are insufficient to conclude the topological superconductivity. Therefore, we have not concluded the _p_-wave pairing for the superconductivity for Bi1.75(4)Sb0.25(4)Te1.89(7)Se1.11(7) at 7.69 GPa, but it must be fully pursued in the future work. In addition, the experimental results that the superconducting transition is broadened and R does not go to zero [Figs. 7(a) and 7(c)] with increasing H under pressure may be due to the chemical and electronic inhomogeneity, fluctuation, and vortex effects, in addition to finite resistance at grain boundaries.

The _R_/R(10 K)-_T_ plot of Bi1.75(4)Sb0.25(4)Te1.89(7)Se1.11(7) at 10.3 GPa is shown in Fig. 7(c), and the R drop is suppressed with an increase in H up to 5.0 T. This pressure corresponds to phase II. The h^{*}-t plot is shown in Fig. 7(d); the error bar is also within the symbol (red circle). The plot is also fitted by the _p_-wave polar model, indicating a possible topological superconductivity. In summary, the possibility that pressure-induced superconducting phase of Bi1.75(4)Sb0.25(4)Te1.89(7)Se1.11(7) is an unconventional superconductor (or topological superconductor) must be fully investigated as a future task. In addition, the pressure-induced superconducting phase seems to have the same nature between phase I and phase II, showing that the superconductivity may not be correlated with structural transition. Furthermore, in Supplemental Material [25], the topological nature in superconductivity is briefly discussed based on the h^{*}-t plots of other Bi2-AsSbTe3-AsPe3 samples under pressure, indicating that the possibility of _p_-wave pairing must be pursued in the pressure-induced superconducting phases.

Moreover, the exploratory density-functional theory calculations for Bi2-AsSb.7Te3-AsPe3 (_x_ = 0 and y = 1.0), Bi2Te2Se, were performed to investigate topological nature in each phase under pressure. The detailed information is described in Supplemental Material [25] (see also Refs. [51,52] therein). From the Z2 invariants for phase I, phase II, and phase III, the topological superconductivity (_p_-wave pairing) suggested from h^{*}-t plots may be reasonable for phase I. This result must also be ascertained in detail.

In addition, we evaluated the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length (_k_GL) using expression, H_{c2}^{\prime}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{h^{*}}}{2\pi\delta_{\text{GL}}^{2}}, from the upper critical magnetic field, H_{c2}^{\prime}(0)  (=0.80[\frac{\partial H_{\rm c}}{\partial T}]_{T=T_{\rm c}}), determined based on p-wave polar model to be 132 A for 7.96 GPa and 87 A for 10.3 GPa in Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.89(7)}Se_{1.11(7)}; \Phi_{0} is 2.0678\times 10^{-7} G cm^{2}. Thus, the \xi_{\rm GL} value somewhat decreased with increasing pressure, indicating the existence of chemical inhomogeneity and granular effect at high pressure.

## IV Conclusion and remarks

In this study, the pressure dependence of crystal structure and physical properties are fully investigated, and three or four phases were found in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. No superconductivity for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples with nominal x of 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0, as well as nominal y=1.0, was observed at ambient pressure. Superconductivity appeared in phase I by applying pressure to these samples. The T_{\rm c} gradually increased with an increase in pressure, and it continuously varied from phase I to phase II. No other superconducting phases appeared. The h^{*}-t plots recorded in both phases of I and II for Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.89(7)}Se_{1.11(7)} and Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)}Se_{1.32(6)}) were well fitted by the p-wave polar model, indicating the topological nature of superconductivity, or at least the necessity of pursuit of topological superconductivity.

The most important point in this study is whether superconductivity changes against the variation of electronic states where the Fermi level decreases and the Dirac point increases with an increase in x. The pressures causing the structural transitions from phase I to phase II, and from phase II to phase III, systematically increased with an increase in x, while the behavior of T_{\rm c} against pressure was almost similar among all samples, i.e., the T_{\rm c} values for all samples continuously increased with an increase in pressure. On the other hand, the insulating behavior in the normal state at low pressure (below 3 GPa) was substantially observed for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} with x\neq 0, while clear metallic behavior was observed for x=0. This result may be reasonably understood when considering the energy difference between the Fermi level and the bulk conduction/valence bands. Through this study, we achieved a systematic study of pressure-driven superconductivity in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. In particular, the findings of the appearance of superconductivity from phase I, the continuous increase in T_{\rm c} against structural change of phase I to phase II, and the suggested topological nature in superconductivity would be a first step not only for the discovery of the pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase in topological materials but also for pioneering topological superconductor.

 at x=0-0.15, and superconducting Cu_{x}Bi_{2}Se_{3} is produced at x=0.1-0.15[21].

The finding of superconductivity in metal-doped Bi_{2}Se_{3} is exciting from two scientific points of view. First is that the behavior of T_{\rm c} against pressure means the discovery of pressure-driven T_{\rm c} enhancement, which suggests a different type of superconducting pairing from that predicted by BCS theory. The second point, which may be more significant, is that the superconductivity may be categorized as "topological superconductivity" characterized by odd parity pairing such as p-wave pairing. The temperature dependence of the reduced upper critical field, h^{*}, fits well with the p-wave polar model, suggesting that Sr_{0.062}Bi_{2}Se_{3} could be a topological superconductor. Our group also reported pressure-driven superconductivity in Ag-doped Bi_{2}Se_{3}, where Ag atom is substituted for Bi, i.e., Ag_{x}Bi_{2-x}Se_{3}[24]; recent work using both photoelectron and x-ray fluorescence holography suggested the intercalation of Ag in the space between Se layers, as well as substitution. No superconductivity was confirmed in Ag_{0.05}Bi_{1.95}Se_{3}, which is the nominal stoichiometry, at ambient pressure, and superconductivity suddenly appeared at 11 GPa. Two superconducting phases appeared in phase II (space group No. 12, _C2/m_) and phase III (space group No. 139, _I4/mmm_), which transform successively from phase I (space group No. 166, _R3m_) with applied pressure. Topological superconductivity was also suggested for Ag_{0.05}Bi_{1.95}Se_{3} from the temperature dependence of h^{*}.

Based on the above scientific background, we pursued pressure-driven superconductivity in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} in which the electronic states can be precisely tuned through x and y[15]. Firstly, the crystal structures of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0,\,0.25,\,0.5,\,1.0, and y=1.0) in a wide pressure range of 0-30 GPa were clarified using powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) with synchrotron radiation. Secondly, the temperature dependence of resistance (R) in the above samples was investigated at 0-15 GPa. Consequently, the successful observation of superconductivity under pressure was achieved for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0,\,0.25,\,0.5,\,1.0, and y=1.0) samples. The T_{\rm c}-pressure (p) phase diagram was drawn for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. Thirdly, the topological nature of pressure-driven superconductivity was investigated from temperature dependence of h^{*} at high pressure. Finally, the correlation between electronic states and superconductivity was discussed.

## II Experimental

### Sample preparation and characterization at ambient pressure

Crystals of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0,\,0.25,\,0.5,\,1.0, and y=1.0) were grown by a conventional melt-growth method using stoichiometric amounts of Bi, Sb, Te, and Se powders, using the following process: the powders were sealed in a quartz tube which was heated at 850 ^{\circ}C for 24 h, then slowly cooled down to 550 ^{\circ}C at a rate of 6 ^{\circ}C/h, and then quenched with ice water. The obtained crystals showed a clear basal plane structure. More details are shown in Supplemental Material, and the XRD patterns of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=1.0,\,y=1.0) are shown in Fig. S1 to show the high sample quality [25].

The energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectra of the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples were recorded with an EDX spectrometer equipped with a scanning electron microscope (KEYENCE VE-9800-EDAX Genesis XM2). The EDX spectra were measured for 5-10 different positions of the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} crystals at room temperature. From the EDX spectra, the chemical compositions of all samples were determined (results are given in Table 1).

The crystal structure at ambient pressure was determined by single-crystal XRD measurement of all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} crystals, which were obtained by cutting off a small piece (\sim100-\mum scale) of the crystals, using a Rigaku Saturn 724 diffractometer equipped with a Mo K\alpha source (wavelength \lambda=0.710\,73\,A); the measurement was performed at 100 K.

### Measurements of XRD and R-T plot under pressure

Powder XRD patterns of the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples were measured under pressure at 297 K, using synchrotron radiation at BL12B2 of SPring-8; the wavelength \lambda of the x-ray beam was 0.6853 A. The powder sample obtained by grinding the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} crystal was used for the powder XRD measurement. A diamond-anvil cell (DAC) was used for the high-pressure XRD measurement, with the powder sample loaded into the hole of a stainless-steel plate. Daphne 7373 was used as the pressure medium for XRD measurement under high pressure. The pressure was determined by monitoring ruby fluorescence.

The DC magnetic susceptibility (M/H) of the small crystal (1-mm scale) of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} was recorded by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS2) at ambient pressure (0 GPa). M and H refer to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. In this SQUID magnetometer, the M/H measurement can be made down to 2.0 K. The temperature dependence of R of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} was measured in four-terminal measurement mode under pressure. The small Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} flake was introduced into the DAC in air because this sample is not air sensitive. The sample was loaded directly on a Kapton sheet/epoxy resin/rhenium in the DAC; six Cu electrodes were attached to the Kapton sheet, and this cell was used for measuring the R of the sample. NaCl was used as the pressure medium. The applied pressure was determined by monitoring ruby fluorescence.

The R was measured at 300-1.5 K in standard four-terminal measurement mode using an Oxford superconducting magnet system. The temperature was precisely controlled using an Oxford Instruments MercuryiTC; the minimum temperature is 1.5 K in this equipment. The H was controlled using Oxford Instruments MercuryiPS. Electric current (I) was supplied by a Keithley 220 programmable current source, and the exact value of I was monitored by an Advantest R-8240 digital electrometer. The voltage (V) was measured by an Agilent 34420 digital nanovoltmeter.

## III Results and Discussion

### Physical properties of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} at ambient pressure

Optical images of the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0,\,0.25,\,0.5,1.0; y=1.0) crystals are shown in Fig. 1(a). Bright basal  planes were observed in all crystals. Only peaks ascribable to Bi, Sb, Te, and Se atoms were observed in the EDX spectra, as seen from Fig. 1(b), indicating no contamination by impurities. The averaged stoichiometry determined from the EDX spectrum is listed in Table 1. The determined x values are almost consistent with the nominal values in all samples, and the determined y value deviates from the nominal value (_y_ = 1.0). The single crystals are homogeneous in stoichiometry, because the estimated standard deviations (esd's) in x and y are small. The lowering of the Fermi level and the raising of the Dirac point against x were confirmed from the ARPES (not shown), in the same manner as those previously reported [15]. As an example, the ARPES of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (_x_ = 0.25) is shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplemental Material [25]; this sample's chemical composition is "Bi1.75(4)Sb0.25(4)Te1.89(7)Se1.11(7)" as later described.

The crystal structure determined by single-crystal diffraction at ambient pressure was rhombohedral (space group No. 166: R3_m_) for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}, which is consistent with that of Bi_{2}Se_{3}[26] and with that previously determined for Bi_{2}Te_{2}Se [27,28]. The lattice constants, a and c, determined are listed in Table 1, and the atomic coordinates are listed in Table 1 in Supplemental Material [25]. The lattice constants are close to those of Bi_{2}Se_{3} (4.18 and 28.7 A) [26]. The values of a and c increase slowly with increasing x, but maximum c value is recorded at x = 0.5. Here it is noticed that the y value [= 1.32(6)] at x = 0.5 determined from EDX is larger than those (\sim1.2) at x = 0, 0.25, and 1.0. From this result, it may be concluded that the increase in y causes the expansion of the unit cell. The stoichiometry for each Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} sample determined from single-crystal XRD is listed in Table 1. The stoichiometry determined from single-crystal XRD is almost consistent with that from EDX. Thus, the stoichiometry determined from EDX is reliable. Throughout this paper, the stoichiometry determined from EDX is employed for each Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} sample. Crystallographic data of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples are listed in Table S1 of Supplemental Material [25].

Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show temperature dependence of R and magnetic susceptibility (_M/H_) for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te1.81(2)Se1.2(2) prepared as Bi_{2}Te_{2}Se (i.e., nominal x of 0; nominal y of 1.0 for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}, respectively, measured at 2.73 GPa and ambient pressure (0 GPa), where M and H refer to magnetization and applied magnetic field, respectively. No superconductivity is observed near ambient pressure, as seen from Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). The _R_-_T_ plot [Fig. 1(c)] at 2.73 GPa substantially shows metallic behavior. Strictly speaking, the R saturates at higher temperature than 200 K. This behavior may be due to the fact that the Fermi level does not match the bulk conduction band, but crosses the bottom of the conduction band or the top of surface states [15]. The _M/H_-_T_ plots for other Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples (i.e., nominal x = 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0; nominal y = 1.0) did not show any superconducting transition at low pressure (not shown). Thus, all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples are not superconductors at ambient pressure.

### Pressure dependence of crystal structure of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}

Figures 2(a)-2(d) show XRD patterns of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples under pressure up to 29 GPa. As seen from Fig. 2(a), the XRD patterns of Bi_{2.1(1)}Te1.8(2)Se1.2(2) at 2.4-29 GPa show the presence of three different phases (phase I, phase II, and phase III) which were assigned to rhombohedral (space group No. 166, R3_m_), monoclinic (space group No. 12, C2/_m_), and 9/10-fold monoclinic (space group No. 12, C2/_m_), respectively. These crystal structures are shown in

Figure 1: (a) Optical image and (b) EDX spectrum of a crystal-like lump of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (_x_ = 0.25 and y = 1.0). (c) _R_–_T_ plot and (d) _M/H_–_T_ plot of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (nominal x = 0 and y = 1.0) recorded at 2.73 and 0 GPa, respectively.

  Fig. 3. The crystal structures of phase I and phase II are the same as those previously determined [27,28]. However, the crystal structure of phase III is different from those reported in Refs. [27] and [28], and was the same as that for Bi_{2}Te_{3} and Bi_{2}Se_{3} reported in Refs. [29] and [30]. In this study, we performed Le Bail fitting for the XRD pattern based on various space groups suggested for Bi_{2}Te_{3}[29,31,32], Bi_{2}Se_{3}[30,33,34,35,36,37], Sb_{5}Se_{3}[38,39], and Sb_{2}Te_{3}[40,41,42,43], and Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}[27,28,44,45], and the experimental XRD pattern of Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)} for each phase was most exactly fitted by the above space group: rhombohedral structure (space group No. 166, R\bar{3}m) for phase I, monoclinic structure (space group No. 12, C2/m) for phase II, and 9/10-fold monoclinic structure (space group No. 12, C2/m) for phase III).

For showing the quality of fit between experimental and calculated XRD pattern in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}, the experimental XRD patterns of Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)} at 2.37, 14.4, and 28.6 GPa are shown in Fig. S3 [25], with the patterns calculated by Le Bail fitting. All XRD peaks are well fitted, as seen from Fig. S3 [25]. The values of weighted pattern R factor (wR_{\rm p}), pattern R factor (R_{\rm p}), and \chi^{2} in the Le Bail fitting were 2.98%, 1.48%, and 0.921 for 2.37 GPa; 2.13%, 1.15%, and 0.743 for 14.4 GPa; and 1.60%, 0.96%, and 0.449 for 28.6 GPa. The values of wR_{\rm p} and R_{\rm p} in the Le Bail fitting for pressure-dependent XRD patterns were less than 3% for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, less than 4% for Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.8(9)}Te_{1.1(7)}, less than 7.0% for Bi_{1.5(3)}Sb_{0.5(3)}Te_{1.6(8)}Se_{1.3(26)}, and less than 4.5% for Bi_{1.08(9)}Sb_{0.91(18)}Te_{1.8(1)}Se_{1.1(9)}, indicating the good fit between the experimental and calculated XRD patterns.

In this study, we partly performed Rietveld refinement for XRD patterns at 2.37 GPa (phase I), 14.4 GPa (phase II), and 28.6 GPa (phase III) for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, less than 4% for Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.8(9)}Te_{1.1(7)}, less than 7.0% for Bi_{1.5(3)}Sb_{0.5(3)}Te_{1.6(8)}Se_{1.3(26)}, and less than 4.5% for Bi_{1.08(9)}Sb_{0.91(18)}Te_{1.8(1)}Se_{1.1(9)}, indicating the solidity of the space group suggested for each phase; the values of wR_{\rm p}, R_{\rm p}, and \chi^{2} in the Rietveld analyses were 3.21%, 1.83%, and 1.06, for 2.37 GPa; 2.40%, 1.81%, and 0.938 for 14.4 GPa; and 1.36%, 1.00%, and 0.320 for 28.6 GPa. The lattice constants determined by Rietveld refinement are the same as those determined by L De Bail fitting. The lattice constants and atomic coordinates determined in the Rietveld analyses are listed in Table S2 [25].

The first and second structural phase transitions are observed at 8.36 and 15.4 GPa, respectively, for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}. Actually, it is noticed that multiple phases exist around the above pressures. Namely, phase I still remains even above 8.36 GPa, although phase II emerges at 8.36 GPa. Only phase II is found from 13.3 GPa. Such a coexistence of multiple phases (phase II and phase III) is observed at 15.4-18.9 GPa, and a single phase (phase III) exists from 22.5 GPa. As a consequence, the structural transition is not sharp but broad, i.e., pressure width of a few GPa is observed for the complete structural transition. For a simple understanding of the evolution of structure against pressure, a schematic representation is given in Fig. 4(a). In addition, our results on crystal structures for phase I and phase II are consistent with those reported previously for Bi_{2}Te_{2}Se [27,28,45], and the crystal structure for phase III is different from those (space group No.229, Im3m[27], space group No.139, I4/mmm[28,45]) reported previously. However, our suggested structure (space group No. 12, C2/m) provided the better fit between the experimental and calculated XRD patterns both in Le Bail fitting and Rietveld refinement.

Figure 3: Crystal structures of phase I, phase II, phase II’, and phase III in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}.

Figure 2: Pressure-dependent powder XRD patterns of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}, with nominal x values of (a) 0, (b) 0.25, (c) 0.5, and (d) 1.0; nominal y value is 1.0 for all samples. Measurement temperature and pressure are 297 K and 0–30 GPa, respectively.

  In addition, the monoclinic structure (space group No. 12, _C2/m_) corresponds to the distorted structure of the above body-centered cubic structure (space group No.229, _Im3m_), or body-centered tetragonal structure (space group No.139, _IA/mmm_).

As seen from the XRD patterns shown in Figs. 2(b)-2(d), Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.80(7)}Se_{1.11(7)}, Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)} Se_{1.32(6)}, and Bi_{1.08(9)}Sb_{0.91(8)}Te_{1.81(3)}Se_{1.19(3)} have four different phases (phase I, phase II, phase II', and phase III) for each sample under pressure up to 30 GPa; the nominal x and y values for the above samples are listed in Table 1. Here, it should be noticed that phase II' is additionally observed although only three phases are found in Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.80(2)}Se_{1.2(2)} [Fig. 2(a)]. The crystal structures of main phases, phase I, phase II, and phase III, are the same as those in Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}. The crystal structure of phase II' was assigned to monoclinic structure (space group No. 15, _C2/c_). The atomic coordinates and lattice constants in the monoclinic structures of phase II, phase II', and phase III are different from each other [28], and as described later, the discontinuous change of lattice constants and volume is observed between monoclinic phases. The pressures for transitions of phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III were 9.06 and 15.9 GPa for Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.80(7)}Se_{1.11(7)}, respectively. The pressures were 10.0 and 18.7 GPa for Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)}Se_{1.32(6)}, and 11.2 and 22.3 GPa for Bi_{1.089(3)}Sb_{0.91(18)}Te_{1.81(3)}Se_{1.19(3)}; the crystal phases determined for phase I and phase II are the same as those reported previously for Bi_{1.5}Sb_{0.5}Te_{1.8}Se_{1.2} [Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0.5)] [45], indicating the reliability of our crystal data. However, our suggested crystal structure for phase III (space group No. 12, _C2/m_) is different from that reported previously (space group No.139, _IA/mmm_[45]). Our suggested crystal structure provided the better fit between experimental and calculated XRD patterns as in Bi_{2}Te_{2}Se. No crystal data under pressure have been reported for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (x=0.25 and 1.0).

In the same manner as Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.82(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, multiple phases exist around the above pressures, as seen from Figs. 2(b)-2(d) and Fig. 4(a). Figure 4(b) shows the pressures causing structural phase transitions (phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III) for each sample. Both pressures for phase I to phase II and phase II to phase III monotonically increase with an increase in x, i.e., amount of Sb. Actually, as seen from Figs. 2(b)-2(d), phases II' emerges together with phase II and/or phase III in the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{x}, samples other than Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, and still exists even in phase III; the schematic representation of phases against pressure is shown in Fig. 4(a).

The lattice constants (a and c) against pressure for the Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples are shown in Figs. S5(a)-S5(d) [25]. The discontinuous change of lattice constants is observed with each structural transition, indicating the first-order transition. The _V/Z_ value monotonously decreases with an increase in pressure (Fig. 5), and discontinuous changes (sudden drop) are observed at the pressures corresponding to structural transitions [Figs. 5(a)-5(d)]; the Z is the number of asymmetry units in each crystal lattice, and _V/Z_ corresponds to the volume per a Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. As seen from Figs. 5(a)-5(d), two or three phases coexist at a part of the region in phase II and phase III. Moreover, the ratios of lattice constants at each pressure with respect to that at minimum pressure in each phase (phase I, phase II, and phase III) of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{2}Se (x=0.25) are illustrated in Figs. S6-S8, indicating an extremely small anisotropy for contraction against pressure in all phases. Admittedly, the _c/c_(0.41 GPa) is slightly smaller than _a/a_(0.41 GPa) in phase I, but the difference is within 2% 10 GPa the peak broadening may take place. Nevertheless, the lattice constants and V were definitely determined with very small ed's up to 30 GPa, indicating the structural parameters obtained are reliable.

### Pressure dependence of physical properties of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}

Figure 6(a) shows the temperature dependence of R in Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.82(2)}Se_{1.1(2)} at different pressures, where

Figure 4: (a) Schematic representation of evolution of crystal structure against pressure, and (b) x dependence of pressure causing structural transitions (phase I to phase II, and phase II to phase III) in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}.

  R/R(10 K) is plotted, i.e., the R is normalized at 10 K so that all data obtained in the different measurements can be reasonably compared. The R/R(10 K)-T plots at 0-2 GPa show no superconductivity down to 1.5 K in increasing pressure, while a clear superconducting transition appears above 2.5 GPa which is in phase I. Figure 6(b) shows the T_{\text{c}}-p plot in Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.8(2)}Se_{1.2(2)}, in which the T_{\text{c}} values are determined from the R/R(10 K)-T plots at different pressures shown in Fig. 6(a). As seen from Fig. 6(b), the T_{\text{c}} monotonically increases with an increase in pressure. No significant variation in T_{\text{c}}-p plot is observed at the structural transition of phase I to phase II. Here, we comment that a complete disappearance of R drop for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples is clearly confirmed under H as high as several tesla. These results indicate that the R drop originates from the superconducting transition. Examples of H dependence of R/R(10 K)-T plots under pressure are shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(c), as described later. We must briefly comment on nonvanishing R at the superconducting state in the R/R(10 K)-T plots (Figs. 6 and 7). As seen from Figs. 6(a), 7(a), and 7(c), the complete zero resistance (zero-R) even in the superconducting state is not observed because of polycrystallinity of the sample employed in resistance measurement under pressure, i.e., the resistance at grain boundaries between single crystals provides nonvanishing R in the superconducting state.

Figure 6(b) shows the T_{\text{c}}-p plots in the other Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples (Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.89(7)}Se_{1.11(7)}, Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)}Se_{1.32(6)}, and Bi_{1.089(8)}Sb_{0.91(8)}Te_{1.81(3)}Se_{1.19(3)}). The T_{\text{c}} value was determined from the cross point between R drop and R-T plot in the normal state, as seen from Fig. S9(a) in Supplemental Material [25]. All samples show no superconductivity at low pressures below 3 GPa, and the superconductivity emerged in phase I. The T_{\text{c}} increases with an increase in pressure, and any discontinuous variation is not observed at structural phase transition (phase I to phase II), as seen from Fig. 6(b). Actually, the T_{\text{c}} for Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)}Se_{1.32(6)} rapidly and continuously increases at 10 GPa, at which the phase II appears. When decreasing pressure, the superconductivity of the above samples could be kept down to lower pressure than the pressure at which the superconductivity emerges in increasing pressure (or onset pressure), indicating the presence of hysteresis in the T_{\text{c}}-p plot. The behavior of T_{\text{c}} against pressure is similar in all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples, inclusive of Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.82(2)}Se_{1.1(2)}. The pressure at which the superconductivity emerges and the maximum T_{\text{c}} for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples are listed in Table 2; the maximum T_{\text{c}} of 5.45 K is recorded at 13.5 GPa for Bi_{2.1(1)}Te_{1.82(2)}Se_{1.1(2)} in the pressure range of 0-15 GPa. The T_{\text{c}} values for all samples still increase in the pressure range achieved in this study, and each T_{\text{c}} continuously varies at phase I and phase II, indicating that the density of states (DOS) on the Fermi level may increase with a shrinkage of lattice volume, although the behavior cannot simply be explained. To clarify the mechanism of the increase in T_{\text{c}} against pressure more, a theoretical evaluation of electronic

Figure 5: Pressure dependence of V of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} (_V/Z_) with nominal x values of (a) 0, (b) 0.25, (c) 0.5, and (d) 1.0; nominal y value is 1.0 for all samples. Chemical composition for each sample is listed in Table 1. Z is the number of asymmetry unit.

  states of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} under pressure was performed for three selected structures, indicating the enhancement of DOS with increasing pressure (Figs. S10-S12 [25]). Namely, the increase in T_{\rm c} against pressure may be due to the DOS enhancement. In addition, the Hall-effect measurement under pressure may be efficient to experimentally confirm the change of carrier density and DOS, which may be a future task.

Here, we must consider why superconductivity for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} emerged in phase I, different from Bi_{2}Se_{3} and Ag-doped Bi_{2}Se_{3} in which superconductivity appeared in phase II [24,37]. This result seems to be quite strange. However, it should be noticed that pressure-induced superconductivity was observed in phase I for Bi_{2}Te_{3}[46]. Namely, the observation of superconductivity in phase I may not be unusual for mixed compounds of Se and Te such as Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. In other words, the behavior of superconductivity against pressure well reflects the feature of Bi_{2}Te_{3}. This could explain that the above difference is a reasonable phenomenon, although this may not be a complete explanation.

In this study, we did not apply more pressure to the samples because of experimental problems; the pressure could not be increased to a pressure above 15 GPa because of the small culet size of diamond used in this study. To solve this problem, it is necessary to make a small hole in the gasket, and this is now in progress. As a result, the behavior of T_{\rm c} at phase III could not be characterized in the present study, and it is a future task.

Magnetic-field dependence of R-T plot of Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} under pressure

The R/R(10 K)-T plots of Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.89(7)}Se_{1.11(7)  which corresponds to the _s_-wave dirty-limit superconductivity, _s_-wave clean-limit model, and _p_-wave polar model. The WHH theory predicts h^{*}(0)=0.69 at t = 0, but the experimental h^{*}(0) does not converge to the value, which is the same as that of Sr0.065Bi2Se3[23] and Ag0.05Bi1.95Se3[24]. The h^{*}(0) value should become 0.80-0.85 for the _p_-wave polar model [23,33,48,50]. The experimental h^{*}(t)-t plot seems to be well followed by the _p_-wave model [see Fig. 7(b)], rather than the theoretical curve of _s_-wave clean/dirty limit. However, the data points are insufficient to conclude the topological superconductivity. Therefore, we have not concluded the _p_-wave pairing for the superconductivity for Bi1.75(4)Sb0.25(4)Te1.89(7)Se1.11(7) at 7.69 GPa, but it must be fully pursued in the future work. In addition, the experimental results that the superconducting transition is broadened and R does not go to zero [Figs. 7(a) and 7(c)] with increasing H under pressure may be due to the chemical and electronic inhomogeneity, fluctuation, and vortex effects, in addition to finite resistance at grain boundaries.

The _R_/R(10 K)-_T_ plot of Bi1.75(4)Sb0.25(4)Te1.89(7)Se1.11(7) at 10.3 GPa is shown in Fig. 7(c), and the R drop is suppressed with an increase in H up to 5.0 T. This pressure corresponds to phase II. The h^{*}-t plot is shown in Fig. 7(d); the error bar is also within the symbol (red circle). The plot is also fitted by the _p_-wave polar model, indicating a possible topological superconductivity. In summary, the possibility that pressure-induced superconducting phase of Bi1.75(4)Sb0.25(4)Te1.89(7)Se1.11(7) is an unconventional superconductor (or topological superconductor) must be fully investigated as a future task. In addition, the pressure-induced superconducting phase seems to have the same nature between phase I and phase II, showing that the superconductivity may not be correlated with structural transition. Furthermore, in Supplemental Material [25], the topological nature in superconductivity is briefly discussed based on the h^{*}-t plots of other Bi2-AsSbTe3-AsPe3 samples under pressure, indicating that the possibility of _p_-wave pairing must be pursued in the pressure-induced superconducting phases.

Moreover, the exploratory density-functional theory calculations for Bi2-AsSb.7Te3-AsPe3 (_x_ = 0 and y = 1.0), Bi2Te2Se, were performed to investigate topological nature in each phase under pressure. The detailed information is described in Supplemental Material [25] (see also Refs. [51,52] therein). From the Z2 invariants for phase I, phase II, and phase III, the topological superconductivity (_p_-wave pairing) suggested from h^{*}-t plots may be reasonable for phase I. This result must also be ascertained in detail.

In addition, we evaluated the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length (_k_GL) using expression, H_{c2}^{\prime}(0)=\frac{\Phi_{h^{*}}}{2\pi\delta_{\text{GL}}^{2}}, from the upper critical magnetic field, H_{c2}^{\prime}(0)  (=0.80[\frac{\partial H_{\rm c}}{\partial T}]_{T=T_{\rm c}}), determined based on p-wave polar model to be 132 A for 7.96 GPa and 87 A for 10.3 GPa in Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.89(7)}Se_{1.11(7)}; \Phi_{0} is 2.0678\times 10^{-7} G cm^{2}. Thus, the \xi_{\rm GL} value somewhat decreased with increasing pressure, indicating the existence of chemical inhomogeneity and granular effect at high pressure.

## IV Conclusion and remarks

In this study, the pressure dependence of crystal structure and physical properties are fully investigated, and three or four phases were found in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. No superconductivity for all Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} samples with nominal x of 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0, as well as nominal y=1.0, was observed at ambient pressure. Superconductivity appeared in phase I by applying pressure to these samples. The T_{\rm c} gradually increased with an increase in pressure, and it continuously varied from phase I to phase II. No other superconducting phases appeared. The h^{*}-t plots recorded in both phases of I and II for Bi_{1.75(4)}Sb_{0.25(4)}Te_{1.89(7)}Se_{1.11(7)} and Bi_{1.50(3)}Sb_{0.50(3)}Te_{1.68(6)}Se_{1.32(6)}) were well fitted by the p-wave polar model, indicating the topological nature of superconductivity, or at least the necessity of pursuit of topological superconductivity.

The most important point in this study is whether superconductivity changes against the variation of electronic states where the Fermi level decreases and the Dirac point increases with an increase in x. The pressures causing the structural transitions from phase I to phase II, and from phase II to phase III, systematically increased with an increase in x, while the behavior of T_{\rm c} against pressure was almost similar among all samples, i.e., the T_{\rm c} values for all samples continuously increased with an increase in pressure. On the other hand, the insulating behavior in the normal state at low pressure (below 3 GPa) was substantially observed for Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y} with x\neq 0, while clear metallic behavior was observed for x=0. This result may be reasonably understood when considering the energy difference between the Fermi level and the bulk conduction/valence bands. Through this study, we achieved a systematic study of pressure-driven superconductivity in Bi_{2-x}Sb_{x}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}. In particular, the findings of the appearance of superconductivity from phase I, the continuous increase in T_{\rm c} against structural change of phase I to phase II, and the suggested topological nature in superconductivity would be a first step not only for the discovery of the pressure-driven high-T_{\rm c} phase in topological materials but also for pioneering topological superconductor.
