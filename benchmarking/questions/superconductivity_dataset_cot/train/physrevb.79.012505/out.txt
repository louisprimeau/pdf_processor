###### Abstract

We report the observation of superconductivity in La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} at 2.2 K. The layer stacking in this compound results in an asymmetric distribution of charge reservoir layers around the Ni_{2}P_{2} planes. The estimated Wilson ratio, _R_{\rm W}=_ 5, indicates the presence of strongly enhanced normal-state susceptibility, but many of the basic superconducting characteristics are conventional. The estimated electronic contribution to the specific heat, _g\approx_ 6.2 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K^{-2}, is about 2/3 of that found in layered nickel borocarbide superconductors.

Like the high-_T_{c}_ copper oxides,^{1} the oxypnictide superconductors^{2-4} are based on square metal layers. Several structural classes of these superconductors (with _X-M_{2}-X_ layers, where M =Fe or Ni, and X =P, As, or Se), are currently known. The simplest is based on _b_-FeSe,^{5} which consists of Se-Fe_{2}-Se layers only, and can be considered as the parent compound of the family. A related compound, Li_{x}FeAs, also superconducts.^{6,7} Others, typified by BaNi_{2}P_{2} (Ref. [8]) and K-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2},^{9} are derived from the _b_-FeSe-like parent by inserting layers of alkali earth ions between _X-M_{2}-X_ layers. Superconducting LaFeAsO and LaNiPO (Refs. [2] and [3]) are derived instead by inserting whole La-O_{2}-La layers between the _X-M_{2}-X_ layers. Here we show that La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, a compound that has a mixed-layer structure between LaNi_{2}P_{2} and LaNiPO, is superconducting with a _T_{c}_ of 2.2 K. The stacking of inequivalent charge reservoir layers in LaNi_{4}P_{4}O_{2} leads to an asymmetric distribution of ionic layers around the Ni_{2}P_{2} planes, a structure-derived electronic feature that is not observed in any other known member of the superconducting oxypnictides.

Polycrystalline La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} samples were prepared from Ni_{3}P_{4}, elemental P, and dry La_{2}O_{3}.^{10} Physical property characterization was performed on a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS). Neutron-diffraction data were collected at the NIST Center for Neutron Research on the BT-1 powder neutron diffractometer.^{11} The crystal structure was determined by a Rietveld fit^{12,13} to powder neutron-diffraction data. The diffracted peak positions and intensities were well fit by a tetragonal Pr_{3}Cu_{4}P_{4}O_{2}-type crystal structure.^{14} The fractional occupancies of each crystallographic site were independently refined and, within two standard deviations, were all found to be equal to one. Therefore the structure can be considered stoichiometric, and for the final refinement, all site occupancies were fixed at unity. The refined structural parameters are summarized in Table 1. Small quantities of two impurity phases are present in the best preparations; 10.0(2)% of LaNiPO and 6.1(2)% LaNi_{3}P_{3} were included in the final fit for the sample characterized in this study.

The crystal structure of La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} is made from covalently bonded P-Ni_{2}-P layers, the common structural motif seen throughout the superconducting oxypnictide family. The _M-X_ bond lengths and _M-X-M_ bond angles within these covalent layers are under discussion as important chemical influences on the electronic properties in this family of compounds (see, e.g., Ref. [15]), as is _X-X_ bonding.^{16} These layers are separated in the new compound by an alternating pattern of layers of La and La-O_{2}-La. Figure 1 shows the crystal structure, which is an ordered structural mixture of LaNiPO (Ref. [3]) and LaNi_{2}P_{2},^{17} and its relationship to those phases and the parent _b_-FeSe structure type. These compounds form a homologous series with the formula (La_{2}O_{2})_{m}[La_{2}Ba_{\parallel}[Ni_{2}P_{2})_{n+m}, and, including La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, the _m,n_ pairs (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1) are known to support superconductivity. In Fig. 1, the La^{3+} and O^{-2} ions are drawn using ionic radii and the M and X atoms are drawn using covalent radii. This rendering reflects a chemically interesting aspect of the oxypnictide superconductors--the intimate intergrowth of highly ionic layers such as La^{3+} and (La_{2}O_{2})^{2+} with highly covalent _X-M_{2}-X_ layers such as Ni_{2}P_{2} or Fe_{2}As_{2}. These ionic layers are the "charge reservoirs;" completely analogous to those in the layered high-_T_{c}_ copper

  oxides. What is unique about La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} among the oxypnictide superconductors is that the distribution of charge reservoir layers around the Ni_{2}P_{2} plane is highly asymmetric; i.e., the sequence of layers is [La^{3+}]-[P-Ni_{2}-P]-[La-O_{2}-La]^{2+}. Thus, the Ni_{2}P_{2} layer is sandwiched between two different ionic layers--an arrangement that should lead to the presence of a local electric-dipole field across the superconducting plane.

Figure 2 shows the superconducting transition for La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} characterized by magnetic susceptibility (H_{\rm DC} =10 Oe). The critical temperature (T_{c}) is about 2.2 K. The minor diamagnetism visible in the temperature range 2.5 K to 4 K is associated with the presence of the 10% LaNiPO impurity phase. As is the usual case, pinning of vortices produces a smaller field-cooled (FC) signal compared to zero-field cooling (ZFC). The diamagnetic response in ZFC measurements is substantially larger than 1/4\pi, which we attribute to demagnetization effects of the rectangular-shaped sample. To estimate the demagnetization factor (d), measurements of the low-field magnetization were made at 1.9 K, shown in Fig. 3. Assuming that the initial linear response to fields less than 50 Oe is perfectly diamagnetic, that is, that the slope dM/dH is -1/4\,\pi, we obtain a demagnetization factor that is consistent with the sample's shape. Applying this demagnetization factor gives the maximum ZFC susceptibility in Fig. 2 of approximately -1.1(1/4\,\pi). As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, M(1.9\, K) begins to deviate from a fitted linear dependence on H at a field H^{*} = 60 Oe, giving a lower critical field,[18] taking into account the demagnetization factor, of H_{\rm C1}(1.9\, K)=H^{*}/(1\cdot d) = 90 \pm 10 Oe. The estimated uncertainty reflects criteria that H^{*} is either the field above which M first deviates from the fitted line or the field where M deviates by 2.5% above the fitted curve. On the basis of this H_{\rm C1} at 1.9 K and T_{c} in zero field, a crude estimate of the zero-temperature lower critical field is about 520 Oe, which would imply a Ginzburg-Landau superconducting penetration depth of approximately \lambda_{\rm GL} of 550\pm 50 A.[18]

The inset of Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the estimated normal-state magnetic susceptibility. Low-field (H=1 kOe) measurements indicated the presence of small amounts of ferromagnetic impurity with a low coercive field, likely elemental nickel, in the best samples. This makes the usual low-field measurement of susceptibility invalid due to the relatively high contribution of the ferromagnetic impurity to the measured magnetization at low fields. Therefore, to approximate the intrinsic susceptibility of La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, the difference in magnetization \Delta M between applied fields of 50 and 40 kOe, well above the coercive field of the ferromagnetic impurity, was employed to estimate the susceptibility \chi=\Delta M/\Delta H. Above 250 K La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} exhibits temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism with \chi_{0} = 1.8 \times 10^{-4} emu mol^{-1}. Below 250 K, \chi(T) increases with decreasing temperature and reaches maximum at about 14 K. This may reflect the existence of a magnetic transition in this phase, but the presence of LaNiPO and LaNi_{3}P_{3} impurities

Figure 2: (Color online) Superconducting transition measured in zero-field-cooled (closed circles) and field-cooled mode (open circles) under applied magnetic field 10 Oe. Inset of the figure represents magnetic susceptibility (\Delta M/\Delta H) in the wide temperature range. \chi=\Delta M/\Delta H was calculated as the difference in magnetization \Delta M between applied fields of 50 and 40 kOe (see text).

Figure 1: (Color online) La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} is a member of a series of compounds built by inserting charged ions or layers between M_{2}X_{2} sheets of the parent \beta-FeSe structure. All the oxypnictide superconductors are members of this family. The La^{3+} and O^{-2} ions are drawn with ionic radii and the M and X atoms are drawn with covalent radii.

  precludes more detailed analysis at this time.

Specific-heat (C_{p}) measurements performed at 0 and 90 kOe magnetic fields are shown in Fig. 4. The data in zero field (closed circles) show an anomaly at T_{c}=2.3 K, close to the T_{c} determined by susceptibility measurement. (There is also a small anomaly near 4 K due to the LaNiPO impurity.) The normal-state specific heat measured at \mu_{0}H=9 T, shown by open circles, was fitted to C_{p}= \gamma T+ \beta T^{3}+ A/T^{5}, where the first, second, and third terms represent electronic, lattice, and nuclear Schottky contributions, respectively. The fit to these data allows us to estimate \gamma =6.2 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K^{-2}, \beta=0.14 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K^{-4}, and A =0.49 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K. The value of \gamma is smaller than those found in the layered nickel borocarbide superconductors, e.g., LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (8.9 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K^{-2}),[19] which also have significantly higher T_{c}s (16.5 K for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C). Given both \gamma and \chi_{0}, the Wilson ratio can be estimated for La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, yielding R_{W}=\frac{(\pi\mu_{0})^{2}\chi_{0}}{\lambda_{\mu_{0}^{2}\Delta\chi_{0}}}\approx 5 [\mu_{\rm eff}=2.76\times 10^{-21} erg/Oe was calculated from the \chi(T) fit of 50-350 K to Curie-Weiss law]. This is significantly higher than the free-electron value (R_{W} =1) and indicates a spin-enhanced susceptibility. The normalized specific-heat jump at T_{c} can also be calculated from \gamma. The experimental value for La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, \Delta C_{\rm el}/ \gamma T_{c}=1.25, is lower than the BCS prediction[20] of 1.43, likely due to the influence of the impurity phases on the measured \gamma. The simple Debye model connects the \beta coefficient and Debye temperature (\Theta_{D}) through \Theta_{D}=(\frac{12\mu^{4}}{S_{B}}nR)^{1/3}\approx 360 K, where R= 8.314 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}, \beta_{n}=4\beta=0.56 mJ mol K^{-4}, and n =13 for La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}. With this value for \Theta_{D}, we can estimate the electron-phonon coupling constant (\lambda_{\rm ep}) from McMillian's relation:[21]\lambda_{\rm ep}=\frac{1.04\mu_{\rm eff}

  the related Ni-based superconductors YNi_{2}B_{2}C (65 A) (Ref. [23]) and MgCNi_{3} (47 A).[24] The present analysis does not reveal any overtly unconventional behavior in La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} beyond the presence of a spin-enhanced susceptibility. While there is widespread belief that there is a relationship between superconductivity and magnetism in the Fe-based oxypnictides, early band-structure calculations on LaNiPO (Ref. [25]) have been interpreted as indicating that the nickel oxypnictides are conventional superconductors. The issue of conventional vs unconventional superconductivity in the Ni-based superconductors--the layered borocarbides and MgCNi_{3}--continues to be an open one, however. Arguments both for and against conventional superconductivity in this family, based on detailed experiments, continue to be presented.[19, 25, 26, 27, 28] Thus, future detailed characterization of the nickel-based oxypnictide superconductors BaNi_{2}P_{2}, La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, and LaNiPO will be of interest. The crystal structure of La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} is unique among the superconducting oxypnictides due to the asymmetric distribution of charge reservoir layers around the Ni_{2}P_{2} plane. For the one copper oxide superconductor in which a similar structural asymmetry is known, Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{3}O_{15}, unexpected behavior has been predicted.[29] Whether this asymmetry may be the reason why the T_{c} in La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} is approximately half that of BaNi_{2}P_{2} and LaNiPO is an issue that will require further study. The growth of single crystals will be required to provide more precise characterization of the normal state and superconducting properties.

Like the high-_T_{c}_ copper oxides,^{1} the oxypnictide superconductors^{2-4} are based on square metal layers. Several structural classes of these superconductors (with _X-M_{2}-X_ layers, where M =Fe or Ni, and X =P, As, or Se), are currently known.

Here we show that La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, a compound that has a mixed-layer structure between LaNi_{2}P_{2} and LaNiPO, is superconducting with a _T_{c}_ of 2.2 K.

  oxides. What is unique about La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} among the oxypnictide superconductors is that the distribution of charge reservoir layers around the Ni_{2}P_{2} plane is highly asymmetric; i.e., the sequence of layers is [La^{3+}]-[P-Ni_{2}-P]-[La-O_{2}-La]^{2+}. Thus, the Ni_{2}P_{2} layer is sandwiched between two different ionic layers--an arrangement that should lead to the presence of a local electric-dipole field across the superconducting plane.

Figure 2 shows the superconducting transition for La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} characterized by magnetic susceptibility (H_{\rm DC} =10 Oe). The critical temperature (T_{c}) is about 2.2 K. The minor diamagnetism visible in the temperature range 2.5 K to 4 K is associated with the presence of the 10% LaNiPO impurity phase. As is the usual case, pinning of vortices produces a smaller field-cooled (FC) signal compared to zero-field cooling (ZFC). The diamagnetic response in ZFC measurements is substantially larger than 1/4\pi, which we attribute to demagnetization effects of the rectangular-shaped sample. To estimate the demagnetization factor (d), measurements of the low-field magnetization were made at 1.9 K, shown in Fig. 3. Assuming that the initial linear response to fields less than 50 Oe is perfectly diamagnetic, that is, that the slope dM/dH is -1/4\,\pi, we obtain a demagnetization factor that is consistent with the sample's shape. Applying this demagnetization factor gives the maximum ZFC susceptibility in Fig. 2 of approximately -1.1(1/4\,\pi). As shown in the inset of Fig. 3, M(1.9\, K) begins to deviate from a fitted linear dependence on H at a field H^{*} = 60 Oe, giving a lower critical field,[18] taking into account the demagnetization factor, of H_{\rm C1}(1.9\, K)=H^{*}/(1\cdot d) = 90 \pm 10 Oe. The estimated uncertainty reflects criteria that H^{*} is either the field above which M first deviates from the fitted line or the field where M deviates by 2.5% above the fitted curve. On the basis of this H_{\rm C1} at 1.9 K and T_{c} in zero field, a crude estimate of the zero-temperature lower critical field is about 520 Oe, which would imply a Ginzburg-Landau superconducting penetration depth of approximately \lambda_{\rm GL} of 550\pm 50 A.[18]

The inset of Fig. 2 shows the temperature dependence of the estimated normal-state magnetic susceptibility. Low-field (H=1 kOe) measurements indicated the presence of small amounts of ferromagnetic impurity with a low coercive field, likely elemental nickel, in the best samples. This makes the usual low-field measurement of susceptibility invalid due to the relatively high contribution of the ferromagnetic impurity to the measured magnetization at low fields. Therefore, to approximate the intrinsic susceptibility of La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, the difference in magnetization \Delta M between applied fields of 50 and 40 kOe, well above the coercive field of the ferromagnetic impurity, was employed to estimate the susceptibility \chi=\Delta M/\Delta H. Above 250 K La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} exhibits temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism with \chi_{0} = 1.8 \times 10^{-4} emu mol^{-1}. Below 250 K, \chi(T) increases with decreasing temperature and reaches maximum at about 14 K. This may reflect the existence of a magnetic transition in this phase, but the presence of LaNiPO and LaNi_{3}P_{3} impurities

Inset of the figure represents magnetic susceptibility (\Delta M/\Delta H) in the wide temperature range. \chi=\Delta M/\Delta H was calculated as the difference in magnetization \Delta M between applied fields of 50 and 40 kOe (see text).

Figure 1: (Color online) La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} is a member of a series of compounds built by inserting charged ions or layers between M_{2}X_{2} sheets of the parent \beta-FeSe structure. All the oxypnictide superconductors are members of this family. The La^{3+} and O^{-2} ions are drawn with ionic radii and the M and X atoms are drawn with covalent radii.

  precludes more detailed analysis at this time.

Specific-heat (C_{p}) measurements performed at 0 and 90 kOe magnetic fields are shown in Fig. 4. The data in zero field (closed circles) show an anomaly at T_{c}=2.3 K, close to the T_{c} determined by susceptibility measurement. (There is also a small anomaly near 4 K due to the LaNiPO impurity.) The normal-state specific heat measured at \mu_{0}H=9 T, shown by open circles, was fitted to C_{p}= \gamma T+ \beta T^{3}+ A/T^{5}, where the first, second, and third terms represent electronic, lattice, and nuclear Schottky contributions, respectively. The fit to these data allows us to estimate \gamma =6.2 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K^{-2}, \beta=0.14 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K^{-4}, and A =0.49 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K. The value of \gamma is smaller than those found in the layered nickel borocarbide superconductors, e.g., LuNi_{2}B_{2}C (8.9 mJ mol-Ni^{-1} K^{-2}),[19] which also have significantly higher T_{c}s (16.5 K for LuNi_{2}B_{2}C). Given both \gamma and \chi_{0}, the Wilson ratio can be estimated for La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, yielding R_{W}=\frac{(\pi\mu_{0})^{2}\chi_{0}}{\lambda_{\mu_{0}^{2}\Delta\chi_{0}}}\approx 5 [\mu_{\rm eff}=2.76\times 10^{-21} erg/Oe was calculated from the \chi(T) fit of 50-350 K to Curie-Weiss law]. This is significantly higher than the free-electron value (R_{W} =1) and indicates a spin-enhanced susceptibility. The normalized specific-heat jump at T_{c} can also be calculated from \gamma. The experimental value for La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, \Delta C_{\rm el}/ \gamma T_{c}=1.25, is lower than the BCS prediction[20] of 1.43, likely due to the influence of the impurity phases on the measured \gamma. The simple Debye model connects the \beta coefficient and Debye temperature (\Theta_{D}) through \Theta_{D}=(\frac{12\mu^{4}}{S_{B}}nR)^{1/3}\approx 360 K, where R= 8.314 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}, \beta_{n}=4\beta=0.56 mJ mol K^{-4}, and n =13 for La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}. With this value for \Theta_{D}, we can estimate the electron-phonon coupling constant (\lambda_{\rm ep}) from McMillian's relation:[21]\lambda_{\rm ep}=\frac{1.04\mu_{\rm eff}

  the related Ni-based superconductors YNi_{2}B_{2}C (65 A) (Ref. [23]) and MgCNi_{3} (47 A).[24] The present analysis does not reveal any overtly unconventional behavior in La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} beyond the presence of a spin-enhanced susceptibility. While there is widespread belief that there is a relationship between superconductivity and magnetism in the Fe-based oxypnictides, early band-structure calculations on LaNiPO (Ref. [25]) have been interpreted as indicating that the nickel oxypnictides are conventional superconductors. The issue of conventional vs unconventional superconductivity in the Ni-based superconductors--the layered borocarbides and MgCNi_{3}--continues to be an open one, however. Arguments both for and against conventional superconductivity in this family, based on detailed experiments, continue to be presented.[19, 25, 26, 27, 28] Thus, future detailed characterization of the nickel-based oxypnictide superconductors BaNi_{2}P_{2}, La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2}, and LaNiPO will be of interest. The crystal structure of La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} is unique among the superconducting oxypnictides due to the asymmetric distribution of charge reservoir layers around the Ni_{2}P_{2} plane. For the one copper oxide superconductor in which a similar structural asymmetry is known, Y_{2}Ba_{4}Cu_{3}O_{15}, unexpected behavior has been predicted.[29] Whether this asymmetry may be the reason why the T_{c} in La_{3}Ni_{4}P_{4}O_{2} is approximately half that of BaNi_{2}P_{2} and LaNiPO is an issue that will require further study. The growth of single crystals will be required to provide more precise characterization of the normal state and superconducting properties.
