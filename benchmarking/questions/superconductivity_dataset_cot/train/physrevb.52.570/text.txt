###### Abstract

Ultrasonic and specific-heat measurements have been performed on single crystals of La2-x SrxCuO4 (LSCO) with \(x\) = 0.09, 0.14, and 0.19 across the superconducting transition temperature _T_c. We observed lamplike decreases in the longitudinal elastic moduli at _T_c, as are seen in conventional superconductors. Anisotropic strain dependence of _T_c was estimated from both the jump in the elastic moduli and specific heat at _T_c via the Ehrenfest relation. With further lowering temperature below _T_c, we found a pronounced lattice stiffening in the elastic moduli of LSCO, which contrasts with the continuous softening observed in most of the conventional superconductors. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the stiffening originates from the change in the superconducting condensation energy under the lattice strain. This unusual lattice stiffening in the superconducting state is possibly a common character of the high-_T_c copper oxides.

## 1 Introduction

Electron-phonon coupling plays a fundamental role in conventional superconductors. Phonons mediate an attractive interaction between electrons which leads to the formation of Cooper pairs. For high transition temperature (_T_c) oxide superconductors, it has been widely examined whether the electron-phonon coupling is essential to superconductivity.

Studies of superconductivity-induced changes in lattice properties provide a direct way to probe the relevant coupling of phonons with electrons. Measurements of ultrasonic sound velocity or elastic moduli in solids are one of the most sensitive methods to detect a change in the acoustic branch of dispersion in the low-frequency limit. Earlier ultrasonic studies1 have revealed that in Nb, Pb, and V the elastic moduli decrease by less than 0.01% when the sample is cooled to the superconducting state. Subsequently, Shapiro, Shirane, and Axe2 have shown by inelastic neutron scattering measurements for Nb that the phonon frequencies of the particular acoustic branch decrease by about 4% in the superconducting state. This lattice softening below _T_c is expected according to the calculation of the phonon self-energy by Schuster.3

In the high-_T_c oxide superconductors, changes of phonon frequencies in the superconducting state have been observed by Raman scattering, infrared reflection, and other techniques; the zone-center optic phonon mode at 330 cm-1 of YBa2Cu3O7 shows softening due to superconductivity, whereas the mode at 440 cm-1 shows stiffening in the superconducting state.4 These changes have been explained by the strong-coupling theory based on electron-phonon coupling.5 Recently, Normand, Kohno, and Fukuyama6 have provided a different interpretation on the viewpoint of spin-phonon coupling.

Lattice anomalies have been reported also in the normal state of the high-_T_c oxide superconductors. Raman spectra7 have exhibited an anomalous decrease of phonon frequency for YBa2Cu4O8 well above _T_c. Extended x-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS), ion channeling, and inelastic neutron diffraction have shown the existence of local lattice distortions8 due to the buckling motions of the CuO2 planes. Moreover, dynamical changes of the distortions9,10 due to the superconducting transition have been observed. Recently, we have found a novel lattice softening in the normal state of LSCO with \(x\) = 0.14 in a particular elastic modulus (_C_11 - \(C\)12)/2.11 The softening starts from a temperature appreciably above _T_c, which, however, turns to stiffening by the appearance of superconductivity.

La-214 compounds, La2-_x_M_xCuO4 (_M_ = Sr, Ba, etc.), are very well suited for the investigation of the relation between the lattice properties and high-_T_c superconductivity. The buckling structure of the CuO2 planes in which superconductivity occurs varies with temperature, doping, and other external parameters. In La2-_x_Sr_xCuO4 (LSCO), superconductivity appears in both the orthorhombic (OMT: space group _Bmab_. OMT denotes _orthorhombic_ at midtemperatures) and the tetragonal phases (THT: _14/mmm_. THT denotes _tetragonal_ at high temperatures). The OMT phase emerges as a result of a second-order structural phase transition accompanied by cooperative tilting of the CuO6 octahedra about either the [110] or [110] axis of the THT phase. La2-_x_Ba_xCuO4 exhibits an additional transformation12-14 from the OMT to a second tetragonal phase (TLT: \(P\)4/_ncm_. TLT denotes _tetragonal_ at low temperatures). A second orthorhombic phase (OLT: _P_ccn. OLT denotes _orthorhombic_ at low temperatures) appears in La2-_x_-_y_Nd_ySr_xCuO4.15 The superconducting transition temperature _T_c is considerably lower in the TLT and OLT phases only if the carrier concentration is \(p\) ~ 1/2.16 Thus, it indicates an intimate coupling between the lattice strains and superconductivity in this system.

 In this paper, we will present results of elastic-moduli and specific-heat measurements on single crystals of La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) with \(x=0.09\), 0.14, and 0.19. We observed anomalies around \(T_{c}\) in the longitudinal and transverse elastic moduli in various sound modes. The most peculiar feature observed is a pronounced increase of the elastic moduli at low temperatures. In striking contrast, the elastic moduli in conventional superconductors always decrease in the superconducting state.[1] We will show that the strain dependence of the superconducting condensation energy is crucial to the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli below \(T_{c}\).

The structure of the paper is as follows: The characterization of the samples and the experimental procedures are presented in Sec. II. The results of the specific-heat and elastic-moduli measurements are shown in Secs. III and IV, respectively. In Sec. V, we perform thermodynamical analysis of the elastic data to clarify the origin of the peculiar lattice stiffening. We conclude in Sec. VI.

## II Experimental

Large and high-quality single crystals of La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) with nominal Sr concentrations of \(x=0.09\), 0.14, and 0.19 were grown by a traveling-solvent floating-zone method.[17] The Sr concentrations of the samples were determined by using an electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) as summarized in Table I.

Because it is necessary for thermodynamic analysis of the ultrasonic data, we measured relative variation of isobaric specific heat \(c_{P}\) in detail by using an optical ac calorimeter (Sinku-Riko Inc, model ACC-VL1). The absolute values in \(c_{P}\) were calibrated by a conventional adiabatic calorimeter. Samples for the specific-heat measurements were cut from the crystals used for the ultrasonic measurements.

For ultrasonic measurements, the crystals were cut into parallelepipeds with (100) and (001) planes, and (110) and (001) planes. The dimensions of the samples are approximately 4\(\times\)4\(\times\)4 mm\({}^{3}\). Ultrasonic measurements were performed with a homemade apparatus based on a phase comparison method.[18] Ultrasound in the frequency range between 10 and 50 MHz was generated and detected by LiNbO\({}_{3}\) transducers glued onto parallel surfaces of a sample. In the present measurements, the relative resolution of the sound velocity \(v\) was typically \(\sim\!10^{-6}\). The velocity \(v\) was converted to the elastic moduli by the relation of \(C_{ii}\!=\!\rho v^{2}\) with mass density \(\rho\). In Table II, we list the measured elastic moduli along with corresponding sound-propagating direction (\(q\)), polarization (\(u\)), and lattice strains (\(\epsilon_{i}\)) induced by the sound wave. The measurements in a temperature range from 1.8 to 350 K were performed by using a \({}^{4}\)He cryostat. The measurements in each magnetic field were performed on cooling from well above \(T_{c}\) using a 16 T superconducting magnet system (Oxford Instruments).

## III Specific Heat

The specific heat \(c_{P}\) divided by \(T^{2}\) of La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of temperature. A change in \(c_{P}\) was observed around \(T_{c}\). In order to estimate a superconductivity-induced change \(\Delta c_{P}(T)\) in \(c_{P}\), we utilized a similar method adopted by Schnelle _et al._;[19] we fitted an expression of the total specific heat, which consists of a smooth background and a contribution from superconductivity, to the obtained data. In the present analysis we assumed the background specific heat \(c_{P}^{N}\) is expressed by a polynomial, which contains both the phonon and normal-electron contributions,

\[\frac{c_{P}^{N}}{T^{2}}=\sum_{k=-2}^{2}A_{k}T^{k}\ ,\] (1)  where \(A_{k}\) are fitting parameters listed in Table 3. The mean-field contribution from superconductivity was approximated by a two-fluid model:[20]

\[\Delta c_{P}(T) = - \frac{\Delta c_{P}(T_{e})}{2}\frac{T}{T_{e}}\,\left[1 - \frac{3T^{2}}{T_{e}^{2}}\right]\,.\] (2)

This choice of the model is just for simplification of the analysis, but our final conclusion does not depend critically on the model. The parameters \(A_{k}\) and the magnitude of the jump \(\Delta c_{P}(T_{e})\) were adjusted so as to fit our experimental data. The transition temperature \(T_{e}\) was estimated by an entropy balance so that the area-conserving rule is satisfied. The obtained background is represented by broken lines in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, we show the difference \(\Delta c_{P}/T\) after subtracting the background. The solid lines represent an estimated mean-field contribution. The values of \(T_{e}\) and \(\Delta c_{P}(T_{e})/T_{e}\) are summarized in Table 1. The magnitude of \(\Delta c_{P}(T_{e})/T_{e}\) is comparable to that of powder samples,[21, 22] suggesting the volume fractions of superconductivity of our samples are 60\(-\)70 %.

## IV Elastic Moduli

### Elastic anomalies around the structural phase transition

In Figs. 3 and 4 we show an overall temperature dependence of various elastic moduli in La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) with \(x=\) 0.09, 0.14, and 0.19. The most remarkable feature in the longitudinal modes is a large softening in \(C_{11}\) around the temperature as indicated by arrows in Fig. 3. This softening is due to the structural phase transition from the THT to the OMT phase at a transition temperature of \(T_{d}\). An anomaly is also seen in \(C_{33}\) around \(T_{d}\). For the transverse modes, a softening of \(\sim\) 70% was observed in \(C_{66}\) above \(T_{d}\) as seen in Fig. 4. This softening was analyzed by a two-dimensional Gaussian model,[23] as proposed by Migliori _et al.[24]_ The analysis allows us to determine \(T_{d}\) as \(\sim\) 300, \(\sim\) 200, and \(\sim\) 80 K for \(x=\) 0.09, 0.14, and 0.19, respectively. Below \(T_{d}\), measurements of \(C_{66}\) were prevented by heavy scattering of the sound wave of this particular mode by structural domain walls formed in the OMT phase. Changes in elastic moduli around \(T_{d}\) are also evident in \((C_{11}-C_{12})/2\) and \(C_{44}\) as seen from Fig. 4. Absolute values of the elastic moduli are listed in Table 4. Here, we employed the tetragonal representation for the elastic moduli even below \(T_{d}\) since the sample is in a pseudotetragonal lattice.

Phenomenological models of the structural phase transition have been discussed by many authors[13, 14, 25] for

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} Elastic moduli & Propagating direction & Polarization & Strain & Symmetry \(\Gamma\) \\ \(C_{11}\) & \(q\|[100]\) & \(u\|[100]\) & \(\varepsilon_{xx}\) & \(A_{1g}+B_{1g}\) \\ \(C_{33}\) & \(q\|[001]\) & \(u\|[001]\) & \(\varepsilon_{xx}\) & \(A_{1g}\) \\ \((C_{11}-C_{12})/2\) & \(q\|[1  La-214 compounds within the framework of the Landau free energies. Using the results given in Ref. 25, we consider the coupling term between the order parameter and lattice strains in the Landau free energies,

\[F_{C} = \gamma_{1}(\varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy})(Q_{1}^{2} + Q_{2}^{2}) + \gamma_{2}\varepsilon_{xx}(Q_{1}^{2} + Q_{2}^{2})\] (3) \[+ \gamma_{3}\varepsilon_{xy}(Q_{1}^{2} - Q_{2}^{2})\ ,\]

where \(Q_{1}\) and \(Q_{2}\) are the components of the order parameter and \(\gamma_{j}\) the coupling energies. The OMT phase is characterized by either \(Q_{1} \neq 0\) and \(Q_{2} = 0\), or \(Q_{1} = 0\) and \(Q_{2} \neq 0\), corresponding to the tilting of the CuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra around [110] or [1\(\bar{1}\)0] axes, respectively. The magnitudes of spontaneous strains which appear in the OMT phase, \(\varepsilon_{xx}^{S} + \varepsilon_{yy}^{S}\), \(\varepsilon_{zz}^{S}\), and \(\varepsilon_{xy}^{S}\), depend linearly on the coupling energies \(\gamma_{j}\) in Eq. (3). \(C_{11}\), \(C_{33}\), and \(C_{66}\) are the susceptibilities to \(\varepsilon_{xx}\), \(\varepsilon_{xx}\), and \(\varepsilon_{xy}\), respectively, because elastic moduli are second-order derivatives of free energy with respect to strain. The magnitude of softening of these elastic moduli at \(T_{d}\) depends quadratically on \(\gamma_{j}\).25

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} \(x\) & \(C_{11}\) & \(C_{33}\) & \((C_{11} - C_{12})/2\) & \(C_{44}\) & \(C_{66}\) \\
0.09 & 213.4 & 202.0 & 98.7 & 59.6 & 54.4 \\
0.14 & 263.8 & 246.8 & 98.8 & 66.4 & 66.4 \\
0.19 & 238.1 & 238.

  The significant softening observed in \(C_{11}\) and \(C_{66}\) suggests the first and last terms are dominant in Eq. (3). This is in accordance with the measurement of the lattice parameters in the OMT phase;[13, 26] a significant expansion is observed in the \(ab\) plane (i.e., \(\varepsilon_{xx}^{S}+\varepsilon_{yy}^{S}>0\)) together with the orthorhombic distortion (\(\varepsilon_{xy}^{S}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  grounds. For \(x=\)0.09, the data at 14 T itself are used for background since the fit with Eq. (4) was not satisfactory. The superconductivity-induced change, \(\Delta C_{33}=C_{33}(0T)\)\(-\)\(C^{N}\), is plotted in Fig. 9 as a function of temperature. Now it is clear that \(C_{33}\) exhibits negative jump at \(T_{c}\) and starts to increase at lower temperatures. We will discuss this anomalous temperature dependence of \(\Delta C_{33}\) in Sec. V.2.

In Fig. 6 we show the elastic modulus \(C_{11}\) for the longitudinal sound wave propagating along the [100] axis in LSCO under magnetic fields \(H\|c\). For \(x=\)0.19, a jump-like decrease is observed at \(T_{c}\) in the zero field. The jump at \(T_{c}\) is less obvious for \(x=\)0.09 and 0.14, likely due to the effects of domain structure formed in the OMT phase.

It is not straightforward to estimate a normal-state background \(C^{N}\) of this mode because of a coupling between the ultrasound and flux lines (FL's) in the mixed state. A field-induced enhancement of \(C_{11}\) is obvious at low temperatures as seen in Fig. 6. This enhancement is attributed to the elastic modulus of the FL's. Since the displacement (\(u\|[100]\)) in the sound wave of the \(C_{11}\) mode is perpendicular to the FL's (\(H\|[001]\)) in this configuration, the sound wave compresses (and expands) the FL's which are rigidly pinned to the crystal lattice below the irreversibility temperature \(T^{\star}\). Consequently, the compressional modulus of the FL's is superposed on the elastic modulus of the crystal lattice.[29] The compressional modulus of the FL's, \(\mu_{0}H^{2}\), gives an enhancement of the elastic modulus of \(\sim\)0.16 GPa for 14 T, consistent

  with the observation. A lack of such a field-induced enhancement in \(C_{33}\) under \(H\|c\) is natural because \(q\,\|H\) in the \(C_{33}\) mode and the sound wave does not deform the FL's.

The normal-state background \(C^{N}\) for \(x=\)0.09 and 0.19 was estimated in the same manner as we applied for the analysis of \(C_{33}\). The estimated \(C^{N}\) is shown in Fig. 6 by the broken lines. For \(x=\) 0.14, \(C_{11}\) exhibits slight softening below about 30 K in 14 T. Since we cannot apply Eq. (4) for an estimation of the background, \(C^{N}\) is assumed to follow an extrapolated curve shown by the broken line in Fig. 6. The superconductivity-induced changes \(\Delta C_{11}=C_{11}(0T)-C^{N}\) are plotted in Fig. 10 as a function of the temperature. The lattice stiffens in the superconducting state.

Figure 7 show the elastic modulus \(C_{44}\) for the transverse sound wave propagating along the [001] direction with the [100] polarization for \(x=\) 0.09, 0.14, and 0.19. No appreciable changes are seen at \(T_{c}\) within the experimental resolution (\(\Delta C_{ij}/C_{ij}\sim 10^{-6}\)). This suggests that the shear strain \(\epsilon_{xx}\), which slides the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes relative to each other, scarcely couples with the superconducting state.

In Fig. 8, we show the variation with temperature of the elastic modulus (\(C_{11}-C_{12}\))/2 for the transverse sound wave propagating along the [110] direction with the [110] polarization (_u_). The most remarkable feature is that only for \(x=\) 0.14 (\(C_{11}-C_{12}\))/2 starts to soften at a temperature around 50 K, which is substantially higher than \(T_{c}\), but shows a turn to a stiffening just below \(T_{c}\). A corresponding softening was not observed for \(x=\) 0.09 and 0.19. Thus the softening in the normal state is seen in a narrow range of \(x\) around the optimum doping.

This is different from the behavior of the other elastic modes which show no corresponding anomaly above \(T_{c}\) (see Figs. 5\(-\)7). It is clear that (\(C_{11}-C_{12}\))/2 continues to soften as long as the sample is in the normal state under magnetic fields up to 14 T along the \(c\) axis, which reduce \(T_{c}\) from 35 to 14 K. Therefore, the softening is an intrinsic property of the lattice in the normal state. The rapid recovery of stiffness starting just below \(T_{c}\) indicates a disappearance of the lattice instability in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane. Thus, there exists an interference between the lattice softening and superconductivity as we described in detail previously.[11] Aside from this unusual softening in the normal state, the lattice stiffening is also observed in this mode below \(T_{c}\) as is clear for \(x=\) 0.09 and 0.19.

## V Discussion

### Thermodynamics of elastic moduli in the superconducting state

Opposite to the behavior of conventional superconductors, the lattice of LSCO stiffens in the superconducting state as presented in Sec. IV. How can one understand this difference? A number of calculations are available to describe the change in the elastic moduli in the superconducting state.[30] Generally, these results are restricted to a mean-field treatment within a temperature range close to \(T_{c}\). In the following, we describe thermodynamic relations of elastic moduli applicable to all \(T<T_{c}\), which we will apply to the analysis of \(C_{ij}\) of LSCO.

Let us first consider the relations for the longitudinal elastic moduli. The difference in the Helmholtz free energy \(F\) per volume between the superconducting and normal states can be written as

\[\Delta F=F_{s}-F_{n}=-\frac{1}{2}\mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}\ ,\] (5)

where \(H_{c}\) is the thermodynamic critical field. The temperature dependence of the difference in longitudinal elastic moduli, \(\Delta C_{il}(T)\), is thermodynamically given as a second-order derivative of the difference in the Helmholtz free energy with respect to strain \(\epsilon_{i}\):

\[\Delta C_{il}(T)=-\mu_{0}\left[H_{c}\,\frac{d^{\,2}H_{c}}{d\epsilon_{i}^{2}}+ \,\left[\,\frac{dH_{c}}{d\epsilon_{i}}\,\right]^{2}\,\right]\ .\] (6)

The details were discussed by Seraphim and Marcus[31] to explain \(\Delta C_{il}(T)\) of superconducting tantalum. Temperature dependence of \(\Delta C_{il}(T)\) is represented more clearly when the difference in the Helmholtz fee energy is expressed in the form of

\[\Delta F=-\phi(\epsilon_{i})f\left[\,T/T_{c}(\epsilon_{i})\,\right]\ .\] (7)

Here \(f\) is a function of \(T/T_{c}\) normalized as \(f(0)=1\) and \(f(1)=0\), \(\phi=(\frac{1}{2})\mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}(0)\) is a superconducting condensation energy at \(T=\) 0, and only \(\phi\) and \(T_{c}\) depend on the lattice strains \(\epsilon_{i}\). The function \(f\) may be expressed by the BCS scaling, a two-fluid model, or other models, but the form of \(f\) is assumed to be independent of \(\epsilon_{i}\). Irrespective of the form of \(f\), the difference in the longitudinal elastic modulus in Eq. (6) is rewritten as[32]

Figure 10: **The difference in the longitudinal elastic modulus \(C_{11}\) (\(q\,|a\)) of La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) between the normal and superconducting states as a function of temperature. The broken lines represent a fit with a thermodynamic model.**

 \[\Delta C_{\mu}(T) = -\left[\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\epsilon_{i}}\right]^{2}\frac{T\Delta c_{p}(T)}{V_{\rm mol}}+AT\Delta s(T)\] (8) \[+\frac{1}{\phi}\frac{d^{2}\phi}{d\epsilon_{i}^{2}}\Delta F(T)\ ,\]

with

\[A=\frac{d^{2}\ln T_{c}}{d\epsilon_{i}^{2}}+2\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\epsilon_{i}} \frac{d\ln\phi}{d\epsilon_{i}}-\left[\frac{d\ln T_{c}}{d\epsilon_{i}}\right]^{2}\ .\] (9)

Here \(\Delta c_{p}/V_{\rm mol}\) and \(\Delta s\) are the differences of specific heat and entropy per volume, respectively. We used the molar volume \(V_{\rm mol}\) = 5.73, 5.71, and 5.70 x 10-5 m3/mol for \(x=\) 0.09, 0.14, and 0.19, respectively, based on the x-ray diffraction data near \(T_{c}\). Equation (8) reduces to the Ehrenfest relation for \(T\!=\!T_{c}\):

\[\left[\frac{dT_{c}}{d\epsilon_{i}}\right]^{2}=-\frac{V_{\rm mol}T_{c}\Delta C_{\mu}(T_{c})}{\Delta c_{p}(T_{c})}\ .\] (10)

The mean-field contribution gives a negative jump in \(C_{\mu}\) at \(T_{c}\) as shown schematically in Fig. 11 because the jump \(\Delta c_{p}\) in specific heat at \(T_{c}\) is always positive. At lower temperatures, the last term in Eq. (8) becomes dominant. The difference at \(T\!=\!0\) is related to the second-order strain dependence \(\Delta C_{\mu}(0)\!=\!d^{2}\phi/d\epsilon_{i}^{2}\). Thus, whether the lattice softens or stiffens in the superconducting state predominantly depends on the sign of \(d^{2}\phi/d\epsilon_{i}^{2}\). The negative value of \(d^{2}\phi/d\epsilon_{i}^{2}\) leads to a net stiffening, \(C_{\mu}(0)\!>\!C^{N}(0)\).

Next, the relations are somewhat modified for pure transverse elastic moduli \(C_{\Gamma}\), linear response to shear strain \(\epsilon_{\Gamma}\) with symmetry \(\Gamma\). The first-order derivatives of \(T_{c}\) and \(\phi\) with respect to \(\epsilon_{\Gamma}\) vanish in Eqs. (8) and (9) since \(+\,\epsilon_{\Gamma}\) and \(-\,\epsilon_{\Gamma}\) give the same energy state. The difference in \(C_{\Gamma}\) between the superconducting and normal states is given by

\[\Delta C_{\Gamma}(T)\!=\!\frac{1}{T_{c}}\frac{d^{2}T_{c}}{d\epsilon_{\Gamma}^{2}}\,T\Delta s(T)\!+\!\frac{1}{\phi}\frac{d^{2}\phi}{d\epsilon_{\Gamma}^{2}}\Delta F(T)\ .\] (11)

At \(T_{c}\), transverse elastic moduli exhibit no jump but a discontinuous change in the slope \(dC_{\Gamma}/dT\), which corresponds to \(\Delta c_{p}\) ( \(\propto T\partial\Delta s/\partial T\)):

\[\left.\frac{dC_{\Gamma}}{dT}\,\left|{}_{T_{c}^{+}}\!-\!\frac{dC_{\Gamma}}{dT}\,\right|{}_{T_{c}^{-}}\!=\!-\frac{\Delta c_{p}(T_{c})}{V_{\rm mol}T_{c}}\,\left[\frac{d^{2}T_{c}}{d\epsilon_{\Gamma}^{2}}+\cdots\right]\ .\right.\] (12)

Generally, \(d^{2}\phi/d\epsilon_{\Gamma}^{2}\) and \(d^{2}T_{c}/d\epsilon_{\Gamma}^{2}\) have the same sign since \(\phi\!=\!(\frac{1}{\phi})T_{c}^{2}(\Delta c_{p}(T_{c})/T_{c})\) and \(\Delta c_{p}(T_{c})/T_{c}\) depend little on \(\epsilon_{\Gamma}\). Therefore, lattice stiffening is expected if \(d^{2}\phi/d\epsilon_{\Gamma}^{2}\) is negative.

### Lattice stiffening in the superconducting state

In order to obtain a specific temperature dependence for elastic moduli in the superconducting state, we take a two-fluid form for the Helmholtz free energy in Eq. (7):

\[f=\{1-T^{2}/T_{c}^{2}(\epsilon_{i})\}^{2}\ .\] (13)

We performed a least-squares fit to determine the coefficients in each term in Eq. (8) for \(C_{11}\) and \(C_{33}\) noticing that \(\Delta C_{\mu}(T_{c})\!=\!-(dT_{c}/d\epsilon_{i})^{2}\Delta c_{p}(T_{c})/T_{c}V_{\rm mol}\), \(A\) and \(\Delta C_{\mu}(0)\!=\!-d^{2}\phi/d\epsilon_{i}^{2}\). The broken lines shown in Figs. 10 and 9 represent a fit with Eq. (8). It shows good agreement with the experimental data except for the region of the transition width. The estimated parameters are listed in Table 1.

As we have emphasized, the most remarkable feature is the unusual stiffening in the superconducting state. Furthermore, there exist indications that such a stiffening is common to the high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors. A similar stiffening has been reported for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6+y}\),[33] although the sample was polycrystalline. Ledbetter[34] has pointed out that in most of the high-\(T_{c}\) copper oxides, \(T_{c}\) increases as the Debye frequency increases. This correlation suggests that lattice stiffening is preferable for high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity. The different sign of \(d^{2}\phi/d\epsilon_{i}^{2}\) indicates that the copper oxides form a class of superconductors which involves different coupling between the lattice and electrons from that in conventional superconductors.

The second feature of interest is the magnitude of the stiffening \(\Delta C_{\mu}(0)\). \(\Delta C_{\mu}(0)\) for LSCO is much larger than those in conventional superconductors. For instance, \(\Delta C_{33}(0)/C_{33}\!\approx\!0.8\!\times\!10^{-3}\) for LSCO with \(x\!=\!0.14\) while \(10^{-5}\!-\!10^{-6}\) for conventional superconductors. This indi

Figure 11: Schematics of a variation of elastic moduli in the superconducting state. The longitudinal elastic moduli exhibit hardening below \(T_{c}\) when the second-order derivative \(d^{2}\phi/d\epsilon_{i}^{2}\) is negative, following the discontinuous jump at \(T_{c}\). No jump is seen at \(T_{c}\) in the transverse elastic moduli. The inset shows variations of the Helmholtz free energy \(F_{c}\) entropy \(s\), and specific heat \(c_{p}\) in the superconducting state.

  cates the phonons in LSCO are strongly affected by the change in the electronic state. Kresin [35] has pointed out the importance of the parameter D(0)/_E__F_, the gap energy divided by the Fermi energy. An analysis of the phonon self-energy leads to the expression for change in the elastic moduli in the superconducting state; [36]\(\Delta C_{ii}(0)/C_{ii}\!-\!\Delta(0)^{2}/E_{F}^{2}\). For the conventional superconductors, D ~ 1 meV and \(E_{F}\) = 5-10 eV lead to the correction of elastic modulus D_Ci_(0)/_C__ii_ ~ 10-7. On the other hand, D(0)/_E__F_ is much larger in the high-_T__c_ cuprates since D ~ 10 meV and \(E_{F}\) = 0.1-1 eV, which leads to D_Ci_(0)/_C__ii_ = 10-2-10-4, consistent with our observation.

### Uniaxial strain dependence of \(T_{c}\)

We determined strain dependence of \(T_{c}\) from the jump in elastic moduli and specific heat at \(T_{c}\) using Eq. (10) as summarized in Table 1. From elastic moduli, however, one can only determine the magnitude of \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}\). The sign of \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}\) must be determined consistently with other experiments. The strain dependence is related to the uniaxial pressure (\(P_{i}\)) dependence of \(T_{c}\) by the following formula:

\[\frac{dT_{c}}{d\varepsilon_{i}} = - \sum\limits_{j}C_{ij}\frac{dT_{c}}{dP_{j}}\ .\] (14)

Schnelle _et al._[19] obtained \(dT_{c}/dP_{ab}\!=\!+6.2\) K/GPa and \(dT_{c}/dP_{c}\!=\!-6.7\) K/GPa for La\({}_{1.88}\)Sr\({}_{0.12}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) from a thermal-expansion measurement. Maeno _et al._[37] reported \(dT_{c}/dP_{ab}\!=\!+3\) K/GPa and \(dT_{c}/dP_{c}\!=\!-2\) K/GPa from a thermal-expansion measurement for the same sample of La\({}_{1.86}\)Sr\({}_{0.14}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) that is used in the present work. A recent thermal-expansion measurement by Gugenberger _et al._[38] gives \(dT_{c}/dP_{a}\!=\!+2.5\) K/GPa, \(dT_{c}/dP_{b}\!=\!+4.9\) K/GPa, and \(dT_{c}/dP_{c}\!=\!-6.8\) K/GPa for x = 0.15. The signs of the pressure dependencies of \(T_{c}\) are opposite along the \(a\) and \(c\) axes, while the magnitude differs slightly. We obtained \(dT_{c}/dP_{i}\) using \(C_{j}\) reported in Ref. [24] as listed in Table 1. The obtained magnitude is in the same order with the reported values, suggesting the validity of our estimate of the jump D_C__ii_(\(T_{c}\)).

In LSCO, both \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{a}\) and \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{c}\) depend only weakly on \(x\) and hence on the carrier concentration as seen in Fig. 12. Results from the recent data [38] are shown together. In many oxide superconductors, the sign of the strain dependence of \(T_{c}\) depends on the carrier concentration \(p\) and where it is placed on the bell-shaped _T__c_-_p_ curve. This is because one of the dominant effects of the strain is a charge redistribution from the blocking layers to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes predominantly due to the contraction of the \(c\) axis. [39] This scenario successfully explains the pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) for YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{6+y}\), in which \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{c}\) is negative for the underdoped samples and is \(\sim\!0\) for the samples with optimized \(T_{c}\). [40, 41] In contrast, positive values of \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{c}\) regardless of doping \(x\) in LSCO suggest an importance of other effects than the charge redistribution.

The strain dependence of \(T_{c}\) in LSCO is possibly dominated by a coupling between strains and tilting of the CuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra. Yamada and Ido [42] claimed from thermal-expansion measurements under hydrostatic pressure that \(T_{c}\) increases when the tilting of the CuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra is reduced. The reduction of the tilting accompanies a contraction of the _ab_ plane (\(\varepsilon_{ab}\!<\!0\)) and an expansion of the \(c\) axis (\(\varepsilon_{c}\!>\!0\)) as we discussed in Sec. IV.1. Therefore, \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{ab}\!<\!0\) and \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{c}\!>\!0\) obtained in this study support the dependence of \(T_{c}\) on the tilting. The coupling between the tilting of the CuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra and superconductivity is also suggested by neutron and thermal-expansion measurements in La\({}_{1.87}\)Sr\({}_{0.13}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (Ref. [26]). According to a band calculation, [43] the tilting about the [110] axis causes little change in the electronic structure around the Fermi level; however, it is plausible that a change in Cu-O bond angles and lengths by the tilting alters the electronic correlations and changes \(T_{c}\).

## VI Conclusions

The high quality single crystals, high-resolution sound-velocity measurements, and strong magnetic fields allowed us to explore the peculiar features in the elastic properties of La\({}_{2-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\)CuO\({}_{4}\). We measured both the elastic moduli and specific heat for \(x\) = 0.09, 0.14, and 0.19. From the jumplike decrease in the longitudinal elastic moduli \(C\)33 and \(C\)11 and the specific-heat jump at \(T_{c}\), we estimated the anisotropic strain dependence of \(T_{c}\). The values of \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}\) (_i_ = _ab_ and _c_) are almost independent of the doping \(x\). This suggests that the charge transfer from the blocking layers to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes is not the origin of the strain dependence of \(T_{c}\). The opposite signs of \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{ab}\) and \(dT_{c}/d\varepsilon_{c}\) are attributed to the tilting of the CuO\({}_{6}\) octahedra induced by the lattice strains \(\varepsilon_{i}\).

Thermodynamic analysis was developed to explain the

Figure 12: Anisotropic strain dependencies \(d\ln T_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}\) (_i_ = _ab_ and _c_) calculated from D_Ci_(\(T_{c}\)) and D_c_(\(T_{c}\)) via the Ehrenfest relation. For comparison we show the \(d\ln T_{c}/d\varepsilon_{i}\) estimated from Ref. [38].

  temperature dependence of the elastic moduli of superconducting LSCO. The anomalous increase of the elastic moduli at low temperatures is ascribed to the strain dependence of the superconducting condensation energy \(\phi\); \(d^{2}\phi/d\varepsilon_{l}^{2}\) is negative in LSCO while positive in most of the conventional superconductors. Understanding of the physical implication of these second-order derivatives may involve a proper treatment of lattice inharmonicity. Although the microscopic origin of the lattice stiffening in the superconducting state still remains to be investigated, we believe this finding provides an important key for the mechanism of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity.
