28 August 200920092 would imply that the Fermi velocity is _larger_
along the c axis than along the a axis. Thus, we are in presence of a
paradox. As sketched in the inset of each panel, the topology of the
Fermi surface extracted from the two methods of analysis are at odd with
each other.

This anomalous discrepancy is highlighted in Table 1, which compares the
case of URu₂Si₂ with another well-documented heavy-Fermion
superconductor UPt₃.[18] Charge conductivity and superconducting
coherence length extracted from the slope of H_(c2) near T_(c) are both
anisotropic in UPt₃. However, there is an excellent compatibility
between $\frac{\xi_{c}}{\sigma_{c}^{2}}$ =1.64 extracted from
$\frac{\xi_{c}}{\xi_{c}}$ and $\frac{\nu_{f}^{2}}{\nu_{f}^{2}}$=1.61
extracted from $(\frac{\xi_{c}}{\sigma_{c}})^{1/2}$. In URu₂Si₂, on the
other hand, the ratio of the Fermi velocities obtained by these two
alternative methods differs by a factor of four (0.35 vs 1.48). The
intimate link between $\frac{\xi_{c}}{\xi_{c}}$,
$\frac{\sigma_{c}}{\sigma_{c}}$, and $\frac{\nu_{f}^{2}}{\nu_{f}^{2}}$
is at the origin of a general rule. In different families of anisotropic
superconductors, the upper critical field is larger when the field is
oriented along the more conducting orientation. URu₂Si₂, in company of
NpPd₃Al₂,[19, 20] are the only two superconductors we know to disobey
this rule. We will argue below that the absence of a single
characteristic energy is at the heart of this apparent discrepancy.

Is the ground state of URu₂Si₂ in absence of superconductivity a Fermi
liquid? The answer to this question has been hindered by the presence of
a large transverse magnetoresistance. In clean samples of this low
density and compensated system, even a modest transverse magnetic field
leads to an upturn in resistivity.[12] In order to probe the system
without being overwhelmed by the large transverse magnetoresistance, we
measured resistivity of both samples in presence of a magnetic field
oriented _parallel_ to the current. The results are presented in Fig. 2
and reveal a qualitative difference

between the two orientations of charge flow. Resistivity along the a
axis, ρ_(a), is T-linear down to the superconducting transition both at
zero field and in presence of a field as strong as 12 T (the largest
used in this study), with no visible change in slope. On the other hand,
for a current along the c axis, with the application of a magnetic field
strong enough to destroy superconductivity, a T-square behavior emerges
as the asymptotic temperature dependence of ρ_(c) in the T=0 limit. Note
that this qualitative difference cannot be detected in the absence of
magnetic field.

Figure 3 presents the thermoelectric data. At zero field, in agreement
with previous studies,[10, 16] the Seebeck coefficient is negative and
anisotropic. It is roughly twice larger along the c axis than along the
a axis. With the application of a magnetic field, a qualitative
distinction emerges between the two orientations. For a heat current
flowing along the c axis, the Seebeck coefficient, S_(c) remains
negative and T-linear even in presence of a magnetic field strong enough
to destroy superconductivity. On the other hand, in the case of a
current flowing along the a axis, as the applied field is enhanced, the
Seebeck coefficient shows a downward deviation from a T-linear
dependence and finally it changes sign below 0.8 K, when the magnetic
field is strong enough to push T_(c) below this.

The difference between the two orientations is summarized in Fig. 4
which compares resistivity and thermopower. When the current flows along
the c axis, resistivity is T-square and thermopower is T-linear. A
finite negative S_(c)/T can be easily estimated. Its magnitude is
slightly enhanced in presence of a field, which destroys
superconductivity. The situation is drastically different for a current
flowing along the a axis. The Seebeck coefficient changes sign revealing
a positive contribution rapidly enhancing with decreasing temperature.
Note that superconducting transitions in S(T) and ρ almost coincide each
time and the 12 T curves show that the sign change of S is a
normal-state property and unrelated to the superconducting transition.

Table 1 compares the magnitude of the Fermi-liquid parameters extracted
for the c axis configuration in URu₂Si₂ to those known for UPt₃.[18] The
prefactor of T-square resistivity URu₂Si₂ obtained here, combined with
the reported value of the T-linear specific heat, γ (Ref. [9]) yields a
Kadowaki-Woods (KW) ratio which is 5.2 times larger than the "universal"
value (a₀=10 μΩ cm mol² K² J⁻²) and 17 times larger than the KW ratio
along c axis in UPt₃. This is not surprising as the KW ratio is expected
to increase as the carrier density is reduced.[21, 22] The T-linear
Seebeck coefficient for the c-axis configuration in URu₂Si₂ is more than
twice larger than what was found in the case of UPt₃.[23] In other
words, while the electronic entropy _per volume_ (measured by the size
of γ) is seven times larger in UPt₃, the entropy _per carrier_ is 2.5
times larger in URu₂Si₂. The dimensionless ratio of thermopower to
electronic specific heat, q=$\frac{SN_{3}e^{c}}{T\gamma}$ is 11, an
order of magnitude larger than what is commonly found in various metals
with a half-filled band[24] and 18 times than in UPt₃, another
consequence of a small carrier density.

The in-plane configuration is more enigmatic and remains beyond a simple
Fermi-liquid picture. As seen in Fig. 4, below 4 K, ρ_(a) is well
described by ρ_(a)=ρ₀+BT at all fields and the magnitude of T-linear
coefficient (B=1.8 μΩ cm K⁻¹) shows little change from 0 to 12 T. Note
that this does not necessarily imply that the T-linear behavior would
survive down to zero temperature when the magnetic field exceeds H_(c2).
An eventual emerging T² behavior, however, would be restricted to a
narrow temperature window and associated with a very large prefactor,
pointing to a small characteristic energy scale, much smaller than the
one associated with the c axis. This singular case of anisotropic
electron-electron scattering is to be linked with the anomalous
anisotropy of the superconducting coherence length and calls for a deep
theoretical attention. According to our results, the Cooper pairs extend
over a longer distance in the basal plane, which

(b) along the a axis. In panel b, dotted vertical lines mark the

conducts less but is host to the enhanced scattering among electrons.

A link between pairing and T-linear resistivity has been detected in
several families of unconventional superconductors.[25] In URu₂Si₂,
future transport measurements under pressure and magnetic field would
allow to determine the profile of the inelastic scattering beyond the
critical pressure destroying both the hidden order and
superconductivity.[7, 26] In cuprate superconductors, resistivity
becomes purely T², when superconductivity is destroyed by
overdoping.[27] But, at lower doping levels, the resistivity of the
ground state recovered by field-induced destruction of superconductivity
always contains a T-linear component.[28] CeRhIn₅ is another relevant
case. While a Fermi-liquid behavior emerges at low enough temperatures,
the pressure-induced destruction of superconductivity is also
accompanied by a drastic reduction in the electron-electron
scattering.[29]

The temperature dependence of the in-plane Seebeck coefficient is more
complex. The sign change suggests the presence of a positive and
continuously increasing S/T superposed on a constant negative one.
Theoretically, in presence of quantum criticality, S/T is expected to
follow γ and logarithmically diverge,[30] but what has been found in the
case of CeCoIn₅ (Ref. [31]) is not as simple. Qualitatively, the
low-temperature departure from a T-linear thermopower confirms a reduced
in-plane energy scale. Experiments at higher fields and lower
temperatures are required, however, to pin down the asymptotic
zero-temperature behavior of the Seebeck coefficient as well as its
magnitude and sign for the in-plane configuration.

In summary, our transport measurements show that the electronic
properties in URu₂Si₂ lack a single Fermi-liquid energy scale for all
directions. This may be the key to explain the anomalous anisotropy of
the superconducting coherence length.
