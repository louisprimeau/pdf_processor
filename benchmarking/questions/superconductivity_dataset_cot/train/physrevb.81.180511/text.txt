###### Abstract

We have studied the effect of Ge substitution and pressure on the heavy-fermion superconductor CePt\({}_{3}\)Si. Ge substitution on the Si site acts as negative chemical pressure leading to an increase in the unit-cell volume but also introduces chemical disorder. We carried out electrical resistivity and ac heat-capacity experiments under hydrostatic pressure on CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{1-x}\)Ge\({}_{x}\) (\(x\)=0,0.06). Our experiments show that the suppression of superconductivity in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{1-x}\)Ge\({}_{x}\) is mainly caused by the scattering potential, rather than volume expansion, introduced by the Ge dopants. The antiferromagnetic order is essentially not affected by the chemical disorder.

## I Introduction

The superconductivity in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{1-x}\)Ge\({}_{x}\) is mainly caused by the scattering potential, rather than volume expansion, introduced by the Ge dopants. The antiferromagnetic order is essentially not affected by the chemical disorder.

 high temperatures. The position of the high-\(T\) shoulder is nearly independent of pressure, which indicates that the overall CEF splitting is not changing significantly in the pressure range up to 2 GPa. On the other hand, the low-\(T\) shoulder shifts strongly to higher temperature with increasing pressure and finally merges with the high-\(T\) shoulder. This behavior is typical for Ce-based Kondo-lattice compounds where \(T_{K}\) generally increases with pressure. Although, the overall pressure and temperature dependence of the resistivity is similar for both, pure and Ge-substituted CePt\({}_{3}\)Si, the low-\(T\) shoulder depends much stronger on pressure in case of CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{0.94}\)Ge\({}_{0.06}\) At 1.31 GPa, a clear local shoulder at low temperatures is still apparent in the Ge-substituted compound, while in the case of pure CePt\({}_{3}\)Si it has already merged with the high-\(T\) shoulder. Thus the pressure response of \(T_{K}\) in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{0.94}\)Ge\({}_{0.06}\) exceeds the one in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si.

At \(p\)=0, CePt\({}_{3}\)Si and CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{0.94}\)Ge\({}_{0.06}\) order antiferromagnetically at \(T_{N}\)=2.2 and 2.8 K, before becoming SC at \(T_{c}\)=0.75 K and 0.29 K, respectively.[11] A smooth change in the curvature indicates the onset of antiferromagnetic (AF) order in \(\rho(T)\). The inflection point of \(\rho(T)\) agrees well with \(T_{N}\) obtained from specific-heat data [cf. inset of Fig. 1(b)]. In the following we define \(T_{N}\) from the inflection point in \(\rho(T)\). \(T_{N}(p)\) is suppressed with increasing pressure. Above \(p^{*}\)\(\approx\) 0.6 GPa, no signature of the AF transition is observed anymore in either \(\rho(T)\) or \(C(T)\) data, suggesting a sudden suppression of \(T_{N}(p)\) in both materials. For CePt\({}_{3}\)Si similar results have been reported previously.[9; 10] Consistent with the stronger pressure dependence of \(T_{K}\) in the Ge-substituted system, the absolute value of its slope \(|dT_{N}(p)/dp|_{p=0}\) is larger than that of the stoichiometric compound \([dT_{N}(p)/dp|_{p=0}\)=\(-\)1.2 K/GPa and \(-\)0.94 K/GPa, respectively].

Figure 2 shows the results of a fit of \(\rho(T)\)=\(\rho_{0}\)+\(A^{\prime}T^{\prime}\) to the low-\(T\) resistivity data (\(T_{c}\) \(\leq\) \(T\) \(\leq\) min\(\{T_{N},4\) K). As expected, the alloying-induced disorder causes an increase in the residual resistivity, \(\rho_{0}\), by a factor of about 4 from CePt\({}_{3}\)Si to CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{0.94}\)Ge\({}_{0.06}\). For both samples \(\rho_{0}(p)\) is nearly pressure independent; only a weak decrease is observed for the Ge-substituted sample. Especially, there is no feature in \(\rho_{0}(p)\) at \(p^{*}\) where the AF order disappears. \(\rho(T)\) follows a \(T^{2}\) behavior inside the AF state. Simultaneously with the loss of the signature of the Neel transition in resistivity and heat capacity, the temperature dependence of \(\rho\) changes drastically for both compounds in that the pressure dependence of resistivity exponent \(n(p)\) exhibits a sharp step from \(n\) \(\approx\) 2 below

In addition to the results from this work, for CePt\({}_{3}\)Si data from Ref. [8] has been analyzed (diamonds). The vertical dotted line delineates the border between the AF and the PM regions. Dashed lines are guides to the eye.

  \(=0.6\) GPa to \(\approx\) 1.3 at higher pressure. Therefore, the heavy Fermi-liquid (FL) phase (\(n\) = 2) at low pressure becomes unstable against a non-Fermi-liquid phase (\(n\) < 2), which exists in the whole pressure range \(p^{*}\) < \(p\) \(\equiv\) 1.88 GPa, the highest pressure in our experiment. In the FL phase \(A^{\prime}\) is a measure of the effective quasiparticle-quasiparticle (QP-QP) scattering cross section. \(A^{\prime}\) stays constant in the AF phase and, therefore, the QP-QP scattering cross section does not change. In particular, there is no divergence of the QP-QP scattering rate or a strong increase in \(\rho_{0}(p)\) as it might be expected on approaching a quantum critical point.

The results of our experiments are summarized in the phase diagram displayed in Fig. 3. \(T_{c,\rho}\) onset and \(T_{c,\rho}\) final are taken as the temperatures where the resistivity is reduced to 90% and 10% of its value in the normal state, respectively. In CePt\({}_{3}\)Si, \(T_{c,\rho}\) final extrapolates to \(T\)= 0 at about \(p\) = 1.8 GPa. Whereas \(T_{c}\) is suppressed upon increasing pressure, the resistive transition successively broadens, i.e., from \(\Delta T\) = \(T_{c,\rho}\) onset\(-T_{c,\rho}\) final= 105 mK at 0 GPa to \(\Delta T\)=420 mK at 1.56 GPa. Compared with CePt\({}_{3}\)Si the SC state in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{0.94}\)Ge\({}_{0.06}\) responds more sensitively to external pressure. At 0.24 GPa, no \(\rho\)=0 state is observed any more, but the onset of the SC transition in resistivity is still visible up to 1.03 GPa. No surprise, for the alloy, the resistive transition at ambient pressure is found to be already rather broad, \(\Delta T\) = 325 mK. A recent neutron Lamor-diffraction study on high-quality single-crystalline CePt\({}_{3}\)Si evidenced a wide distribution of lattice constants of \(\approx\) 10\({}^{-3}\), which might be interpreted as a wide range of effective pressures across the sample volume. Consequently, a substantial width of \(\Delta T\) is already observed in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si.[13]

Considering the domelike shape of the SC phase often observed in a \(T\)-\(p\) phase diagram in HF superconductors, CePt\({}_{3}\)Si seems to be situated close to the \(T_{c}\) maximum which occurs at a hypothetical minor negative pressure.[11] The small initial slope of \(T_{c}(p)\) suggests that the maximum \(T_{c}\) exceeds \(T_{c}\) at ambient pressure only slightly. It is important to note that substituting Si by isoelectronic Ge expands the unit-cell volume without changing the electronic structure significantly.[11]

Doping with 6% Ge leads to an increase in the unit-cell volume, \(V\), of \(=\)0.38% compared with the stoichiometric compound. Using the bulk modulus \(B\) = 162 GPa,[14] this converse of \(\Delta p\) = \(-\)0.6 GPa, resulting in a reduction in \(T_{c}\) and an increase in \(T_{N}\). Since the volume expansion reduces the 4\(f\)-conduction electron hybridization and, this way, strengthens the RKKY interaction (while weakening the Kondo effect), the observed dependence of \(T_{N}\) on the unit-cell volume can be easily explained. Since the partial Ge substitution for Si should have no significant effect on the local environment of the Ce\({}^{3+}\) ions, it can be expected that disorder has only a minor influence on the magnetic properties in this material.

The consequence of adding a nonmagnetic impurity in a noncentrosymmetric superconductor is far from being obvious. Theoretical analysis shows that adding nonmagnetic impurities results,[15] for weak disorder, in the suppression of \(T_{c}\) for _both_ conventional as well as unconventional Cooper pairing. Moreover, for the conventional Cooper pairing, nonmagnetic impurities yield a decrease in \(T_{c}\); superconductivity, _however_, will not be destroyed completely. This is because the origin of the suppression of \(T_{c}\) is interband impurity scattering which tends to reduce the difference between the gap magnitudes in the two bands. This costs energy and thus suppresses \(T_{c}\). However, once both gaps have become equal, adding further impurities should be harmless for superconductivity, which is in striking contrast to our observation that

[17]). Triangles correspond to \(T_{c}\) of Ge-substituted samples while circles present \(T_{c}\) of CePt\({}_{3}\)Si. Ambient pressure data is indicated by filled symbols while data under applied pressure by open symbols. \(T_{c}\) of the Ge-substituted samples at \(p\) =0 is taken from Ref. [11]. The solid line represents a fit to the data according to the AG function. The dashed and dashed-dotted lines are suggesting the shape of the SC dome for CePt\({}_{3}\)Si and CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{0.94}\)Ge\({}_{0.06}\), respectively, for the case that the SC behavior would be only governed by volume effects. See text for details.

  superconductivity is completely suppressed for a doped sample of 10% Ge.[11] Thus, the latter observation points toward an unconventional symmetry of the Cooper pairing in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si, involving lines of nodes. The particular symmetry of the order parameter is not yet known in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si, however, line nodes occur for any of the \(A_{2}\), \(B_{1}\), or \(B_{2}\) of the \(C_{4v}\) group. Then, for all types of unconventional pairing, the suppression of \(T_{c}\) is described by the universal Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) function,[16] In\(\frac{T_{c}}{T_{c0}}\)=\(\Psi(\frac{1}{2})\)\(-\)\(\Psi(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{a}{2\ln\mu_{T}})\), where \(T_{c0}\) is the SC transition temperature without impurities and \(\alpha\)=\(\frac{h}{2\tau}\) is the pair-breaking parameter. Here, \(\tau^{1}\)=\(2\,m_{imp}N(0)\)/\((2)\) is the inverse collision time resulting for the impurity potential with \(n_{imp}\) being the impurity concentration, \(N(0)\) is the density of states at the Fermi level, and \(I\) is the scattering potential.

The solid line in Fig. 4 shows the fit of the AG function to our experimental results as a function of \(n_{imp}\) and assuming \(N(0)\)/\(t^{2}\)\(\sim\)\(1.6\times 10^{-4}\) eV. The agreement between our experimental data and the AG theory clearly points toward the unconventional symmetry of the SC order parameter in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si which is destroyed by nonmagnetic impurities. In addition, we find that the strength of the potential scattering off the Ge dopants, rather than the Ge-induced expansion of the average unit-cell volume, more strongly affects \(T_{c}\), quite opposite to the response of \(T_{N}\) to these parameters.

On applying pressure the SC state in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{0.94}\)Ge\({}_{0.06}\) is suppressed already at a small pressure of only 0.2 GPa. The pressure dependence of \(T_{c}\) is much stronger than in the case of CePt\({}_{3}\)Si. Especially, \(T_{c}\)(\(p\)) does not exhibit an initial increase as one would expect it in the simple picture which was first suggested by combining the \(p\)=0 results on CePt\({}_{3}\)Si\({}_{1-x}\)Ge\({}_{x}\) and the pressure studies on CePt\({}_{3}\)Si in a \(T\)-\(V\) phase diagram (see also Fig. 4).[11] Our results, however, suggest that the effect of nonmagnetic impurities on the superconductivity cannot be neglected.

In conclusion, our results show that the suppression of \(T_{c}\) on Ge substitution in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si is basically not due to a volume effect but is caused by scattering processes on nonmagnetic impurities introduced by the Ge substitution. We have argued that the peculiar effect of nonmagnetic impurities in noncentrosymmetric superconductors plays an important role in destroying superconductivity in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si. In addition, we have shown that the SC state in the Ge-substituted sample is much more sensitive to pressure than in CePt\({}_{3}\)Si.
