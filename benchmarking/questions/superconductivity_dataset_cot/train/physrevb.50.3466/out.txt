###### Abstract

The pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of simple-cubic Na2CsC60 is studied by an ac susceptibility method with a Swenson-type piston-cylinder apparatus. The observed value of _dT__c_/_dP_ is -12.5+-0.2 K/GPa, significantly larger than the values of -7.8 and -9.7 K/GPa reported earlier for K3C60 and Rb3C60, respectively. Using the compressibility available (that of K3C60), we find that the evolution of T_{c} with interfullerene spacing in Na2CsC60 is significantly different from that established for merohedrally disordered face-centered-cubic superconductors M3C60 (_M_ = alkali metal), but in excellent agreement with the ambient pressure data for the simple cubic superconductors Na2RbC60 and Na2CsC60. The present results provide an additional dimension to the existing features of fulleride superconductors, establishing the importance of the relative orientation of C603- ions in affecting the electronic and conducting properties of these materials.

Since the discovery of relatively high-temperature superconductivity in alkali-metal-doped M3C60 compounds,1-3 a large amount of experimental and theoretical work4 has been devoted to the understanding of the properties of these novel molecular solids. At present, the highest reported superconducting transition temperature T_{c} stands at 33 K, observed in the RbCs2C60 compound.5 Such a high T_{c} is only surpassed by the cuprate superconductors. What is most striking for the superconductivity in these systems is the existence of a simple monotonic relation between T_{c} and the unit cell size (or intermolecular spacing), observed both at ambient pressure for a number of mixed metal M3-_M tant to understand such an anomalous feature for elucidating the superconductivity in C60-based superconductors.

These considerations motivated the present work in which we address the relation between T_{c} and lattice constant for simple-cubic fullerides by measuring the evolution with pressure of the superconducting properties of Na2CsC60.

In this paper we will explain the apparent paradox of the anomalous T_{c} for the Rb and normal T_{c} of the Cs isostructural samples, that is, there exist _two_ universal curves, describing the dependence of T_{c} on the interfullerene spacing: one for fcc and another much steeper for simple cubic fullerides, with the differences arising through the changed orientational state of the fulleride ions.

The Na2CsC60 sample was prepared by reaction of stoichiometric quantities of C60, Na, and Cs, contained in a tantalum cell inside a sealed glass tube filled with He to 600 Torr, at 200 degC for 12 h and at 430 degC for three weeks with intermittent shaking. Phase purity was confirmed by x-ray-diffraction measurements. The sample was superconducting with a T_{c} of 12 K and a superconducting volume fraction of more than 59% measured with a superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometer. A Rb3C60 superconductor with a T_{c} of 29.5 K was also prepared as a reference sample for comparisons with published high-pressure data. For the pressure work, the technique using a Swenson-type piston-cylinder apparatus was employed. The T_{c} under pressure was determined with an ac susceptibility method using the primary and secondary coils wound around the sample. The frequency of the magnetic field was 923 Hz. The data were collected as output signal of a lock-in amplifier. Nearly hydrostatic pressure was retained in a Teflon cell filled with a fluid pressure transmitting medium (mixture of Fluorinert FC70 and FC77). The force applied to the high-pressure apparatus was controlled not to change during the measurements on cooling and heating, that is, these measurements were performed always at constant pressure. The reproducibility of the present ac susceptibility data was checked by repeating the measurements at each pressure three times.

Figure 1 shows the ac magnetic susceptibility, \chi, of the present Na2CsC60 sample as a function of temperature in a pressure range from 0.2 to 0.6 GPa. No transition to a superconducting state was observed at 0.8 GPa down to 2 K. The pressure dependence of T_{c} is presented in Fig. 2. The error bars in the temperature in Figs. 2 and 3 represent the scatter of the data for triply-performed measurements. As it can be seen, T_{c} varies linearly up to 0.6 GPa with a slope of dT_{c}/dP\!=\!-12.5\!\pm\!0.2 K/GPa. This value is considerably larger than the values of -7.8 and -9.7 K/GPa,7 reported for K3C60 and Rb3C60, respectively. Figure 2 shows unequivocally the larger dT_{c}/dP in Na2CsC60 than the counterpart on the fcc fullerides. At present, the compressibility of Na2CsC60 is not known, and thus we cannot derive the relation between the T_{c} and the lattice constant at the various applied pressures directly from the present experimental re

  sults. However, to a first approximation, we can obtain an estimate of the lattice constant of Na_{2}CsC_{60} at elevated pressures by using the linear compressibility value, -d\ln a/P (a= lattice constant), of 1.2 x 10^{-2} GPa^{-1}, measured for K_{3}C_{60}.[8] In this way, the lattice constants at each pressure can be derived. In Fig. 3, the T_{c} is observed at each pressure are plotted against the lattice constant values, together with the present high-pressure results on Rb_{3}C_{60} and earlier values on various superconducting M_{3}C_{60} (or M_{3-x}M_{x}^{\prime}C_{60}) fullerides.[8, 10] It is clearly seen that the relation between T_{c} and the lattice constant in Na_{2}CsC_{60} is markedly different from the one established in merohedral fcc fullerides. Yet it coincides exactly with the line obtained at ambient pressure for simple-cubic Na_{2}CsC_{60} and Na_{2}RbC_{60} (shown by a solid line in Fig. 3).

We believe that this agreement is not fortuitous, although the exact value of the Na_{2}CsC_{60} compressibility is currently unknown. We do not expect it to be substantially different from the value assumed in the present study, as can be inferred from several high-pressure studies of fullerene solids.[15]^{-}[18] High-pressure work on pristine C_{60} established[17] that the compressibility of -d\ln V/dP = 5.5 x 10^{-2} GPa^{-1} reported earlier[15, 16] was for the simple cubic phase of the materials. Moreover, Samara _et al._[17] concluded that the compressibility of the fcc and sc were not too different. More detailed measurements[19] later established that the compressibility of the fcc is roughly 30% larger than that of the sc phase. As a result, we can conclude that the compressibility of the fullerene solids is only weakly dependent on the orientation of the C_{60} molecules in the solid. Thus, we can conclude that our approximation that the compressibility of Na_{2}CsC_{60} is of the same order of magnitude as that of K_{3}C_{60} is reasonable. As fcc phases appear to be somewhat softer than sc ones,[19] agreement of the present high-pressure data with the ambient pressure ones could be even better. Thus the transition temperatures of the fcc fullerides and the sc fullerides follow their own relations different to each other but common in the fullerides having the same structures.

Originally Na_{2}RbC_{60} was assumed to be an "anomalous" fullerene superconductor, and much effort was spent in an attempt to understand its behavior, which was thought to provide an important clue for the mechanism of superconductivity in these systems. The question arises about whether or not the density of state at the Fermi surface is an important controlling factor for T_{c}. Our present experiments clearly establish the existence of simple "universal" relation between T_{c} and interfullerene spacings for _all_ alkali-metal intercalated C_{60} superconductors; the different structural families characterized by the different orientational states of the C_{60}^{3-} ions only give rise to different dT_{c}/da (a= lattice constant) gradients. Thus the unexpectedly low T_{c} of Na_{2}RbC_{60} should result from the much steeper dependence of N(E_{F}) (and/or electron-phonon coupling V) on the intermolecular separation in sc than in fcc fullerides. Recent theoretical calculations by Hamada[20] within the framework of the tight-binding approximation have shown that indeed N(E_{F}) for a sc structure is more sensitive to lattice constant variations than for a fcc structure, entirely consistent with the results of the present experiments. In addition, the position of Na_{2}CsC_{60} on the universal curve of the fcc fullerides is wholly fortuitous. By taking into account the tight-binding calculations,[20, 21] which indicate that N(E_{F}) is higher for a sc structure than for a fcc one, a strong possibility is then that the fortuitous position of Na_{2}CsC_{60} arises from the compensating effects of a slightly reduced electron-phonon coupling constant V, originating through the stronger influence of the Na^{+} ions on the C_{60} geometry.[14] Recent neutron-inelastic-measurements on Na_{2}RbC_{60} and Na_{2}CsC_{60} (Ref. 22) seem to give support for such a hypothesis, but additional accurate experimental and theoretical studies of N(E_{F}) and V are certainly needed.

In conclusion, we have unraveled a relationship between the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} and the lattice constant in alkali-metal intercalated C_{60} compounds by applying pressure on the Na_{2}CsC_{60} superconductor having a simple cubic structure (space group Pa\,\overline{3}) at ambient pressure. T_{c} is found to have a substantially steeper dependence on the lattice constant in a simple cubic structure when compared with the face centered cubic structure (space group Fm\,\overline{3}m ) fulleride superconductors. The present results provide us with two important insights. First, the intuitive expectation based on a BCS

The solid line is obtained by connecting the data points at ambient pressure for Na_{2}RbC_{60} and Na_{2}CsC_{60}.

  theory that an increased N(E_{F}) leads to higher T_{c}'s still holds for all alkali-metal intercalated C60 superconducting materials, including Na2RbC60, which was wrongly thought to be an "anomalous" compound. We believe that this result will act as an important ingredient in all models of superconductivity in C60-based materials. Second, it has been shown unambiguously that the relative orientation of C60 molecules in the solid does affect sensitively the details of the electronic structure, as revealed by the existence of the second "universal" line. This requires explicit consideration of an additional "new parameter," namely molecular orientation. Simply speaking, we may view the C60 molecule not just like a "large atom," but like a large atom with "spin." Then, the C60-based solids should lead to a variety of physical properties, just by tuning the "spin" orientation.

###### Abstract

The pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} of simple-cubic Na2CsC60 is studied by an ac susceptibility method with a Swenson-type piston-cylinder apparatus. The observed value of _dT__c_/_dP_ is -12.5+-0.2 K/GPa, significantly larger than the values of -7.8 and -9.7 K/GPa reported earlier for K3C60 and Rb3C60, respectively. Using the compressibility available (that of K3C60), we find that the evolution of T_{c} with interfullerene spacing in Na2CsC60 is significantly different from that established for merohedrally disordered face-centered-cubic superconductors M3C60 (_M_ = alkali metal), but in excellent agreement with the ambient pressure data for the simple cubic superconductors Na2RbC60 and Na2CsC60. The present results provide an additional dimension to the existing features of fulleride superconductors, establishing the importance of the relative orientation of C603- ions in affecting the electronic and conducting properties of these materials.

Since the discovery of relatively high-temperature superconductivity in alkali-metal-doped M3C60 compounds,1-3 a large amount of experimental and theoretical work4 has been devoted to the understanding of the properties of these novel molecular solids. At present, the highest reported superconducting transition temperature T_{c} stands at 33 K, observed in the RbCs2C60 compound.5 Such a high T_{c} is only surpassed by the cuprate superconductors. What is most striking for the superconductivity in these systems is the existence of a simple monotonic relation between T_{c} and the unit cell size (or intermolecular spacing), observed both at ambient pressure for a number of mixed metal M3-_M tant to understand such an anomalous feature for elucidating the superconductivity in C60-based superconductors.

These considerations motivated the present work in which we address the relation between T_{c} and lattice constant for simple-cubic fullerides by measuring the evolution with pressure of the superconducting properties of Na2CsC60.

In this paper we will explain the apparent paradox of the anomalous T_{c} for the Rb and normal T_{c} of the Cs isostructural samples, that is, there exist _two_ universal curves, describing the dependence of T_{c} on the interfullerene spacing: one for fcc and another much steeper for simple cubic fullerides, with the differences arising through the changed orientational state of the fulleride ions.

The Na2CsC60 sample was prepared by reaction of stoichiometric quantities of C60, Na, and Cs, contained in a tantalum cell inside a sealed glass tube filled with He to 600 Torr, at 200 degC for 12 h and at 430 degC for three weeks with intermittent shaking. Phase purity was confirmed by x-ray-diffraction measurements. The sample was superconducting with a T_{c} of 12 K and a superconducting volume fraction of more than 59% measured with a superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometer. A Rb3C60 superconductor with a T_{c} of 29.5 K was also prepared as a reference sample for comparisons with published high-pressure data. For the pressure work, the technique using a Swenson-type piston-cylinder apparatus was employed. The T_{c} under pressure was determined with an ac susceptibility method using the primary and secondary coils wound around the sample. The frequency of the magnetic field was 923 Hz. The data were collected as output signal of a lock-in amplifier. Nearly hydrostatic pressure was retained in a Teflon cell filled with a fluid pressure transmitting medium (mixture of Fluorinert FC70 and FC77). The force applied to the high-pressure apparatus was controlled not to change during the measurements on cooling and heating, that is, these measurements were performed always at constant pressure. The reproducibility of the present ac susceptibility data was checked by repeating the measurements at each pressure three times.

Figure 1 shows the ac magnetic susceptibility, \chi, of the present Na2CsC60 sample as a function of temperature in a pressure range from 0.2 to 0.6 GPa. No transition to a superconducting state was observed at 0.8 GPa down to 2 K. The pressure dependence of T_{c} is presented in Fig. 2. The error bars in the temperature in Figs. 2 and 3 represent the scatter of the data for triply-performed measurements. As it can be seen, T_{c} varies linearly up to 0.6 GPa with a slope of dT_{c}/dP\!=\!-12.5\!\pm\!0.2 K/GPa. This value is considerably larger than the values of -7.8 and -9.7 K/GPa,7 reported for K3C60 and Rb3C60, respectively. Figure 2 shows unequivocally the larger dT_{c}/dP in Na2CsC60 than the counterpart on the fcc fullerides. At present, the compressibility of Na2CsC60 is not known, and thus we cannot derive the relation between the T_{c} and the lattice constant at the various applied pressures directly from the present experimental re

However, to a first approximation, we can obtain an estimate of the lattice constant of Na_{2}CsC_{60} at elevated pressures by using the linear compressibility value, -d\ln a/P (a= lattice constant), of 1.2 x 10^{-2} GPa^{-1}, measured for K_{3}C_{60}.[8] In this way, the lattice constants at each pressure can be derived. In Fig. 3, the T_{c} is observed at each pressure are plotted against the lattice constant values, together with the present high-pressure results on Rb_{3}C_{60} and earlier values on various superconducting M_{3}C_{60} (or M_{3-x}M_{x}^{\prime}C_{60}) fullerides.[8, 10] It is clearly seen that the relation between T_{c} and the lattice constant in Na_{2}CsC_{60} is markedly different from the one established in merohedral fcc fullerides. Yet it coincides exactly with the line obtained at ambient pressure for simple-cubic Na_{2}CsC_{60} and Na_{2}RbC_{60} (shown by a solid line in Fig. 3).

We believe that this agreement is not fortuitous, although the exact value of the Na_{2}CsC_{60} compressibility is currently unknown. We do not expect it to be substantially different from the value assumed in the present study, as can be inferred from several high-pressure studies of fullerene solids.[15]^{-}[18] High-pressure work on pristine C_{60} established[17] that the compressibility of -d\ln V/dP = 5.5 x 10^{-2} GPa^{-1} reported earlier[15, 16] was for the simple cubic phase of the materials. Moreover, Samara _et al._[17] concluded that the compressibility of the fcc and sc were not too different. More detailed measurements[19] later established that the compressibility of the fcc is roughly 30% larger than that of the sc phase. As a result, we can conclude that the compressibility of the fullerene solids is only weakly dependent on the orientation of the C_{60} molecules in the solid. Thus, we can conclude that our approximation that the compressibility of Na_{2}CsC_{60} is of the same order of magnitude as that of K_{3}C_{60} is reasonable. As fcc phases appear to be somewhat softer than sc ones,[19] agreement of the present high-pressure data with the ambient pressure ones could be even better. Thus the transition temperatures of the fcc fullerides and the sc fullerides follow their own relations different to each other but common in the fullerides having the same structures.

Originally Na_{2}RbC_{60} was assumed to be an "anomalous" fullerene superconductor, and much effort was spent in an attempt to understand its behavior, which was thought to provide an important clue for the mechanism of superconductivity in these systems. The question arises about whether or not the density of state at the Fermi surface is an important controlling factor for T_{c}. Our present experiments clearly establish the existence of simple "universal" relation between T_{c} and interfullerene spacings for _all_ alkali-metal intercalated C_{60} superconductors; the different structural families characterized by the different orientational states of the C_{60}^{3-} ions only give rise to different dT_{c}/da (a= lattice constant) gradients. Thus the unexpectedly low T_{c} of Na_{2}RbC_{60} should result from the much steeper dependence of N(E_{F}) (and/or electron-phonon coupling V) on the intermolecular separation in sc than in fcc fullerides.
