###### Abstract

Pressure-induced superconductivity and its relation to the corresponding
Hall coefficient (R_(H)) have been investigated for Bi₂Te₃, a known
topological insulator, through _in situ_ measurements of
magnetoresistance and ac susceptibility with diamond anvil cells. A full
phase diagram is presented which shows a complex dependence of the
superconducting transition temperature as a function of pressure over an
extensive range. High-pressure R_(H) measurements reveal a close
relation to these complex behaviors; in particular, an abrupt change of
d R_(H)/dP is observed in crossing from the nonsuperconducting to the
superconducting ambient-pressure phase.

The topological insulators represent an unusual state of quantum matter,
the bulk state of which is characterized by a full insulating gap while
the edge state or surface state is gapless.[1] This state has attracted
much attention because of its potential applications in topological
quantum computing.[2] Recent theoretical predictions[3, 4] and
experimental observations[5, 6, 7, 8] have successfully discovered a
number of topological insulator systems.[9] It has been proposed that
electronic excitations like Majorana states may be realized when
topological insulators are combined with magnetic or superconducting
materials.[10, 11] In particular, topological superconductors analogous
to topological insulators have been proposed, which have a fully gapped
pairing state in the bulk but with a gapless surface state consisting of
Majorana fermions.[12] It has been reported that Cu intercalation in
Bi₂Se₃ gave rise to superconductivity with T_(c) = 3.8 K although
whether a topological superconducting state was realized remains to be
established.[13] There has been a great impetus to induce
superconductivity in topological insulators or to search for clear
topological superconductors.

In this study, we report an investigation of pressure-induced
superconductivity over an extensive pressure range and its relation to
the Hall coefficient (R_(H)) in bismuth telluride (Bi₂Te₃), which is a
prototypical topological insulator in its rhombohedral phase at ambient
pressure (AP), through _in situ_ measurements of magnetoresistance and
ac susceptibility in diamond anvil cells. We find that the
pressure-induced superconductivity exhibits nonmonotonic behaviors with
pressure, i.e., a distinct pressure dependence is observed in different
phases [AP phase (<8 GPa), high-pressure phase I (8-14 GPa), and
high-pressure phase II (>14 GPa) denoted as HP I and HP II phases,
respectively, hereafter] induced by high pressure. In particular, even
at low pressure where the crystal structure remains the same as at
ambient pressure (AP phase), a nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the
superconducting transition temperature (T_(c)) is observed. Furthermore,
ac susceptibility data obtained at 5.8 GPa demonstrate that the
pressure-induced superconductivity in Bi₂Te₃ has bulk nature.
High-pressure Hall coefficient measurements reveal an interesting
correlation with the pressure-induced nonsuperconducting to
superconducting transition in the AP phase, which indicates that the
superconducting transition is related to a clear electronic structure
change. From the AP to the HP phase, R_(H) changes sign from positive to
negative, giving clear evidence for a crossover in the electron
structure. In the HP phases, T_(c) also displays nonmonotonic behaviors
with pressure.

Single crystals of Bi₂Te₃ were grown by the self-flux method. Bismuth
and tellurium powders were weighed according to the stoichiometric
Bi₂Te₃ composition. After mixing thoroughly, the powder was placed in
alumina crucibles and sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum. The
materials were heated to 1000 degC, held for 12 h to obtain a high
degree of mixing, and then slowly cooled down to 500 degC over 100 h
before cooling to room temperature. Bi₂Te₃ single crystals of several
millimeters in size were obtained. The quality of the resulting crystals
was confirmed by use of a single-crystal x-ray diffraction instrument
(SMART, APEXII) at room temperature.

High-pressure electrical resistance measurements were performed using
the standard four-probe technique in a monmagnetic diamond anvil cell
(DAC) made of BeCu alloy. The Bi₂Te₃ single crystal assembled with
platinum wires was loaded into the DAC. Nonmagnetic rhenium metal was
employed as the gasket, which was insulated with a fine powder of cubic
boron nitride. The pressure-induced superconducting transition in the
Bi₂Te₃ single crystal was confirmed using two compensating primary and
secondary coil systems. The excitation field for the ac susceptibility
studies is 4 Oe at 478 Hz. The Be-Cu gasket was used for ac
susceptibility measurements. By means of the van der Pauw technique, the
high-pressure Hall resistivity was measured by sweeping the magnetic
field at a fixed temperature for each pressure point. The pressure media
used for the resistance and ac susceptibility measurements are NaCl
powder and glycerin, respectively. The DAC was set in a closed-cycle
refrigerator equipped with a superconducting magnet. Pressure was
determined by ruby fluorescence.[14]

Figure 1 shows the resistance-temperature dependence of Bi₂Te₃ at
different pressures over an extensive range. No superconducting
transition is detected down to 1.5 K when the applied pressure is below
3 GPa [Fig. 1(a)]. As the pressure approaches 3.2 GPa, a clear resistive
drop appears with an onset temperature at 2.6 K. The resistive drop gets
more pronounced with increasing pressure, and zero resistance

is fully realized at 4.8 GPa. This zero resistance persists all the way
to 22.3 GPa which is the highest pressure we applied in the present
studies (Fig. 1). The pressure-induced superconductivity exhibits clear
nonmonotonic behaviors over the pressure range investigated. In the
pressure range between 3.2 and 4.8 GPa [Fig. 1(a)], the onset
temperature of the resistive drop increases with increasing pressure.
However, in the pressure range of 4.8-7.5 GPa [Fig. 1(b)], the onset
temperature decreases with increasing pressure. This trend is reversed
again in the pressure range of 9.1-22.3 GPa where the onset temperature
of the resistive drop goes up [Fig. 1(c)] and then goes down with
increasing pressure [Fig. 1(d)].

To characterize whether the resistive drop is related to a
superconducting transition, we applied magnetic fields on the compressed
Bi₂Te₃. As shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), the resistive drops, in
different phases, at 3.5 and 9.5 K for 4.8 and 13.6 GPa shift toward
lower temperature, and finally the zero resistance is lost at higher
magnetic field, indicating that the resistive drops are truly caused by
a superconducting transition. The pressure-induced superconducting
transition is also detected using a side-by-side coil system in a DAC,
as displayed in the inset of Fig. 2(c). In the ac susceptibility
measurements, none is observed above 1.5 K at pressures below 1.5 GPa.
However, at 5.8 GPa a superconducting transition does appear with T_(c)
about 3.3 K, as seen in Fig. 2(c). By a comparison with MgB₂ (100%)
measured in the same refrigerator, the superconducting volume fraction
of Bi₂Te₃ at 5.8 GPa is estimated to be about ∼50% from the magnitude of
its superconducting transition (170 nV). This result indicates that the
pressure-induced superconductivity of Bi₂Te₃ in its AP phase has bulk
properties, eliminating the concern that superconductivity occurs only
at the dislocations caused by pressure. The superconducting transition
temperature T_(c) (onset T_(c)) as a function of applied field is
displayed in Fig. 2(d).

drop of Bi₂Te₃ under different magnetic fields of (a) 4.8 and (b) 13.6
GPa. The real part of the ac susceptibility of the sample at 5.8 GPa is
shown in (c). The T_(c) dependence of the magnetic field is displayed in
(d).

We have repeated high-pressure measurements on Bi₂Te₃ for seven
independent runs using different samples and the results are highly
reproducible. In order to demonstrate the results more clearly, we
present the experimental data for the pressure dependence of the onset
T_(c) derived from only three runs of these measurements in Fig. 3(a).
It is known that there are phase transitions occurring at around 8 GPa
between the AP and HP I phases and 14 GPa between the HP I and HP II
phases.[15] The distinct pressure dependence of T_(c) is clearly related
to these three phases because the change of crystal structure influences
the symmetry of the Fermi surface, which is tightly related to the
superconductivity.

It is interesting to note that a superconducting transition temperature
up to 9.5 K is realized at 13.6 GPa near the boundary between the HP I
and HP II phases [Fig. 3(a)]. High-pressure studies of possible
superconductivity in Bi₂Te₃ have been reported by several groups;[16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21] however, no diamagnetization experiments or complete
superconducting phase diagram with different phases of crystal structure
over such a large pressure range have reported to our knowledge.

To understand the complex pressure dependence of T_(c) [T_(c)(P)] in
Bi₂Te₃, particularly the emergence of superconductivity and the
nonmonotonic T_(c)(P) in the AP phase, we performed Hall coefficient
measurements on Bi₂Te₃ at high pressure, with a magnetic field
perpendicular to the ab plane of the sample up to 5 T, by sweeping the
magnetic field at a fixed temperature for each given pressure. Figure
3(b) shows the pressure dependence of the Hall coefficient
R_(H) = ρ_(xy)/μ₀H (B = μ₀H) at 30 K. To discuss detailed features in
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) more clearly, we divide the diagram of the
superconducting phase and the pressure dependence of the Hall
coefficient into four regions. Particularly interesting regions in the
phase diagram of Fig. 3(a) are regions I and II. First, these are the
regions in which the crystal structure remains the same as in the AP
phase where the topological insulator is well established. Second, at
3.2 GPa, there is a pressure-induced superconducting transition. Third,
even after the sample becomes a superconductor above 3.2 GPa, the
superconducting temperature exhibits nonmonotonic variation with
pressure, showing a maximum of 3.5 K at 4.8 GPa where dT_(c)/dP changes
sign. The Hall coefficients in these two regions show quite different
behaviors. The initial value of R_(H) at ambient pressure is positive,
indicating that hole carriers are dominant in Bi₂Te₃. R_(H) decreases
rapidly with increasing pressure at the rate d R_(H)/dP = −2.61 × 10⁻⁷
m³/C GPa in region I where the sample is not superconducting; for
pressures above 1.5 GPa in region II, where superconductivity is
induced, R_(H) decreases at a much lower rate d R_(H)/dP = −0.33 × 10⁻⁷
m³/C GPa. The abrupt slope change in R_(H) in the AP phase is closely
related to a pronounced change of band structure. However, no anomaly is
observed in the R_(H)-P curve in region II where the sample is
superconducting and T_(c)(P) shows a bell shape under pressure [Fig.
3(a)], the origin of which needs further investigation. As the pressure
increases further in region III, T_(c) increases again at the rate
dT_(c)/dP = +1.37 K/GPa after the structural phase transition as
indicated in Fig. 3(a), indicating that the HP phase favors higher
T_(c). The maximum value of T_(c) in Bi₂Te₃ reaches nearly 9.5 K at 13.6
GPa. However, R_(H) changes from positive to negative sign at a pressure
between regions II and III, suggesting that pressure induces a crossover
of the electron structure in Bi₂Te₃, probably turning the sample into an
electron-dominated conventional superconductor. T_(c) passes through a
maximum and then decreases in region IV after the second phase
transition. Since Bi₂Te₃ is an exotic material in the sense of
topological insulators, its superconducting mechanism, particularly the
dramatic pressure-induced change of d R_(H)/dP in the AP phase and the
crossover of R_(H) from the AP to the HP phase, deserves further
experimental and theoretical efforts.

In summary, we have provided a complete phase diagram to show the
complex dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on
pressure and its relation to the Hall coefficient over an extensive
pressure range in Bi₂Te₃, a typical topological insulator at ambient
pressure. Distinct behaviors are observed in different phases in the
pressure range investigated. We found that the initial value of R_(H)
decreases rapidly with increasing pressure up to 1.5 GPa in region I,
where the sample is not superconducting; afterward it decreases very
slowly as pressure increases further in region II, where
superconductivity is discovered from _in situ_ resistance and ac
susceptibility measurements under high pressure. These results suggested
that the dramatic change in d R_(H)/dP reflects a pronounced change in
band structure. In region II, T_(c)(P) exhibited rising and falling
behavior,

while R_(H) changed linearly. With increasing pressure, the AP phase
transforms to the HP phase in region III and the T_(c) rises again. The
corresponding Hall coefficient changes from positive to negative after
the transition, demonstrating that pressure induces a crossover of the
electron state from the hole-dominated to electron-dominated type in
Bi₂Te₃. In addition, we found that the value of T_(c) in the Bi₂Te₃
superconductor with electron carriers is higher than that with hole
carriers. We believe that our present work may stimulate further
experimental and theoretical investigations to understand the origin of
these observations and to clarify whether a topological superconductor
could be realized in Bi₂Te₃ at high pressure.
