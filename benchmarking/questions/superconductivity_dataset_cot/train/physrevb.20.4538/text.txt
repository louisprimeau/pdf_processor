###### Abstract

The effects of pressure on both the structure and superconducting transition temperatures (_T_c) of several Nb-based compounds are examined. Comparisons are made between the Ti3P-structure type, in which Nb3As and Nb3Si normally crystallize, and the _A_-15 structure in which Nb3Ge and many other high-_T_c materials form. A comparison is also made between stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric forms of the _A_-15 structure. The compressibilities are measured under hydrostatic pressures to about 6 GPa; the pressure dependencies of _T_c are measured to about 10 GPa for the As and Si compounds and to about 1 GPa for the Ge compounds. The structural and electrical measurements are combined and the volume dependencies of _T_c are reported and compared. Considerations are given to the possibility of a pressure-induced transition from the Ti3P type to the _A_-15 structure for the As and Si compounds.

## 1 Introduction

Interest in the intermetallic \(A\)3_B_ compounds crystallizing in the _A_-15 structure has persisted for many years; several excellent review articles have appeared in the literature.1-5 The extensive activity in this area was initiated largely by the discovery of high superconducting-transition temperatures in V3Si (_T_c = 17 K) by Hardy and Hulm [6] and in Nb3Sn (_T_c = 18 K) by Matthias, Geballe, Geller, and Corenzwit.7 (The current accepted maximum value of _T_c is 23.2 K for sputtered _A_-15 films of Nb3Ge as reported by Testardi, Wernick, and Royer.8) Some of these compounds have relatively high-critical fields and currents, thereby further enhancing their potential utilitarian significance.

More recently, some attention has been focused on the stoichiometric compounds Nb3As and Nb3Si. Normally these compounds form in the tetragonal Ti3P-type crystal structure as reported by Waterstrat _et al._, [6] and hereafter referred to simply as "Ti3P structures." However, based on empirical arguments, it has been predicted that if these compounds were to form in the _A_-15, rather than the Ti3P structure, they would then exhibit values of _T_c in excess of 25 K. [5, 11-13]

Details of the electronic and superconducting properties of these compounds have recently been discussed in some detail by Gubser, Hein, Waterstrat, and Junod.14 It is the objective of this paper to consider possible interconnections between the electronic and structural properties which might be useful in predicting favorable conditions for formation of the _A_-15 structure. Specifically, the hydrostatic compressibilities of the Ti3P structures, Nb3As and Nb3Si, are measured and compared with the _A_-15 compounds, Nb0,82Ge0.18 and the stoichiometric compound Nb3Ge. This information is then correlated with the pressure dependence of _T_c as measured from the same samples.

## 2 Experimental procedures and results

### Compressibility measurements

The Nb3As and Nb3Si samples used in this work were prepared at the Universite de Geneve from the constituent elementary components.9 Details of the preparation of the Ti3P-type structures are discussed elsewhere.14 The stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric (Nb0,82Ge0.18) Ge samples were prepared by chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) techniques described elsewhere15 and by standard arc-melting methods, respectively.

The compressibility measurements were carried out  by means of high-pressure x-ray diffraction techniques. The Nb3As, Nb3Si, and Nb0.82Ge0.18 samples were first mechanically ground and passed through a 400-mesh sieve and then thoroughly mixed with similarly prepared NaCl powder. Only limited quantities of the Nb3Ge were available; these were used in the "as received" polycrystalline conditions. The polycrystalline mixtures were loaded in a diamond-anvil pressure cell and immersed in a hydraulic fluid (4 : 1 of methanol: ethanol by volume containing less than 10% glycerine) contained in a hardened metal gasket. A 4 : methanol: ethanol mixture has a freezing pressure in excess of 10 GPa at room temperature,16 thereby ensuring hydrostatic pressures for the compressibility data reported here. The pressure cavity was irradiated with Zr-filtered radiation from a Mo x-ray tube operated at 48 kV and 14 mA; the diffracted radiation was recorded photographically. Additional details of the high-pressure x-ray experimental techniques are discussed elsewhere.17,18

The linear compressibilities of the Ti3P structures were determined from the pressure shift of the (201), (321), (112,330), (420), (411), and (222) diffraction lines. [The (112) and (330) lines could not be resolved on the high-pressure photographs.] A least-squares routine was used to find the axial lengths of the tetragonal unit cell at each pressure, _a_(_P_) and _c_(_P_). For the cubic Nb3Ge and Nb0.82Ge0.18 samples, the (200), (210), (211), (220), and (310) lines were used to determine _a_(_P_). The pressure was computed from the measured shift in the NaCl (111), (200), and (220) diffraction lines with the aid of the equation of state calculations of Decker.19

Compressibility data are presented graphically in Figs. 1 and 2. The uncertainties in the specific values of _a_(_P_) and _c_(_P_) reflect the quality of the aforementioned least-squares fits to the measured \(d\) spacings at each pressure; the overall experimental error can be estimated from the scatter in the data. In all cases, the measured fractional changes in the lattice parameters with pressure are represented by a linear function: the equations of these first-order curves were determined by a least-squares fit to the \(\Delta a\left( {P} \right)/a_{0}\) and \(\Delta c\left( {P} \right)/c_{0}\) values. Estimated values for the linear (_k_a and _k_c) and volume (_K_) compressibilities, based on these linear fits, are given in Table I.

It is noted that the compressibilities of all of the compounds are equivalent within their combined experimental uncertainties. Moreover, there is essentially no anisotropy in the linear compressibilities of the Ti3P structures; thus one would expect the effect of hydrostatic pressure on these tetragonal structures to produce a uniform distortion of the lattice. Blaugher, Taylor, and Ashkin20 have carried out compressibility studies on the _A_-15 structure of stoichiometric V3Si. At 5 GPa they report a fraction-al change in the lattice parameter of about \(- 10.5 \times 10^{- 3}\). This is only slightly larger than the value of \(- 7 \times 10^{- 3}\) observed here for both of the _A_-15 structures.

### Superconductivity studies

The effect of pressure on the superconducting-transition temperature, \(T_{\rm c}(P)\), of the Ti\({}_{3}\)P structures was measured with a variable pressure, low-temperature diamond-anvil cell which was coupled to a dilution refrigerator.[21, 22] In order to improve hydrostatic conditions on the brittle Ti\({}_{3}\)P-structure superconductors, the samples were first powdered as discussed above, and then mixed with Cu powder of similar size to produce a more uniform distribution of pressure in the sample cavity. Nonhydrostatic strains of unknown magnitude were undoubtedly present. In _A_-15 compounds, strains tend to decrease \(T_{\rm c}\). Our measurements on the Ti\({}_{3}\)P-compound, Nb\({}_{3}\)As, show an increasing \(T_{\rm c}\); hence, we conclude that strain effects are not as important for these compounds as in the _A_-15 materials.

Pressure on the sample itself was estimated from the pressure acting on the bellows, which transmitted force to the diamonds, using a previously determined calibration.[21, 22] An ac mutual-inductance technique was used to measure the superconducting transition and the temperature was determined from a calibrated carbon resistance thermometer.

Figure 3 shows the data, corrected to eliminate background signal, for the Nb\({}_{3}\)Si and Nb\({}_{3}\)As superconducting transitions. The in-phase or inductive output of the mutual inductance bridge is plotted (vertical axis) versus temperature for various pressure settings. These two compounds have previously been reported superconducting at temperatures near 0.3 K.[14] Data shown here indicate transition temperatures near 0.25 K. Two obvious differences between Nb\({}_{3}\)Si and Nb\({}_{3}\)As are apparent. First, the width of the Nb\({}_{3}\)As transition is greater than that of Nb\({}_{3}\)Si which may indicate a greater compositional variation within the Nb\({}_{3}\)As sample or a higher concentration of defects introduced during formation of the compound. Secondly, whereas the transition temperature of Nb\({}_{3}\)Si did not change within experimental error, Nb\({}_{3}\)As showed a positive increase with pressure. (The diminution of signal with pressure for the Nb\({}_{3}\)Si sample can be explained by a rearrangement of the individual Nb\({}_{3}\)Si particles as pressure was increased.)

Measurements of \(T_{\rm c}(P)\) for the Nb-Ge samples were made with ac mutual-inductance techniques with lock-in amplifiers to measure the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the magnetic susceptibility. The samples were clamped in a Be-Cu pressure bomb of the Chester type at room temperature. The samples were mixed with a pressure calibrant and immersed in a 1:1 mixture of pentane and isoamyl al

 cohol; thus a hydrostatic pressure was "frozen-in" as the bomb was cooled. The pressure calibrants were Pb and Sn for the Nb3Ge and Nb0.82Ge0.18 runs, respectively. The width of the superconducting transitions were 0.3 to 0.4 K for Nb3Ge, but only 0.1 K for the nonstoichiometric sample; the values of _T_c(_P_) were taken to be the midpoints of the transition curves. These data are plotted for the Nb-Ge samples in Figs. 4 and 5. For the Nb-Ge compounds, linear least-squares fits were made to the data shown in the figures. The results of these estimates and curve fits are tabulated in Table 1. The _dT__e/dP_ result shown for Nb0.82Ge0.18, viz., -(116 +- 5) K/TPa, compares very favorably with the value of -114 K/TPa reported by Smith23 for essentially the same sample composition.

## III Discussion

It has been known for some time that crystallization of an \(A\)3_B_ compound in the _A_-15 structure is apparently favored when the ratio of the atomic radii, _R_(_A_)/_R_(_B_), is roughly within 10% of unity, here _R_(_A_), _R_(_B_) is the radius of the \(A\), \(B\) atom.24 (Although Johnson and Douglas25 have noted that there are a significant number of exceptions to this empirical guideline.) The ratio of atomic radii of Nb to either Si or As may, however, approach or exceed 10% of unity26 and the compounds Nb3Si and Nb3As do not normally exist in the cubic _A_-15 crystal structure but, as noted above, in the tetragonal Ti3P structure. Considering for the moment only Nb3Si, it was noted by Leger and Hall27 that, since the initial- or low-pressure volume compressibility of Si was greater than Nb, then the _R_(Nb)/_R_(Si) ratio should increase with pressure making a pressure-induced phase change to the _A_-15 structure unlikely. However, in another article, Hall26 noted that the atomic radius ratio at 10 GPa had actually decreased 3%, suggesting that pressures may in fact be beneficial in creating conditions favorable for a change to the _A_-15 structure. The entire concept of using atomic radii and elemental compressibilities to predict structural changes in complex compounds at high pressures is certainly questionable. The use of _A_-15 Geller radii25,28 may be more justified for structure predictions in these compounds but no data on the pressure dependence of these radii exist.

Since, for Nb3As and Nb3Si at ambient pressure the Ti3P structure is stable as compared to the _A_-15 structure, it may be supposed that the stable and metastable (denoted by an asterisk) forms have Gibbs free energies which differ by \(G_{{\text{B}}}^{2}{\text{g}}_{{\text{B}}}\left( {\text{Ti}}_{{\text{3}}}{\text{P}} \right) - G_{{\text{B}}}^{2}{\text{g}}_{{\text{B}}}\left( {A - 15^{\ast}} \right)\) at \(P\) = 0, \(T\) = 298K. The _A_-15 structure will be favored at high pressure if the density of the _A_-15 structure is higher than that of the Ti3P structure [(0_G_/_th_)_r_ = _V_] and if the compressibility of the hypothetical _A_-15 structure is sufficiently low that the inequality of the volumes is retained [_K_(Ti3P) ~ _K_(_A_-15_deg_)] or even enhanced [_K_(Ti3P) < _K_(_A_-15_deg_)] at elevated pressures.

The compressibility data reported here support the idea that a pressure-induced structural instability may be produced in these Ti3P compounds at elevated pressures. Based on the structural information of Waterstra _et al._,4 the computed densities of Nb3Si and Nb3As (Ti3P structure) are 7.517 g cm-3 and 8.530 g cm-3, respectively. However, based on the Geller relation28 whereby the _A_-15 unit-cell dimensions can be determined from the _A_-_B_ contact distance, the predicted unit-cell parameters of the corresponding _A_-15 structures are 5.08 and 5.12 A, respectively, which yield _A_-15 densities of 7.78 and 8.75 g cm-3, respectively. Thus in each case, the density of the Ti3P structure is about 3% less than that

 predicted for the density of the _A_-15 structure. Since the compressibilities of the two structures appear comparable, it can be concluded that at elevated pressure, the _A_-15 structure will eventually become more stable than the Ti\({}_{\rm P}\) and, further, that the decrease in the free energy arising from the volume reduction of the phase transformation will become increasingly greater with increasing pressure. However, it is also possible that other structures may be preferred at high pressures, so that the _A_-15 may not be stable at any pressure.

Pressure induced changes in the superconducting transition \(T_{e}\) of Nb3Si, Nb3As, Nb3Ge, and Nb0.82Ge0.18 give further plausible evidence suggesting pressure stabilization of the _A_-15 phase. Pressure effects on the electron-phonon coupling parameter \(l\) can be estimated from the approximate relation29

\[\frac{\partial\ln\lambda}{\partial\ln V}\approx\frac{\partial\ln T_{e}}{ \partial\ln V}/\left[\ln\left(\frac{\Theta}{T_{e}}\right)f(\lambda,\mu^{*}) \right]\,.\]

where

\[\frac{\partial\ln T_{e}}{\partial\ln V}=\frac{1}{KT_{e}}\,\frac{\partial T_{e}}{\partial P}\]

and, according to the McMillan strong coupling \(T_{e}\) formulation,

\[\Theta=\langle\omega\rangle/1.2\]

and

\[f(\lambda,\mu^{*})=\frac{\lambda(1+0.38)}{(1+\lambda)(\lambda-\mu^{*}-0.62 \lambda\mu^{*})}\,.\]

Here \(o\) is a phonon frequency and \(m\) is the Coulomb repulsion term.

The quantity (\(\partial\ln\lambda/\partial\ln V\)) is related to changes in electronic and phonon properties through the relation

\[\frac{\partial\ln\lambda}{\partial\ln V}=\frac{\partial\ln\eta}{\partial\ln V}+\frac{\partial\ln(\langle\omega^{-2}\rangle)}{\partial\ln V}\,\,,\]

where \(e\) is the product of the density of electronic states at the Fermi level _N_(\(E_{F}\)) and the average electron phonon matrix element \(\langle I^{2}\rangle\)

\[\eta=N(E_{F})\,\langle I^{2}\rangle\,\,.\]

According to recent band-structure calculations,30 the quantity \(e\) is not expected to be particularly sensitive to volume changes for the _A_-15 Nb-Ge compounds since the Fermi levels fall in a broad minimum of the density-of-states curve. The volume dependence is thus expected to arise mainly from the (1/_o_2) term. As the volume decreases, one generally expects (1/_o_2) to decrease as the lattice begins to stiffen; hence, one anticipates the positive volume derivatives as observed. The large (factor of 2) difference in \(\partial\ln\lambda/\partial\ln V\) between the high-_T__e_, stoichiometric compound and the low-_T__e_ non-stoichiometric compound, suggests that the phonons are more sensitive to pressure in the high-_T__e_ superconductor. This fact, in turn, suggests that the stoichiometric compound, which is a metastable phase, may be closer to a pressure-stabilized structural instability than the nonstoichiometric compound, i.e., it suggests that the stable high-pressure phase of stoichiometric Nb3Ge is the _A_-15 structure. Evidence of a pressure-induced shift in the equilibrium _A_-15 phase boundary toward stoichiometric compositions has in fact been observed by Webb, Francavilla, Meussner, and Waterstrat.31

Preliminary experiments to produce the _A_-15 structure were carried out on Nb3As and Nb3Si at static pressures up to 20 GPa. However, x-ray diffraction patterns obtained at this pressure could still be indexed on the basis of the Ti3P structure. It is possible, however, that kinetic factors prevented the transition from taking place.

At higher temperatures, e.g., close to the melting temperature, where kinetic factors are favorable, it is possible that the pressure needed to form the _A_-15 phase will be reduced. For this to occur the entropy of the _A_-15 phase must be lower than the Ti3P phase. Using a Debye model for the specific heat, it is required that the Debye temperature be higher for the _A_-15 phase than for the Ti3P phase. Since the compressibilities are similar, the inequality will possibly hold because of the above relationship between the densities.

Although the foregoing remarks are in the nature of tentative speculations, they give some impetus to an experimental program of synthesis at high temperatures and pressures. It is noted that two successful efforts of transforming Nb3Si at elevated pressures have been reported: Pan, Alekseevskii, Popov, Beletskii, Yupko, and Yarosh32 reported forming Nb3Si in the _A_-15 structure through application of shock explosion techniques where estimated pressures in excess of 50 GPa were produced. Very recently, Dew-Hughes and Linse33 have confirmed the results of Pan _et al._ by transforming Nb3Si from the tetragonal structure to a high-_T__e_ superconductor (onset of 18 K) by explosive pressures approaching 100 GPa.
