Extreme anisotropy and anomalous transport properties of heavily electron doped Li\({}_{x}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{2}\) single crystals

Shanshan Sun (Sun  Then the eutectic flux of AlCl\({}_{3}\) and NaCl (=0.52:0.48) was mixed and loaded into the ampoules, which were subsequently evacuated down to 1 Pa and sealed. The ampoules were put into a horizontal furnace and heated with a temperature gradient (high-temperature region: 690 K; low-temperature region: 620 K) for 30 days. Finally, the furnace was shut down, and the ampoules cooled down naturally. The tetragonal crystals can be obtained after being dissolved in distilled water and rinsed in alcohol. The LiFeSe-122 single crystals were synthesized using the low-temperature ammonothermal technique. The FeSe single crystals and pieces of Li metal with a nominal mole ratio of 1:2 as well as a magnetic stirrer were loaded and sealed into a designed high-pressure vessel (25 mL) with a stop valve for evacuating treatment and another one for introducing NH\({}_{3}\). These manipulations were carried out in an argon-filled glove box in order to prevent air and water contamination. Then, the vessel was taken out of the glove box and evacuated down to 1 mPa by a turbo molecular pump. The NH\({}_{3}\) gas was introduced and condensed by cooling the vessel to 238 K for 20 min. After that, the vessel was taken out of the cooling bath and stirred for 2 d at room temperature in order to facilitate the reaction and to improve the homogeneity of intercalation. Crystals with a typical size 2 x 3 x 0.05 mm\({}^{3}\) can be obtained after evacuating the NH\({}_{3}\) gas. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Bruker D8 x-ray diffractometer with Cu \(K_{\alpha}\) radiation (\(\lambda\) = 0.15418 nm) at room temperature. The elemental analysis was performed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses. Electrical transport measurements were carried out in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS). The longitudinal and Hall electrical resistivities were measured using a four-probe method on rectangular-shaped single crystals. The current flows in the _ab_ plane of the crystal. The Hall resistivity was obtained from the difference in the transverse resistivity measured at the positive and negative fields in order to remove the longitudinal resistivity contribution due to the voltage probe misalignment, i.e., \(\rho_{xy}(\mu_{0}H)\) = [\(\rho(+\mu_{0}H)-\rho(-\mu_{0}H)\)]/2. The \(c\)-axis resistivity \(\rho_{c}(T)\) was measured by attaching current and voltage wires on opposite sides of the platelike crystal (see the Supplemental Material [23]). Magnetization measurements were performed in a Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS3).

## III Results

The crystal structure of LiFeSe-122 consists of FeSe and Li-NH\({}_{3}\) layers stacking along the \(c\) axis alternatively [inset (b) in Fig. 1(a)]. The space group is \(14/mmm\), and each unit cell contains two FeSe layers, the same as the paramagnetic K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) (\(T>T_{N}\)) [12]. The difference is that in K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) the K ions are located at the \(2a\) position, but this position is occupied by N atoms in LiFeSe-122, and Li ions are located in the \(2b\) and \(4c\) positions in the latter. In contrast, the space group of FeSe-11111 is \(P4/nmm\), and there is only one layer of FeSe in each unit cell [10]. Moreover, the Li-NH\({}_{3}\) layers in LiFeSe-122 are nonmagnetic, while the (Li, Fe)OH layers in FeSe-11111 are antiferromagnetic. The XRD pattern of a LiFeSe-122 single crystal [Fig. 1(a)] reveals that the crystal surface is parallel to the (00\(l\)) plane and the diffraction peaks shift to lower angles compared to the FeSe single crystal (see the Supplemental Material [23]). The thin platelike crystal with a square shape [inset (a) in Fig. 1(a)] is consistent with the layered structure of LiFeSe-122. The refined \(a\)- and \(c\)-axial lattice constants using the powder XRD pattern (see the Supplemental Material [23]) are 3.7704(6) and 16.973(7) A, respectively, consistent with previously reported values [18,20,22]. The \(a\)-axial lattice constant is close to that of the bulk FeSe (3.76 A) [11], suggesting that the intercalation of Li-NH\({}_{3}\) rarely changes the in-plane chemical environment of the FeSe layers [22]. In contrast, the distance \(d\) between two adjacent FeSe layers (\(\sim\)8.487 A, half of the \(c\)-axial lattice constant) is much larger than that of bulk FeSe (5.48 A) [11] but somewhat smaller than that of FeSe-11111 (9.16 A) [10]. This implies a rather weak interaction between the two adjacent FeSe layers, similar to FeSe-11111. Such weak inter-FeSe-layer bonding is also evidenced by the easy cleavage of crystals along the \(ab\)

  plane. The atomic ratio of Li:Fe:Se determined from the ICP-AES analysis is 0.18:1:0.9, and the measurement of EDX by examining multiple points on the crystals gives Fe:Se = 0.987:1 (see the Supplemental Material [23]). The slight difference in the Fe:Se ratio determined from ICP and EDX could be due to the different element sensitivities in the two techniques. Nonetheless, the close Fe:Se ratio clearly indicates the absence of Fe vacancies in LiFeSe-122 crystals. The chemical formula is then estimated to be Li\({}_{0.36}\)(NH\({}_{3}\))\({}_{y}\)Fe\({}_{2}\)Se\({}_{2}\), from which an electron doping level of \(\sim\)0.18 \(e\)/Fe is inferred.

Figure 1(b) shows the temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) and \(c\)-axis resistivity \(\rho_{c}(T)\) at zero field from 10 to 300 K. The in-plane resistivity \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) exhibits a metallic behavior in the entire measured temperature range, and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR), defined as \(\rho_{ab}(300\,\mathrm{K})/\rho_{ab}(50\,\mathrm{K})\), is about 11.2. Between 50 and 120 K, the \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) curve can be well fitted using the formula \(\rho_{ab}(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{a}\), with \(\rho_{0}=13.2(1)\,\mu\Omega\,\mathrm{cm}\), \(A=1.5(1)\times 10^{-3}\)\(\mu\Omega\,\mathrm{cm}\) K\({}^{-2}\), and \(\alpha=2.07(2)\). When further lowering the temperature, a sharp superconducting transition appears with \(T_{c,\mathrm{onset}}=44.56(4)\,\mathrm{K}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}=1.1\,\mathrm{K}\) at zero field [inset (a) in Fig. 1(b)]. \(T_{c}\) is significantly higher than that of bulk FeSe (\(\sim\)9 K; see the Supplemental Material [23]). For \(\rho_{c}(T)\), there is a hump in the curve with the peak position located around 170 K; that is, \(\rho_{c}(T)\) shows an insulating behavior for \(T>170\,\mathrm{K}\) and metallic behavior at \(T<170\,\mathrm{K}\). It has to be mentioned that the peak position varies from sample to sample between 120 and 170 K (see the Supplemental Material [23]). Between 50 and 100 K, the temperature dependence of \(\rho_{c}(T)\) is nearly linear, obviously different from that in \(\rho_{ab}(T)\). \(T_{c,\mathrm{onset}}\) for \(\rho_{c}(T)\) at zero field is 44.1(1) K with \(\Delta T_{c}=1.2\,\mathrm{K}\), consistent with that of \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) [inset (a) in Fig. 1(b)]. The sharp superconducting transitions for both current directions and rather large RRR in \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) indicate the high quality of the single crystal. On the other hand, the absolute value of \(\rho_{c}(T)\) is much larger than \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) in the normal state. The ratio of \(\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\) [inset (b) in Fig. 1(b)] is about 900 at 300 K and gradually increases to about 8000 when temperature is down to 50 K, indicating a significant anisotropy of LiFeSe-122 crystals. Notably, this anisotropy is even larger than that in FeSe-11111, although the former has a slightly smaller \(d\) value [24]. This suggests that the inter-FeSe-layer interaction might be even weaker in LiFeSe-122 than in FeSe-11111.

The zero-field-cooling (ZFC) dc magnetic susceptibility \(4\pi\,\chi(T)\) of a LiFeSe-122 single crystal at \(\mu_{0}H=1\,\mathrm{mT}\) for \(H\parallel c\) and \(H\parallel ab\) [Fig. 1(c)] shows that the superconducting shielding emerges at about 44.3(2) K with a rather sharp transition width, consistent with the resistivity results and previous magnetic susceptibility measurements (\(T_{c}\sim 44\,\mathrm{K}\)) [17, 18, 20, 22]. After taking into account the demagnetization effect of the crystal, the superconducting volume fractions (SVFs) estimated from the ZFC data are about 100% and 180% for \(H\parallel c\) and \(H\parallel ab\), respectively, indicating bulk superconductivity in the LiFeSe-122 single crystal. The larger SVF for \(H\parallel ab\) may come from the measurement error of the sample size. For field-cooling (FC) \(4\pi\,\chi(T)\) curves, the SVFs are about 20% and 10% for \(H\parallel c\) and \(H\parallel ab\) at 2 K, implying a rather strong flux pinning effect in the crystal, especially for \(H\parallel ab\).

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature dependence of \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) at various magnetic fields up to 14 T for \(H\parallel c\) and \(H\parallel ab\), respectively. With increasing fields, \(T_{c,\mathrm{onset}}\) shifts to lower temperatures only slightly for both field directions. However, the transition width becomes broader at higher fields. The trend is more obvious for \(H\parallel c\). Such a resistive tail for \(H\parallel c\) has also been observed in SmFeAsO\({}_{0.85}\) and cuprates [25, 26] and suggests the existence of a wide vortex-liquid phase for \(H\parallel c\). Interestingly, similar field-induced broadenings of resistive transitions have also been observed in FeSe-11111 [24]. The upper critical fields \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\) determined from 90%,

  50%, and 10% \(\rho_{n}\) in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) are summarized in Fig. 2(c). The \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\) curves for \(H\|ab\) exhibit larger slopes than those for \(H\|c\). Moreover, for \(H\|c\), \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\) determined from 10% \(\rho_{n}\) is much smaller than those from 50% and 90% \(\rho_{n}\) criteria because the region near 10% \(\rho_{n}\) is related to the vortex-liquid phase, while the region around 90% \(\rho_{n}\) is influenced by superconducting fluctuations. The slopes of \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)\) near \(T_{c,\rm{onset}}(0)\), \(T_{c,\rm{middle}}(0)\), and \(T_{c,\rm{zero}}(0)\) are \(-1.86\), \(-0.97\), and \(-0.16\,\rm{T/K}\) for \(H\|c\) and \(-16.19\), \(-6.83\), and \(-2.45\,\rm{T/K}\) for \(H\|ab\), respectively. According to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg formula [27], \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)=-0.693T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)\mid_{T_{c}}\), when choosing the 50% \(\rho_{n}\) criterion, the estimated \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}(0)\) is 29.5 and 208.7 T for \(H\|c\) and \(H\|ab\), respectively. The anisotropy of the upper critical field \(\gamma=\mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}/\mu_{0}H_{c2,c}\) is about 12 near \(T_{c,\rm{middle}}(0)\). It increases to about 18 at 42.6 K and then decreases gradually with decreasing temperature [inset of Fig. 2(c)].

In order to obtain a more accurate value of \(\gamma\), the angular-resolved in-plane resistivity \(\rho_{ab}(\theta,\mu_{0}H)\) under various fields at given temperatures has been measured (Fig. 3). All resistivity curves show a symmetric cuplike shape with a minimum value at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) and maximum values at \(\theta=0^{\circ}\) and \(180^{\circ}\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between the direction of the external field and the \(c\) axis. This indicates that \(\mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}\) is larger than \(\mu_{0}H_{c2,c}\). Moreover, the zero-resistivity region near \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) becomes narrower with increasing field and temperature. At high temperature (42 and 45 K), the zero-resistivity region disappears in the whole field range. According to the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory \(\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{GL}(\theta)=\mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}/(\sin^{2}\theta+\gamma^{2}\cos^{2} \theta)^{1/2}\)[28], \(\rho_{ab}(\theta,\mu_{0}H)\) at a certain temperature under different magnetic fields can be scaled into one curve with a proper anisotropy parameter \(\gamma=\mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}/\mu_{0}H_{c2,c}\). As shown in Fig. 4(a), by adjusting \(\gamma(T)\), we obtain very good scaling behaviors for LiFeSe-122 single crystals at various temperatures. The downward trend of \(\gamma(T)\) with decreasing temperature is shown in Fig. 4(b) clearly. The values of \(\gamma\) are much larger than those in bulk FeSe [29; 30], as well as in most other iron-based SCs [31; 32; 33]. However, they are comparable to those in FeSe-11111 [34]. According to the GL theory [28], \(\gamma\) is defined by \(\sqrt{m_{c}/m_{ab}}\), where \(m_{c}\) and \(m_{ab}\) are the effective masses of electrons along the \(c\) axis and \(ab\) plane, respectively. The enlarged \(d\) in LiFeSe-122 will decrease the interlayer interaction significantly, leading to a quite weak dispersion along the \(k_{z}\) direction [35]. Thus, \(m_{c}\) will become much larger than \(m_{ab}\), and this gives rise to a remarkably large \(\gamma\) in LiFeSe-122. This positive correlation between \(d\) and \(\gamma\) near \(T_{c}(0)\) has been observed in many iron-based SCs [36].

The transport properties in the normal state reflect the electronic scattering and can give us information about the Fermi surface (FS), which is important to understanding the superconductivity in iron-based SCs. The inset in Fig. 5(a) shows the magnetoresistance [MR = [\(\rho_{ab}(T,\mu_{0}H)-\rho_{ab}(T,0)\)]/\(\rho_{ab}(T,0)\)\(=\)\(\Delta\rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(T,0)\)] at various temperatures. The MR is relatively small (\(\sim\)6.5% at 50 K and 14 T) and decreases gradually with increasing temperature. Usually, if there is an isotropic relaxation time \(\tau\) at all points on the FS with a single type of carrier, Kohler's rule will be valid, and the MR at different temperatures can be scaled by the expression MR = \(f(\mu_{0}H\tau)=F(\mu_{0}H/\rho_{ab}T,0)\)[37]. However, Kohler's rule is clearly violated in the LiFeSe-122 single crystal [Fig. 5(a)]. In general, there are several possibilities leading to the invalidation of Kohler's rule, such as the multiband effect, anisotropic \(\tau\), two different relaxation times related to zero-field resistivity and MR, etc. [38]. In order to understand the origin of the violation of Kohler's rule, the temperature dependence of Hall resistivity \(\rho_{xy}\) is investigated. \(\rho_{xy}\) shows a

  good linear dependence on the magnetic field up to 14 T [inset of Fig. 5(b)], and the Hall coefficient \(R_{H}=\rho_{xx}/\mu_{0}H\) at 14 T is negative in the entire temperature range measured [Fig. 5(b)]. This indicates that the dominant carriers are electron type, consistent with the electron doping of Li into FeSe layers. Moreover, the magnitude of \(R_{H}\) reduces with increasing temperature. Strikingly, this temperature dependence and even the absolute value of \(R_{H}\) are quite similar to those in the gated-voltage-modulated FeSe flakes with \(T_{c}=48\) K [39], strongly suggesting a universal underlying physics in these HED FeSe-based SCs. In contrast, FeSe-1111 exhibits the concave shape of \(R_{H}\) with a characteristic temperature \(T^{*}\sim 120\) K, possibly related to the magnetic properties of (Li, Fe)OH layers that are absent in LiFeSe-122 [24].

The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results show that the hole pockets at the \(\Gamma\) point are absent in most HED FeSe-based SCs, such as (Tl, Rb)\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\), FeSe-11111, and m-FeSe/STO films [7]. A theoretical calculation for LiFeSe-122 also suggests that with electron doping, the size of the hole pockets remarkably shrinks, while the size of the electron pockets around the \(M\) point increases [35]. It is then most likely that the electron pockets in LiFeSe-122 play a dominant role in the transport properties in the normal state. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the apparent carrier concentration (i.e., the Hall number \(n_{H}=1/eR_{H}\)) is weakly temperature dependent below about 180 K, consistent with a single-band model with only electron pockets in LiFeSe-122. The estimated \(n_{H}\) at 50 K is about \(1.3\times 10^{21}\) cm\({}^{-3}\), much larger than that in FeSe [40] but comparable to \(3\times 10^{21}\) cm\({}^{-3}\), a value found by assuming 0.18 electron transferred from Li to each Fe atom. When \(T>180\) K, \(n_{H}\) increases quickly, implying that other factors may have some influence on \(n_{H}\), such as the anisotropic relaxation time \(\tau\) along the FSs with different temperature dependences [38, 41], if the shape of the electron pockets of LiFeSe-122 is far from cylindrical [35]. Moreover, \(n_{H}\) could also change at high temperature due to the thermal excitations of carriers among the narrow bands when the Fermi energy \(E_{F}\) is close to the bottom or top of a band [42].

The Hall angle \(\cot\theta_{H}=\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xy}\equiv 1/(\omega_{c}\tau_{H})\), where \(\omega_{c}\) is the cyclotron frequency and \(\tau_{H}\) is the relaxation time determined from the Hall angle, reveals more intrinsic features of the relaxation time. For iron-based SCs, \(\cot\theta_{H}\) usually follows a phenomenological formula, \(\cot\theta_{H}=BT^{\beta}+C\), with the exponent \(\beta\) being between 2 and 4 [43]. In contrast, \(\cot\theta_{H}\) of LiFeSe-122 exhibits strong temperature dependence and increases quickly when \(T>180\) K [Fig. 5(d)]. The fit between 50 and 250 K using the above function gives \(\beta=9.3(3)\), which is enormously larger than the value in any other iron-based SC. The origin of such a large \(\beta\) is still unclear, and one possible explanation for the significant enhancement of \(\cot\theta_{H}\) above 180 K could be the emergence of the multiband effect because of thermal excitations of hole-type carriers at high temperature. Thus, either an anisotropic \(\tau\) or the multiband behavior at high temperature may lead to the violation of Kohler's rule in LiFeSe-122.

## IV Discussion

The space group of both LiFeSe-122 and K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) is \(14/mmm\), while it is \(P4/mmm\) for FeSe-1111. It has been argued that this difference results in distinct electronic structures in the two classes of compounds and will strongly affect the pairing symmetry of K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\)[44]. However, due to material complexity, the pairing symmetry of K\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) has not been fully settled, although there are already a number of theoretical proposals [45, 46, 47]. Given the same structural symmetry and similar electron doping level, we expect studying the superconducting pairing of LiFeSe-122 can solve this open issue. Despite the different lattice structures, both LiFeSe-122 and FeSe-11111 exhibit large anisotropy in both normal and superconducting states, and they have comparable \(T_{c}\)[24]. The electronic anisotropy is likely associated with the very large structural anisotropy (large \(d\) values) among the iron-based SCs, which gives rise to a highly 2D electronic structure.

To understand the comparable \(T_{c}\) in LiFeSe-122 and other HED FeSe-based SCs, we summarize the \(T_{c}\) values with the inter-FeSe-layer distance \(d\) and the electron doping level in Fig. 6 (data are taken from the literature [7, 39, 48, 49, 50, 51]). A previous study summarizing the relationship between \(T_{c}\) and the \(d\) value implies that \(T_{c}\) will increase with increasing \(d\) until \(d\approx 8.5\) A, above which \(T_{c}\) saturates [52]. This seems to be valid for most HED FeSe-based SCs [Fig. 6(a)], but a recent work on gated-voltage-modulated FeSe flakes with \(T_{c}^{\rm onset}\sim 48\) K [emphasized in Fig. 6(a) by the black circle] [39] indicated that the \(d\) value may not be a major factor of the enhancement of superconductivity in FeSe-based SCs. More importantly, notice that all high-\(T_{c}\) FeSe-based SCs at ambient pressure with increased \(d\) values are HED. The results summarized in Fig. 6(b) indicate that the high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity emerges and is robust against the size variety of electron pockets once the electron doping level is larger than \(0.05\,e/\)Fe. One exception is A\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\), which shows an electron doping level similar to that of LiFeSe-122

(d) \(\cot\theta_{H}\) as a function of temperature. The solid line is the fit using the expression \(BT^{\beta}+C\).

  but with much lower \(T_{c}\) (\(\sim\)30 K) [7]. The existence of Fe vacancies in FeSe layers could be closely related to the suppression of \(T_{c}\). When the Fe vacancies are ordered in many FeSe-based SCs, such as Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Se and K\({}_{2}\)Fe\({}_{4}\)Se\({}_{5}\), these compounds become insulators and are regarded as the parent phases of FeSe-based SCs [53, 54]. Once the Fe vacancy order is suppressed by either disorder or Fe filling, the superconductivity emerges [54, 55]. Furthermore, if the Fe vacancies in A\({}_{x}\)Fe\({}_{2-y}\)Se\({}_{2}\) are fully filled, another SC phase coexisting with the 30 K SC phase will appear, and \(T_{c}\) will drastically increase to 44 K [56]. This suggests that the Fe vacancies are possibly disadvantageous to superconductivity. As for m-FeSe/STO films, they have the highest \(T_{c}\), and their carrier doping levels range between those of LiFeSe-122 and FeSe-11111. This implies that either an optimal doping level exists or other factors may influence superconductivity. For example, the interfacial coupling between the FeSe film and the STO substrate could be important to boosting \(T_{c}\) to an unprecedented value [14, 15, 16]. In addition, it should be noted that although in bulk FeSe \(T_{c}\) is enhanced to about 38 K after the suppression of nematicity (structural transition), the way to realize comparable \(T_{c}\) values in bulk FeSe and LiFeSe-122 could be very different because of their distinct electronic structures. The transport properties of FeSe under hydrostatic pressures up to 8.8 GPa indicate that the dominant carriers are hole type when the maximum \(T_{c}\) is about 38.3 K, and theoretical calculations imply that both electron and hole pockets exist in the Brillouin zone [57]. These results are different from the case of LiFeSe-122 or any other known HED FeSe-based SC in which the dominant carriers are electron type, associated with the electron pockets near the Brillouin zone corners.

## V V. Conclusion

In summary, we have successfully synthesized HED FeSe-based SC LiFeSe-122 single crystals. Our current observations of a LiFeSe-122 single crystal without materials complexity suggest that the superconductivity in HED FeSe-based SCs is determined mainly by the electron doping level, and in particular, the suppression of hole pockets is intimately related to the giant enhancement of \(T_{c}\) to 40-50 K. Moreover, once above a threshold value (0.05 \(e\)/Fe), \(T_{c}\) seems to be insensitive to the carrier concentration and strong anisotropy of \(\tau\), i.e., insensitive to the sizes and shapes of electron pockets. These results will impose some constraints on theories. In practice, many kinds of AM as well as organic molecules can be intercalated between FeSe layers, and by carefully choosing suitable combinations of AM and organic molecules, the electron doping level, crystallographic structure, and strength of inter-FeSe-layer coupling can be fine-tuned. Therefore, this superconducting family provides a unique platform for studying the origin of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity in FeSe-based SCs.
