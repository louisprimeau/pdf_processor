###### Abstract

We performed an extensive investigation on the correlations among superconductivity, structural instability, and band filling in Nb1-_x_B2 materials. Structural measurements reveal that a notable phase transformation occurs at x  0.2, corresponding to the Fermi level (E_{F}) in the pseudogap with the minimum total density of states (DOS) as demonstrated by the first-principles calculations. Superconductivity in Nb1-_x_B2 generally becomes visible in the Nb-deficient materials with x  0.2. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements on B K edge directly demonstrated the presence of a chemical shift arising from the structural transformation. Our systematical experimental results in combination with theoretical analysis suggest that the emergence of hole states in the s bands plays an important role for understanding the superconductivity and structural transition in Nb1-_x_B2.

Magesium diboride (MgB2), as a phonon-mediated superconductor with T_{c}  39 K, has attracted considerable interest from both the theoretical and experimental viewpoints.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] The superconducting transitions in the MgB2 materials synthesized under a variety of conditions appear at around the limit of T_{c} as was suggested theoretically several decades ago for BCS.[3, 5, 7] Actually, superconductivity in the metal borides with an AlB2-type structure has been studied for several decades.[8, 9] In 1970, Cooper _et al._ reported the presence of superconductivity in both the Nb-B and Mo-B systems, and they also noted that the stoichiometric compounds, NbB2 and MoB2, in general were non-superconductors, and a few B-rich samples such as NbB2,5 show sharp superconducting transitions.[10] Recent investigations[7, 8, 9, 10] suggest that the Nb concentration in the Nb1-_x_B2 materials plays a significant role in the appearance of superconductivity. In the present study, we have prepared a series of samples with nominal compositions of Nb1-_x_B2 (0 < x < 0.7) under a high-pressure of 6 GPa. The structural properties, superconductivity, electronic structures, and the electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra have been systematically analyzed along with the modification of the Nb deficiency.

Samples with nominal compositions of Nb1-_x_B2 (_x_ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7) were synthesized under high pressure from Nb powder (99.9%) and B amorphous (97%). The amorphous B was preheated at 800 ^{\circ}C for 12 h in a vacuum to remove humidity and other volatile impurities. Mixed powers with the ratio for various x values were mounted into a sintered BN tube. The samples were heated to 1200 ^{\circ}C in 10 min and sintered for 0.5 h under a pressure of 6 GPa using a cubic-anvil-type equipment. They were quenched to room temperature within a few seconds. The TEM investigations were performed on a Tecnai F20 (200 kV) electron microscope equipped with a post column Gatan imaging filter. The energy resolution in the EELS spectra is 0.7 eV under normal operating conditions. Under parallel illumination, the convergence angle is about 0.7 mrad and the spectrometer collection angle is ~1.0 mrad.

Theoretical calculations were performed based on the experimental structural parameters as given in Fig. 1(a) and Ref. 7 The theoretical EELS data were simulated by the TELNES program of the WIEN2K distribution.[11] Self-consistency was carried out on a 12 x 12 x 10 mesh for NbB2. The _R_m_K_max was set to 7.0 to determine the basis size. Both the energy and the charge density were well converged, to less than 10^{-5} and 10^{-4}, respectively. For the disordered Nb-vacancy calculations, we use the SPR-KKR code,[12] which accounts for the disordered atoms by using the coherent potential approximation (CPA) alloy theory.[13]

The crystal structures and dc susceptibilities of the Nb1-_x_B2 materials have been firstly measured by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and SQUID, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the Nb1-_x_B2 samples with 0 < x < 0.2 occasionally contain some additional weak peaks in the XRD patterns, possibly arising from impurity phases. Measurements of DC susceptibility on the materials with 0 <= x < 0.2 show very weak diamagnetism at low temperatures, suggesting the existence of superconducting phase in a small fraction of a sample. Samples with 0.3 <= x  0.5 in general show very sharp superconducting transitions just below the critical temperatures of around 8 K.

Figure 1(a) displays the compositional dependence of the lattice parameters (_a_ and _c_). It is remarkable that both the a and c lattice parameters show abrupt changes at around x = 0.2, i.e., an evident contraction within the _a_-_b_ plane and an expansion along the _c_-axis direction. This abrupt change cannot be attributed simply to the Nb deficiency; the alternation of electronic structure is likely to be the key reason to account for this transition as discussed in the following context. Previously, structural instability and changes of lattice parameters were reported by Yamamoto _et al._,[7] who found sudden changes of lattice parameters in a slightly Nb-deficient sample, Nb0.96B2. In our experiments, we carefully checked the structural properties of several series of samples prepared under different conditions, and our measurements indicate that the phase transition in general occurs at around x = 0.2.

  Figure 1(b) shows the temperature dependences of dc susceptibility for a number of Nb1-R2 samples. The inset illustrates the data for 0  .x  .2, showing the presence of weak diamagnetism arising from a small fraction of superconducting phase in the materials. This weak superconductivity was considered to arise from a superconducting impurity, such as unreacted Nb-metal.7 Large superconducting volume fraction and sharp transitions at ~7.5 K were observed in most samples with x ranging from 0.3 to 0.5. The maximum critical temperature T_{c} is observed at the temperature of 8.1 K in Nb0.7B2 material. In Fig. 1(c) we display the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) and the superconducting volume fraction (SVF) as the functions of Nb deficiency (_x_) obtained in our experiments. Our systematic measurements suggest that the superconductivity chiefly exists in the range of 0.2 < x < 0.4, in good agreement with the theoretical results obtained by Thomas Joseph _et al._,14 who suggested the superconductivity appears progressively as x grows larger than 0.2.

In order to better understand the effects of Nb vacancies on the electronic structure of Nb1-R2 materials, we have further calculated the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) of NbB2 using the augmented plane wave (APW) method by WIEN2k code.11 Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the LDA band structure and DOS for NbB2, and these results are fundamentally in agreement with the results obtained in Ref. 15. The electronic states near the Fermi level (E_{F}) are mainly Nb d and B p orbitals. In contrast with the flat bands of the MgB2 superconductor along the \Gamma - A line (the _c_-axis direction), the electronic bands of Nb1-R2 show up clear dispersion in the c direction. This fact likely suggests a relatively stronger interplanar coupling existing in the NbB2 system.

The electronic band structure and density of states of Nb1-R2 in visible Nb vacancies (0.1 <= x  0.3) were calculated by CPA method to simulate the effects of the random distributed Nb vacancies, and Fig. 3 shows the DOS and band structures for Nb1-R2 with x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. It is notable that the total DOS of these materials commonly has a sharp valley at around the E_{F} (which was termed as a pseudogap in certain previous publications), as clearly indicated by arrows in Fig. 3(a). All Nb1-R2 compounds possess finite N(E_{F}) at the Fermi level and, therefore, exhibit metallic behavior. It is notable that the introduction of Nb vacancies could result in remarkable shifts of the Fermi level with significant changes of DOS near the E_{F}. The Bloch spectral function, plotted as a "smeared" band structure, is shown in Fig. 3(b). The most striking feature is the broadening of the s bands at the A point along with the increasing of vacancy concentrations. In Nb0.9B2, the two s bonding bands remain comparatively sharp below the Fermi level, the E_{F} locates at ~1 eV above the pseudogap, and the antibonding states are partially occupied. In Nb0.8B2, the widths of the two s bands are apparently enlarged, especially at the A point, which

  makes the antibonding states shift upward and become completely unoccupied. The Fermi level shifts to the DOS minimum in the pseudogap. In Nb0.7B2, the broadening of the \sigma bands becomes notably visible due to the increase of both vacancy concentration and disorder effect. As a result, the E_{F} shifts to about \sim1 eV below the pseudogap and the hole states appear in the \sigma bonding bands. These facts suggest that the rigid band model is not very suitable for describing the electronic band changes in present system. For instance, the valence bands in the Nb-deficient superconductors extend much greater around A point than at the other points in the Brillouin zone. The partially occupied antibonding states in the materials with 0 \leqx<0.2 could result in lattice expansion within the a-b plane as observed in measurements of the x-ray diffraction.

In previous studies, EELS analysis has been performed on MgB2 superconductor to reveal the anisotropic excitations of hole states.[16, 17] The results suggest that the prepeak at the K edge of boron in MgB2 is directly related to the hole concentration.[16, 17, 18, 19] The similar discussions on the relationship between the charge carrier and the prepeak of the O K edge have been widely analyzed in the high-T_{c} superconducting oxides.[20, 21] Figure 4(a) shows the experimental B K-edge core-loss EELS data for several Nb1-xB2 samples in which the plural scattering was removed by Fourier-Log deconvolution;[21] the spectral simulation for NbB2 was performed by the TELNES program of the WIEN2k distribution. All the spectra contain three major features within 15 eV above the edge onset: the prepeak \bm{a} at \sim187 eV, the peak \bm{b} at \sim193 eV, and the peak \bm{c} at \sim198 eV. In order to understand the major excitations in connection with each peak, we have performed a careful analysis. Actually, the primary excitations toward the unoccupied states can be well explained based on the DOS of NbB2 [Fig. 2(b)], in which the electronic features originating from B \sigma(p_{xy}) and B \pi(p_{z}) are clearly indicated in the inset. The unoccupied states from E_{F} to \sim4 eV above E_{F} are governed mainly by the B p_{xy} character around the \Gamma point, which corresponds to the peak \bm{a} in the experimental spectra. The peak \bm{b} can be attributed to the transition from B 1s to the B p_{z} states appearing mainly at about 4-8 eV above the E_{F}. The peak \bm{c} contains the excitations towards B p_{xy} bands ranging from 8 to 14 eV above the E_{F}. One of the striking features illustrated in Fig. 4(a) is the intensity increase of the peak \bm{a} along with the increase of the Nb vacancies. To quantitatively illustrate the intensity change of this peak in the B K edge, all the spectra are first normalized to account for variations in sample thickness or acquisition times and then, a Gaussian function is used to fit the experimental spectra as shown in Figs. 4(b)-4(d). The relative peak \bm{a} intensity as the integral area of the first Gaussian function located at \sim187 eV is shown in Fig. 4(e). It can be clearly recognized that the experimental peak in

  tensities increase monotonically with the increase of Nb vacancy. This increase can be well interpreted as the hole states induced by Nb vacancies are chiefly added to the B p_{xy} band. The density of \sigma states therefore increases progressively near the E_{F}. It is also noted that the positions of peak a, b, and c shift systematically about 1.1, 0.7, and 0.7 eV toward the high-energy direction in the superconducting samples (x\!>\!0.2) compared with the non-superconducting ones (x\!<\!0.2). This alternation is considered to arise not only from the changes of electronic structure, but also from the crystal structural transformation at x\!=\!0.2. Actually, this kind of edge shift in the EELS spectra in general is called chemical shift resulting from modifications of chemical bonds.[21]

It is worth comparing the properties of electronic structures of Nb_{1-x}B_{2} with that of the well-known MgB_{2} superconductor. The superconductivity in MgB_{2} is known to be driven by the \sigma holes in the band passing through \Gamma-A direction; these unoccupied states are strongly coupled with lattice vibrations.[22, 23] The DOS near the E_{F} is mostly attributed to B p_{xy} states (bands crossing the E_{F} through the \Gamma-A line) and B p_{z} states (bands crossing the E_{F} through the \Gamma-M line), the Mg components near E_{F} are actually very small. On the other hand, the band structure calculations for Nb_{1-x}B_{2} [see Figs. 2(a) and 3(b)] reveal that the states near the E_{F} for NbB_{2} contains not only the B p component but also a notable contribution of Nb d character. The presence of Nb d states near the E_{F} could introduce covalent character in Nb-B bonds[15] and make the \sigma bonding bands sink below the Fermi level. The Nb deficiencies in Nb_{1-x}B_{2} could relatively lower the Fermi level and result in additional holes in the \sigma states. Hence, the appearance of superconductivity in Nb_{1-x}B_{2} materials with x\!>\!0.2 are considered fundamentally in connection with unoccupied \sigma states.

In summary, the structure and superconductivity of the Nb_{1-x}B_{2} system, especially at the critical point of around x =0.2, have been systematically investigated. A number of significant phenomena have been observed along with the increase of Nb vacancies: (a) superconductivity has been clearly observed in the materials with 0.2\,\approx\!x\!<\!0.5; (b) a structural transformation appears at this critical point with abrupt alterations of lattice parameters; and (c) EELS measurements on the Nb_{1-x}B_{2} materials directly revealed the chemical shifts arising from structural phase transition and visible increase of p_{xy}-hole states from additional Nb vacancies. Systematic experimental results in combination with theoretical analysis suggest that the emergence of hole states in the \sigma bands is important for an understanding of the superconductivity and structural transition in Nb_{1-x}B_{2} materials.

Magesium diboride (MgB2), as a phonon-mediated superconductor with T_{c}  39 K, has attracted considerable interest from both the theoretical and experimental viewpoints.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] The superconducting transitions in the MgB2 materials synthesized under a variety of conditions appear at around the limit of T_{c} as was suggested theoretically several decades ago for BCS.[3, 5, 7] Actually, superconductivity in the metal borides with an AlB2-type structure has been studied for several decades.[8, 9] In 1970, Cooper _et al._ reported the presence of superconductivity in both the Nb-B and Mo-B systems, and they also noted that the stoichiometric compounds, NbB2 and MoB2, in general were non-superconductors, and a few B-rich samples such as NbB2,5 show sharp superconducting transitions.[10] Recent investigations[7, 8, 9, 10] suggest that the Nb concentration in the Nb1-_x_B2 materials plays a significant role in the appearance of superconductivity. In the present study, we have prepared a series of samples with nominal compositions of Nb1-_x_B2 (0 < x < 0.7) under a high-pressure of 6 GPa. The structural properties, superconductivity, electronic structures, and the electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra have been systematically analyzed along with the modification of the Nb deficiency.

Samples with nominal compositions of Nb1-_x_B2 (_x_ = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7) were synthesized under high pressure from Nb powder (99.9%) and B amorphous (97%). The amorphous B was preheated at 800 ^{\circ}C for 12 h in a vacuum to remove humidity and other volatile impurities. Mixed powers with the ratio for various x values were mounted into a sintered BN tube. The samples were heated to 1200 ^{\circ}C in 10 min and sintered for 0.5 h under a pressure of 6 GPa using a cubic-anvil-type equipment. They were quenched to room temperature within a few seconds. The TEM investigations were performed on a Tecnai F20 (200 kV) electron microscope equipped with a post column Gatan imaging filter. The energy resolution in the EELS spectra is 0.7 eV under normal operating conditions. Under parallel illumination, the convergence angle is about 0.7 mrad and the spectrometer collection angle is ~1.0 mrad.

Theoretical calculations were performed based on the experimental structural parameters as given in Fig. 1(a) and Ref. 7 The theoretical EELS data were simulated by the TELNES program of the WIEN2K distribution.[11] Self-consistency was carried out on a 12 x 12 x 10 mesh for NbB2. The _R_m_K_max was set to 7.0 to determine the basis size. Both the energy and the charge density were well converged, to less than 10^{-5} and 10^{-4}, respectively. For the disordered Nb-vacancy calculations, we use the SPR-KKR code,[12] which accounts for the disordered atoms by using the coherent potential approximation (CPA) alloy theory.[13]

The crystal structures and dc susceptibilities of the Nb1-_x_B2 materials have been firstly measured by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and SQUID, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the Nb1-_x_B2 samples with 0 < x < 0.2 occasionally contain some additional weak peaks in the XRD patterns, possibly arising from impurity phases. Measurements of DC susceptibility on the materials with 0 <= x < 0.2 show very weak diamagnetism at low temperatures, suggesting the existence of superconducting phase in a small fraction of a sample. Samples with 0.3 <= x  0.5 in general show very sharp superconducting transitions just below the critical temperatures of around 8 K.

Figure 1(a) displays the compositional dependence of the lattice parameters (_a_ and _c_). It is remarkable that both the a and c lattice parameters show abrupt changes at around x = 0.2, i.e., an evident contraction within the _a_-_b_ plane and an expansion along the _c_-axis direction. This abrupt change cannot be attributed simply to the Nb deficiency; the alternation of electronic structure is likely to be the key reason to account for this transition as discussed in the following context. Previously, structural instability and changes of lattice parameters were reported by Yamamoto _et al._,[7] who found sudden changes of lattice parameters in a slightly Nb-deficient sample, Nb0.96B2. In our experiments, we carefully checked the structural properties of several series of samples prepared under different conditions, and our measurements indicate that the phase transition in general occurs at around x = 0.2.

  Figure 1(b) shows the temperature dependences of dc susceptibility for a number of Nb1-R2 samples. The inset illustrates the data for 0  .x  .2, showing the presence of weak diamagnetism arising from a small fraction of superconducting phase in the materials. This weak superconductivity was considered to arise from a superconducting impurity, such as unreacted Nb-metal.7 Large superconducting volume fraction and sharp transitions at ~7.5 K were observed in most samples with x ranging from 0.3 to 0.5. The maximum critical temperature T_{c} is observed at the temperature of 8.1 K in Nb0.7B2 material. In Fig. 1(c) we display the superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) and the superconducting volume fraction (SVF) as the functions of Nb deficiency (_x_) obtained in our experiments. Our systematic measurements suggest that the superconductivity chiefly exists in the range of 0.2 < x < 0.4, in good agreement with the theoretical results obtained by Thomas Joseph _et al._,14 who suggested the superconductivity appears progressively as x grows larger than 0.2.

In order to better understand the effects of Nb vacancies on the electronic structure of Nb1-R2 materials, we have further calculated the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) of NbB2 using the augmented plane wave (APW) method by WIEN2k code.11 Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the LDA band structure and DOS for NbB2, and these results are fundamentally in agreement with the results obtained in Ref. 15. The electronic states near the Fermi level (E_{F}) are mainly Nb d and B p orbitals. In contrast with the flat bands of the MgB2 superconductor along the \Gamma - A line (the _c_-axis direction), the electronic bands of Nb1-R2 show up clear dispersion in the c direction. This fact likely suggests a relatively stronger interplanar coupling existing in the NbB2 system.

The electronic band structure and density of states of Nb1-R2 in visible Nb vacancies (0.1 <= x  0.3) were calculated by CPA method to simulate the effects of the random distributed Nb vacancies, and Fig. 3 shows the DOS and band structures for Nb1-R2 with x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. It is notable that the total DOS of these materials commonly has a sharp valley at around the E_{F} (which was termed as a pseudogap in certain previous publications), as clearly indicated by arrows in Fig. 3(a).

  makes the antibonding states shift upward and become completely unoccupied. The Fermi level shifts to the DOS minimum in the pseudogap. In Nb0.7B2, the broadening of the \sigma bands becomes notably visible due to the increase of both vacancy concentration and disorder effect. As a result, the E_{F} shifts to about \sim1 eV below the pseudogap and the hole states appear in the \sigma bonding bands. These facts suggest that the rigid band model is not very suitable for describing the electronic band changes in present system. For instance, the valence bands in the Nb-deficient superconductors extend much greater around A point than at the other points in the Brillouin zone. The partially occupied antibonding states in the materials with 0 \leqx<0.2 could result in lattice expansion within the a-b plane as observed in measurements of the x-ray diffraction.

In previous studies, EELS analysis has been performed on MgB2 superconductor to reveal the anisotropic excitations of hole states.[16, 17] The results suggest that the prepeak at the K edge of boron in MgB2 is directly related to the hole concentration.[16, 17, 18, 19] The similar discussions on the relationship between the charge carrier and the prepeak of the O K edge have been widely analyzed in the high-T_{c} superconducting oxides.[20, 21] Figure 4(a) shows the experimental B K-edge core-loss EELS data for several Nb1-xB2 samples in which the plural scattering was removed by Fourier-Log deconvolution;[21] the spectral simulation for NbB2 was performed by the TELNES program of the WIEN2k distribution. All the spectra contain three major features within 15 eV above the edge onset: the prepeak \bm{a} at \sim187 eV, the peak \bm{b} at \sim193 eV, and the peak \bm{c} at \sim198 eV. In order to understand the major excitations in connection with each peak, we have performed a careful analysis. Actually, the primary excitations toward the unoccupied states can be well explained based on the DOS of NbB2 [Fig. 2(b)], in which the electronic features originating from B \sigma(p_{xy}) and B \pi(p_{z}) are clearly indicated in the inset. The unoccupied states from E_{F} to \sim4 eV above E_{F} are governed mainly by the B p_{xy} character around the \Gamma point, which corresponds to the peak \bm{a} in the experimental spectra. The peak \bm{b} can be attributed to the transition from B 1s to the B p_{z} states appearing mainly at about 4-8 eV above the E_{F}. The peak \bm{c} contains the excitations towards B p_{xy} bands ranging from 8 to 14 eV above the E_{F}. One of the striking features illustrated in Fig. 4(a) is the intensity increase of the peak \bm{a} along with the increase of the Nb vacancies. To quantitatively illustrate the intensity change of this peak in the B K edge, all the spectra are first normalized to account for variations in sample thickness or acquisition times and then, a Gaussian function is used to fit the experimental spectra as shown in Figs. 4(b)-4(d). The relative peak \bm{a} intensity as the integral area of the first Gaussian function located at \sim187 eV is shown in Fig. 4(e). It can be clearly recognized that the experimental peak in

  tensities increase monotonically with the increase of Nb vacancy. This increase can be well interpreted as the hole states induced by Nb vacancies are chiefly added to the B p_{xy} band. The density of \sigma states therefore increases progressively near the E_{F}. It is also noted that the positions of peak a, b, and c shift systematically about 1.1, 0.7, and 0.7 eV toward the high-energy direction in the superconducting samples (x\!>\!0.2) compared with the non-superconducting ones (x\!<\!0.2). This alternation is considered to arise not only from the changes of electronic structure, but also from the crystal structural transformation at x\!=\!0.2. Actually, this kind of edge shift in the EELS spectra in general is called chemical shift resulting from modifications of chemical bonds.[21]

It is worth comparing the properties of electronic structures of Nb_{1-x}B_{2} with that of the well-known MgB_{2} superconductor. The superconductivity in MgB_{2} is known to be driven by the \sigma holes in the band passing through \Gamma-A direction; these unoccupied states are strongly coupled with lattice vibrations.[22, 23] The DOS near the E_{F} is mostly attributed to B p_{xy} states (bands crossing the E_{F} through the \Gamma-A line) and B p_{z} states (bands crossing the E_{F} through the \Gamma-M line), the Mg components near E_{F} are actually very small. On the other hand, the band structure calculations for Nb_{1-x}B_{2} [see Figs. 2(a) and 3(b)] reveal that the states near the E_{F} for NbB_{2} contains not only the B p component but also a notable contribution of Nb d character. The presence of Nb d states near the E_{F} could introduce covalent character in Nb-B bonds[15] and make the \sigma bonding bands sink below the Fermi level. The Nb deficiencies in Nb_{1-x}B_{2} could relatively lower the Fermi level and result in additional holes in the \sigma states. Hence, the appearance of superconductivity in Nb_{1-x}B_{2} materials with x\!>\!0.2 are considered fundamentally in connection with unoccupied \sigma states.

In summary, the structure and superconductivity of the Nb_{1-x}B_{2} system, especially at the critical point of around x =0.2, have been systematically investigated. A number of significant phenomena have been observed along with the increase of Nb vacancies: (a) superconductivity has been clearly observed in the materials with 0.2\,\approx\!x\!<\!0.5; (b) a structural transformation appears at this critical point with abrupt alterations of lattice parameters; and (c) EELS measurements on the Nb_{1-x}B_{2} materials directly revealed the chemical shifts arising from structural phase transition and visible increase of p_{xy}-hole states from additional Nb vacancies. Systematic experimental results in combination with theoretical analysis suggest that the emergence of hole states in the \sigma bands is important for an understanding of the superconductivity and structural transition in Nb_{1-x}B_{2} materials.
