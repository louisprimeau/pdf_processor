## I Introduction

The discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in FeAs-based layered
quaternary compound LaFeAsO_(1 − x)Sr_(x) has attracted great interest
in the fields of condensed-matter physics and material sciences.[1, 2]
The family of the FeAs-based superconductors has been extended rapidly
and it can be divided into three categories. The first category has the
general formula of REFeAsO where RE stands for the rare-earth elements
and is abbreviated as the FeAs-1111 phase.[3] The second class is
formulated as (Ba,Sr)_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAs₂As₂ which is denoted as FeAs-122
for simplicity.[4, 5] The third type Li_(x)FeAs has an infinite layered
structure (denoted as FeAs-111).[6, 7, 8] As for the FeAs-1111 phase,
most of the discovered superconductors are characterized as electron
doped ones and the superconducting transition temperature has been
quickly raised to _T_(c)_ = 55∼ 56 K via replacing lanthanum with other
rare-earth elements.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] About the hole-doped side,
however, since the first hole-doped superconductor La_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO
with _T_(c)_ = 25 K was discovered,[15, 16] only the Nd-based system
Nd_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO with _T_(c)_ = 13.5 K was reported.[17] Obviously,
there is an extensive space to explore more superconductors in the
hole-doped side based on the FeAs-1111 phase and to further extend the
family of the FeAs-based superconductors. Moreover it is also
significant to investigate the basic physical properties of the
hole-doped system based on the FeAs-1111 phase.

In this paper we report a new route to easily synthesize the hole-doped
superconductors based on the FeAs-1111 phase, Sr doped
Pr_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO, with the maximum superconducting transition
temperature of 16.3 K. We carried out a systematic study on the
evolution of the superconductivity and the lattice constants with the
content of Sr or hole concentration in the system of
Pr_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO. We found that the a and c axes lattice constants
increase monotonously with doped concentration of Sr or hole numbers.
The physical properties of a selected sample with x = 0.25 were
investigated in depth. The conducting charge carriers in this sample
were characterized to be hole type by the Hall-effect measurements.
Moreover, it is found that the MR data show a good two-band behavior. We
also estimated the upper critical field of the same sample based on the
Ginzburg-Landau theory as well as the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH)
formula.[18] It is suggested that the upper critical fields in the
hole-doped samples may be higher than that in the electron-doped ones.

## II Experimental Details

The Pr_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO samples were prepared using a two-step
solid-state reaction method. In the first step, PrAs and SrAs were
prepared by reacting Pr flakes (purity 99.99

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of our samples were carried out
by a _Mac-Science_ MXP18A-HF equipment with _th_-2_th_ scan. The dc
magnetization measurements were done with a superconducting quantum
interference device [Quantum Design, superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID), MPMS7] and the ac susceptibility of the
samples were measured on the Maglab-12T (Oxford) with an ac field of 0.1
Oe and a frequency of 333 Hz. The resistance and Hall-effect
measurements were done using a six-probe technique on the Quantum Design
instrument physical property measurement system (PPMS) with magnetic
fields up to 9 T. The temperature stabilization was better than 0.1

## III III. Experimental data and discussion

### A. Resistive and diamagnetic transition

In Fig. 1(a) we present a typical set of resistive data for the sample
Pr1-xSr_(x)FeAsO with x = 0.25 under 0 and 9 T near the superconducting
transition. One can see that the resistivity transition at zero field is
rather sharp indicating the quite high quality of our sample, and the
onset transition temperature is about 16.3 K taking a criterion of 95

Shown in Fig. 2 is the temperature dependence of resistivity under zero
field up to 300 K for the same sample as shown in Fig. 1. The
resistivity data in the normal state were fitted using the formula

ρ = ρ₀ + AT^(n),
(1)

as we had done in the F-doped LaFeAsO system.[19] As represented by the
red solid line in Fig. 2, the data below about 150 K can be roughly
fitted with the fitting parameters ρ₀ =0.306  mΩ cm and n = 2.000. The
fine quadratic dependent behavior of the resistivity, which is
consistent with the prediction of the Fermi-liquid theory, may suggest a
rather strong scattering between electrons in the present system in the
low-temperature region. In a high-temperature region above about 150 K,
however, a flattening of resistivity was observed clearly. The similar
behavior has been observed in other hole-doped FeAs-1111 systems
La_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO and Nd_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO,[15, 16, 17] and also in
the FeAs-122 system (Ba,Sr)_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂.[4] We have pointed out
that this behavior may be a common feature of the hole-doped FeAs-based
superconductors.[16]

### B. Doping dependence of lattice constants and superconducting
properties

The XRD patterns for the samples with the nominal doping levels of
0.05 ∼ 0.25 are shown in Fig. 3. Some small peaks from small amount of
FeAs impurity phase which were denoted by red asterisks can still be
seen, and the sample with x = 0.05 has a bit more impurity phase FeAs
than other samples. However, it is clear that all the main peaks can be
indexed to the FeAs-1111 phase with the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type
structure. By having a closer scrutiny one can find that the diffraction
peaks shift slightly to the low-angle side when more strontiums are
doped into the samples, suggesting an expanding effect of the lattice
constants. The similar behavior has been observed in the Sr-doped
LaFeAsO system previously.[16] By using the software of Powder-X,[20] we
took a general fit to the XRD data of each sample and determined the
lattice constants. The doping dependence of the lattice constants
calculated from the XRD data, along with the data of the undoped and 11

Figure 2: (Color online) The resistivity curve at 0 T in the temperature
region up to 300 K for the sample with x = 0.25. A flattening of
resistivity in high-temperature region is obvious, which seems to be a
common feature of the hole-doped FeAs-based superconductors (Refs. [4,
15, 16]). The red solid line shows the fit below about 150 K using the
formula ρ=ρ₀+AT^(n).

magnetization for the zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC)
process at H = 10 Oe. The inset shows the ac susceptibility of the same
sample measured with _H__(ac)=0.1 Oe, f = 333 Hz.

PrFeAsO samples,[11] are presented in Fig. 4. It is clear that both the
a and c axes lattice constants expand monotonously from 11

In Fig. 5 we show the resistivity data of our samples made at various
nominal doping levels of Sr ranging from x =0.05 to 0.25. A clear but
rounded resistivity anomaly can be seen around 155 ∼ 175 K when the
doping level is 5

### Hall effect

It is known that for a conventional metal with Fermi-liquid feature, the
Hall coefficient is almost independent of temperature. However, this
situation is changed for a multi-band material[23] or a sample with
non-Fermi liquid behavior, such as the cuprate superconductors.[24] To
get more information about the conducting carriers, we measured the Hall

constant; (b) _c_-axis lattice constant. The black filled squares
represent data from our measurements. For electron-doped side, the
variable “_x_” represents the fluorine concentration. The data of the
undoped and F-doped cases (red filled circles) are taken from the work
of Ren _et al._ (Ref. [11]). One can see that the lattice constant
roughly show a monotonous variation versus doping from electron doped
region to hole-doped one.

samples Pr_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO with x =0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25.
One can see that the resistivity anomaly is suppressed gradually by
doping more Sr into the system. The maximum onset transition temperature
appears around the nominal doping level of 0.20 ∼ 0.25.

Pr_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO samples with different doping levels: x =0.05,

indexed to the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure. Small amount of
impurity phases were denoted by red asterisks.

effect of the sample with x = 0.25 (the same one as shown in Fig. 1).
Figure 6(a) shows the magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity
(_r_xy) at different temperatures. In the experiment _r_xy was taken as
_r_xy = [_r_(+H)-_r_(-H)]/2 at each point to eliminate the effect of the
misaligned Hall electrodes. It is clear that all curves in Fig. 6(a)
have good linearity versus the magnetic field. Moreover, _r_xy is
positive at all temperatures below 250 K giving a positive Hall
coefficient R_(H) = _r_xy/_H_, which actually indicates that hole type
charge carriers dominate the conduction in the present sample.

The temperature dependence of R_(H) is shown in Fig. 6(b). Very similar
to that observed in La1-Sr,FeAsO samples,[15,16] the Hall coefficient
R_(H) reveals a huge hump in the intermediate temperature regime and the
value of R_(H) decreases down to zero at about 250 K, then it becomes
slightly negative above that temperature. Here we employ a simple
two-band scenario with different types of carriers to interpret this
behavior. We have known that for a two-band system in the low-field
limit, the Hall coefficient R_(H) can be written as

$$R_{H} = \frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}R_{1} + \sigma_{i}^{2}R_{2}}{\left( \sigma_{1} + \sigma_{2} \right)^{2}},$$

where s_(i) (_i_ = 1, 2) is the conductance for different types of
charge carriers in different bands, and R_(i) = -1/_n__i_ are represents
the Hall coefficient for each type of carrier separately with n_(i) the
concentration of the charge carriers for the different bands. We
attribute the strong temperature dependence of R_(H) in the present
system to the complicated variation of the conductance s_(i) with
temperature, which reflects mainly the temperature dependent behavior of
the scattering relaxation time. Moreover the sign-changing effect of
R_(H) may indicate the presence of two different types of charge
carriers (electron and hole type) in the present system. The conductance
s_(i) of electronlike and holelike carriers may vary differently with
temperature, and the electronlike carriers become dominant when the
temperature is higher than about 250 K.

This simple two-band model is consistent with the MR data (will be
addressed in Sec. III.4). However, if there are two types of carriers in
two bands, we may expect r_(y) to be quadratic in magnetic field. The
linear behavior in the _r_xy,  _H_ curve shown in Fig. 6(a) seems to be
not agree with this scenario. So further measurements with higher
magnetic fields are required.

### Magnetoresistance

Magnetoresistance is a very powerful tool to investigate the electronic
scattering process and the information about the Fermi surface.[23,25]
Field dependence of MR, for the sample with x = 0.25 at different
temperatures is shown in the main frame of Fig. 7(a). Here MR was
expressed as Δρ/ρ₀ =[_r_(_H_) - r0]/_r_0, where _r_(_H_) and r0
represent the longitudinal resistivity at a magnetic field H and that
are zero field, respectively. One can see that the curve obtained at 20
K reveals a rather different feature compared with the data at
temperatures above 25 K. Also the magnitude of MR (obtained at 9 T) at
20 K reached two times of that at 25 K giving a sharp drop in the Δρ/ρ₀
  T curve when increasing the temperature as revealed in the main frame
of Fig. 7. We attribute this behavior to the presence of fluctuant
superconductivity in the low-temperature region ( 16.3-20 K). At

coefficient R_(H). A huge hump appears in the intermediate temperature
region, which seems to be a common feature for the hole-doped FeAs-based
superconductors.

temperatures for the sample with x = 0.25. The inset shows Kohler plot
of the same sample. It is clear that Kohler’s rule is not obeyed. (b)

temperatures higher than 150 K, the value of MR vanishes to zero
gradually.

As for the case in the moderate temperature region, the D_r_/_r_0  _H_
curve reveals a clear nonlinear behavior. In the inset of Fig. 7(b) we
present the data at five typical temperatures in this region. These data
were then fitted based on a simple two-band model which gave the
following formula:

$$\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_{0}} = \frac{(\mu_{0}H)^{2}}{\alpha + \beta \times (\mu_{0}H)^{2}},$$

with a and b as the fitting parameters which were related to the
conductances and mobilities for the charge carriers in two bands. The
fitting results were shown by the solid lines in the inset of Fig. 7(b).
It is clear that Eq. (3) can describe our data quite well. This argument
can be further confirmed by seeing about the situation of the so-called
Kohler plot. The semiclassical transport theory has predicted that the
Kohler rule, which can be written as

$$\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_{0}} = F\left( \frac{\mu_{0}H}{\rho_{0}} \right),$$

will be held if only one isotropic relaxation time is present in a
single-band solid-state system.[26] Equation (4) means that the
D_r_/_r_0 vs _m__H_/_r_0 curves for different temperatures should be
scaled to a universal curve if the Kohler rule is obeyed. The scaling
based on the Kohler plot for the present sample is revealed in the inset
of Fig. 7(a). An obvious violation of the Kohler rule can be seen on
this plot. We attribute this behavior to the presence of a multiband
effect in the present system.

Actually, theoretical research and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopic (ARPES) studies have shown a rather complicated Fermi
surface and energy-band structure in the FeAs-based superconductors. Our
data from measuring the Hall effect and MR are consistent with these
conclusions.

### E. Upper critical field

Finally, we attempted to estimate the upper critical field of the sample
with x = 0.25 from the resistivity data. Temperature dependence of
resistivity under different magnetic fields is shown in the main frame
of Fig. 8. Similar to that found in the F-doped LaFeAsO polycrystalline
samples,[19, 27] the onset transition point, which reflects mainly the
upper critical field in the configuration of H∥ab-plane, shifts more
slowly than the zero resistivity point to low temperatures under fields.
We take a criterion of 95

$$H_{c2}(T) = H_{c2}(0)\frac{1 - t^{2}}{1 + t^{2}},$$

where t = _T_/_T__c_ is the reduced temperature and _H__c_2(0) is the
upper critical field at zero temperature. Taking T_(c) = 16.3 K and
_H__c_2(0) as the adjustable parameter, the measured data in the inset
of Fig. 8 were then fitted using Eq. (5). One can see a quite good fit
in the inset of Fig. 8 as revealed by the red solid line. The
zero-temperature upper critical field was determined to be _H__c_2(0)  
52 T from the fitting process. Actually one can also determine the slope
of _H__c_2(_T_) near T_(c), which is found to be about -4.0 T/K in the
present sample. By using the WHH formula[18] the value of
zero-temperature upper critical field _H__c_2(0) can be estimated
through

$$H_{c2}(0) = - 0.693T_{c}\left( \frac{dH_{c2}}{dT} \right)_{T = T_{c}}.$$

Taking T_(c) = 16.3 K, we get _H__c_2(0)   45.1 T. Regarding the
relatively low value of T_(c) = 16.3 K in the present sample, this value
of upper critical field _H__c_2(0) is actually quite high. The slope of
_dH__c_2(_T_)/_dT_|_T__c_ in the hole-doped sample is clearly larger
than that in the electron-doped samples. In the hole-doped
La_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO superconducting samples, we also found much larger
_dH__c_2(_T_)/_dT_|_T__c_ when comparing it with the F-doped LaFeAsO
sample.[19, 27] This may be understood as due to the higher
quasiparticle density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level in the
hole-doped samples. In a dirty type-II superconductor, it was
predicted[29] that −dH_(c2)/dT|_(T_(c)) ∼ γ_(n) with g_(n) the
normal-state specific-heat coefficient which is proportional to the DOS
at E_(F). It is thus reasonable to ascribe the higher value of
dH_(c2)/dT|_(T_(c)) to higher DOS in the hole-doped samples. Theoretical
calculations do show that the DOS in the hole-doped side is larger than
that in the electron-doped samples.[30, 31] The measurements on lower
critical fields[32] and specific heat[33] in Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂
reveal that the superfluid density and the normal-state DOS is about
five to ten times larger than that in the F-doped REFeAsO system. If the
normal-state DOS is really larger in the hole-doped systems, higher
upper critical

onset transition temperature defined by 95

fields may be achieved in the hole-doped FeAs-1111 samples provided that
the superconducting transition temperature can be improved to the same
scale.

## IV Concluding remarks

In summary, bulk superconductivity was achieved by substituting Pr³⁺
with Sr²⁺ in PrFeAsO system. A systematic evolution of superconductivity
and the lattice constants with doping in hole doped
Pr_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO was discovered. By doping more Sr into the parent
phase PrFeAsO, the anomaly of resistivity at about 165 K is suppressed
gradually and the superconductivity eventually sets in. The a and c axes
lattice constants increase monotonously with Sr concentration. The
maximum superconducting transition temperature T_(c) = 16.3 K is found
to appear around the nominal doping level x = 0.20 ∼ 0.25. The positive
Hall coefficient R_(H) in a wide temperature range suggests that the
hole type charge carriers dominate the conduction in this system. The
strong temperature dependence and sign-changing effect of R_(H) were
attributed to a multiband effect and have been interpreted based on a
simple two-band model with different types of charge carriers. This
argument was further confirmed by the nonlinear field dependence of MR
and the violation of the Kohler rule. Interestingly, the slope of the
upper critical magnetic field vs temperature near T_(c) seems to be much
higher than that of the electron-doped samples. This is attributed to
the higher DOS in the hole-doped samples than in the electron-doped
ones. This may provide a new way to enhance the upper critical field in
the hole-doped FeAs-1111 superconductors.
