###### Abstract

We present evidence of type-I superconductivity in YbSb\({}_{2}\) single crystals from dc and ac magnetization, heat capacity, and resistivity measurements. The critical temperature and critical field are determined to be \(T_{c}\approx 1.3\) K and \(H_{c}\approx 55\) Oe. A small Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa=0.05\), together with typical magnetization isotherms of type-I superconductors, small critical field values, a strong differential paramagnetic effect signal, and a field-induced change from second- to first-order phase transition, confirms the type-I nature of the superconductivity in YbSb\({}_{2}\). A possible second superconducting state is observed in the radio-frequency susceptibility measurements, with \(T_{c}^{(2)}\approx 0.41\) K and \(H_{c}^{(2)}\approx 430\) Oe.

The in-plane magnetic penetration depth \(\Delta\lambda(T)\) was determined using a self-resonating tunnel-diode oscillator (TDR),[13] operating at 16 MHz with an amplitude of \(H_{\rm ac}\approx 10\) mOe, with temperatures down to 50 mK, and in static magnetic fields up to \(H_{\rm dc}=400\) Oe. The sample was mounted on a sapphire rod with the crystal plate perpendicular to both \(H_{\rm ac}\) and \(H_{\rm dc}\). Placing the sample into the inductor causes the shift of the resonant frequency \(\Delta f(T)=-G4\pi\,\chi(T)\), where \(G\) is a calibration constant determined by physically pulling the sample out of the coil. With the characteristic sample size \(R\), \(\Delta\lambda\) can be obtained from \(4\pi\,\chi=(\lambda/R)\tanh(R/\lambda)-1\).[14, 15]

## III Results and Discussion

The powder x-ray diffraction pattern of YbSb\({}_{2}\) is shown in Fig. 1. The pattern was refined using a ZrSi\({}_{2}\)-type orthorhombic structure with space group \(Cmcm\) and lattice parameters \(a=4.554\) A, \(b=16.715\) A, and \(c=4.267\) A, in good agreement with the previously reported values.[16] A small amount of remnant Sb flux (\(\sim\)5%) was found and is marked by a blue asterisk in Fig. 1.

Figure 2 shows the temperature-dependent dc magnetic susceptibility \(\chi\) of YbSb\({}_{2}\), measured in a field \(H\) parallel to the crystal plate for \(H=10\) and 20 Oe. The demagnetizing effect has been taken into account by calculating \(\chi=\chi_{\rm measured}/(1-M_{\rm J}\chi_{\rm measured})\), where \(\chi_{\rm measured}=M/H\) is the ratio of the measured magnetization \(M\) and the applied magnetic field \(H\). The demagnetization factor \(N_{d}\) is estimated to be 0.07 if we approximate the shape of the platelike crystal as an ellipsoid.[12] For both zero-field-cooled (ZFC, solid lines) and field-cooled (FC, dashed lines) data, the low-temperature susceptibility shows a clear Meissner signal at temperatures below \(T_{c}=1.25\) K for \(H=10\) Oe. The superconducting volume fraction estimated from the ZFC data at this field value is very close to 100%, indicative of bulk superconductivity. As expected, \(T_{c}\) is suppressed by increasing magnetic field. The dc magnetization isotherms \(M(H)\) for \(T=0.5\) and 1.0 K are shown in Fig. 3(a), before (solid symbols) and after (open symbols) the demagnetization correction. It is clear that the corrected \(M(H)\) curves show a steplike jump to zero near the critical field, characteristic of type-I superconductivity. The full magnetization loops [Fig. 3(b)] also have the shape typical of type-I superconductors.[17, 18, 19]

The ac susceptibility \(\chi^{\prime}\) of YbSb\({}_{2}\) as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 4. As the field increases from \(H=0\) to

  55 Oe, the onset temperature of the Meissner signal drops from 1.41 to 0.14 K. In a \(H=60\) Oe field, the superconductivity is further suppressed and cannot be detected down to 0.06 K. Similarly, a suppression of \(H_{c}\) with \(T\) from 56.3 Oe (\(T=0.06\) K) to 2.3 Oe (\(T=1.28\) K) is illustrated by the \(\chi^{\prime}(H)\) data in Fig. 5. The onset critical temperature \(T_{c}\) and critical field \(H_{c}\) values from ac susceptibility measurements are summarized in an \(H\)-\(T\) phase diagram in Fig. 10 and will be discussed later. A noteworthy feature of the \(\chi^{\prime}(T)\) and \(\chi^{\prime}(H)\) curves is the positive peak in the vicinity of the superconducting transition for \(H>0\), known as the differential paramagnetic effect in superconductors.[20] The DPE signal originates from the positive \(\partial M/\partial H\) values at temperatures right below \(H_{c}\) and can be observed in either type-I or type-II superconductors. Nevertheless, since the height of the DPE peak in type-II superconductors cannot exceed the absolute value of the diamagnetic susceptibility,[4] the observed large DPE signal (Figs. 4 and 5) clearly points to type-I superconductivity in YbSb\({}_{2}\).

The field dependence of the superconducting transition of YbSb\({}_{2}\) is further confirmed by heat capacity measurements in fields up to \(H=90\) kOe. For clarity, a subset of these data are shown in Fig. 6. In the \(H=0\) curve, a clear jump in the heat capacity confirms the bulk superconductivity. The transition temperature \(T_{c}\), determined at the midpoint of this jump, is close to 1.32 K and agrees well with the previous report.[7] As \(H\) increases, \(T_{c}\) monotonically decreases and drops below 0.4 K (the minimum available temperature for these measurements) at \(H=60\) Oe. The peak at the transition also becomes sharper and higher for \(H=10\) Oe, compared to that for \(H=0\), indicating a change from second- to first-order phase transition, commonly seen in type-I superconductors. As the field is further increased, a nonmonotonic change of the electronic and phonon specific heat coefficients \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\) is revealed by the \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) plots (Fig. 6, left inset). While this field dependence remains to be understood, it makes it difficult to determine the electronic specific heat jump \(\Delta C_{el}=C_{el,s}-C_{el,n}\) at \(T_{c}\). An additional difficulty in estimating \(\Delta C_{el}\) is a possible second superconducting transition at lower temperatures, which will be discussed below. We therefore use the \(H=0\)\(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) data (black line, Fig. 6, left inset) to estimate \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\) from the linear fit. This gives \(\gamma\approx 3.18\) mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}\) and \(\beta\approx 0.90\) mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-4}\). After subtracting the phonon contribution \(\rho_{ph}=\beta T^{3}\), the jump in the specific heat at the superconducting transition is estimated to be \(\Delta C_{el}/\gamma\,T_{c}\approx 0.85\) (Fig. 6, right inset), smaller than the BCS value of 1.43. As already mentioned, this could be due to a second superconducting transition and the nonmonotonic field dependence of \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\), as illustrated by a subset of \(C_{p}/T\,(T^{2})\) curves shown in the left inset in Fig. 6. The Debye temperature can also be estimated using \(\theta_{D}=(12\pi^{4}N_{A}rk_{B}/5\beta)^{1/3}\), where \(r=3\) is the number of atoms per formula unit. This yields \(\theta_{D}\approx 186\) K.

The ac resistivity of YbSb\({}_{2}\), for \(H=0\) and \(i\parallel\) plate, is shown in Fig. 7. At high temperatures, a linear temperature dependence of \(\rho(T)\) is evident, as expected for metals. As seen in the top inset, the resistivity drops to zero at \(T_{c}=1.25\) K, with a residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}(2\)K\()=0.53\)\(\mu\Omega\) cm just above \(T_{c}\). The residual resistivity ratio, calculated as \(RRR=\rho(300\) K\()/\rho(2\) K\()\), is around 186, indicative of a good quality metal. At temperatures below 8 K and above \(T_{c}\), the resistivity shows a quadratic dependence on temperature: \(\rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}\).

The left inset shows \(C_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) for \(H=0\), 60 Oe, 20 kOe, and 60 kOe, showing a field-dependent Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma\). The right inset shows the superconducting (squares) and normal (black line) electronic specific heat for \(H=0\), plotted as \(C_{el}/T\) vs \(T\). An entropy conservation construct (red lines) is used to determine the jump in the electronic specific heat at \(T_{c}\).

  From a linear fit of \(\Delta\rho=\rho-\rho_{0}\) vs \(T^{2}\), the coefficient \(A\) is determined to be \(0.0013\ \mu\Omega\) cm K\({}^{-2}\). The Kadowaki-Woods (KW) ratio \(A/\gamma^{2}=12.8a_{0}\), where \(a_{0}=10^{-5}\ \mu\Omega\) cm mol\({}^{2}\) K\({}^{2}\) mJ\({}^{-2}\) is a nearly universal value observed in strongly correlated electron systems.[21] This large KW ratio is consistent with the analogous value previously reported[6] and could be associated with electron-phonon scattering or enhanced electron correlations.

Based on the resistivity and heat capacity data, several superconducting parameters, such as the London penetration depth \(\lambda_{L}\), coherence length \(\xi\), Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa\), and electron-phonon coupling constant \(\lambda_{el-ph}\), can be estimated. With 4 formula units per unit cell volume (\(V\)), the electron density \(n\) of YbSb\({}_{2}\) can be calculated as \(n=8/V=2.483\times 10^{-2}\) A\({}^{-3}\), assuming the valence of Yb to be \(2+\) . The Fermi wave vector \(k_{F}\) can be roughly estimated if we assume a spherical Fermi surface, which gives \(k_{F}=(3n\pi^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}=0.903\) A\({}^{-1}\). The Fermi wave vector \(k_{F}\), together with the Sommerfeld coefficient \(\gamma=3.18\) mJ mol\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-2}=6.56\times 10^{-5}\) J cm\({}^{-3}\) K\({}^{-2}\), yields the effective electron mass \(m^{*}=\hbar^{2}k_{F}^{2}/\gamma^{2}mk_{B}^{2}=1.39m_{0}\), where \(m_{0}\) is the free-electron mass. The London penetration depth \(\lambda_{L}(0)\) and coherence length \(\xi(0)\) can also be derived as \(\lambda_{L}(0)=(m^{*}/\mu_{0}n\epsilon^{2})^{1/2}=40\) nm and \(\xi(0)=0.18\hbar^{2}k_{F}/k_{B}T_{c}m^{*}=826\) nm. It results that the GL parameter \(\kappa=\lambda_{L}(0)/\xi(0)=0.05\ll 1/\sqrt{2}\), confirming the type-I superconductivity in YbSb\({}_{2}\). According to the McMillan theory,[22] the electron-phonon coupling is given by

\[\lambda_{el-ph}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{*}\ln(\rho_{D}/1.45T_{c})}{(1-0.62\mu^{*})\ln( \rho_{D}/1.45T_{c})-1.04},\]

where the Coulomb pseudopotential \(\mu^{*}\) is usually between 0.1 and 0.15. Assuming \(\mu^{*}=0.13\), the electron-phonon coupling is estimated to be \(\lambda_{el-ph}\approx 0.51\), suggesting that YbSb\({}_{2}\) is a weakly coupled BCS superconductor. Moreover, the \(\lambda_{el-ph}\) value confirms the effective electron mass \(m^{*}\) as calculated using \(m^{*}=(1+\lambda_{el-ph})m_{0}\), which gives \(m^{*}=1.51m_{0}\).

Figure 8 shows frequency \(\Delta f(T)\sim\chi(T)\) measured for a \(0.7\times 0.5\times 0.3\) mm\({}^{3}\) sample. Data above \(T_{c}\) represent a combination of magnetic and resistive responses in the normal state of YbSb\({}_{2}\). The skin depth at \(T=1.5\) K was estimated to be \(\delta\approx 8.9\ \mu\)m, which is much smaller than any dimension of the sample. The skin depth \(\delta\) was calculated with the residual resistivity \(\rho_{0}=0.53\ \mu\Omega\) cm and an operating frequency of 16 MHz. A slight upturn before the superconducting transition can be attributed to the response of some paramagnetic impurities. \(T_{c}\) was determined as the temperature where \(\Delta f(T)\) deviates from the normal-state behavior.

In the pure Meissner state (Fig. 8), for \(H_{\rm dc}=0\), both ZFC and FC curves coincide. Additionally, apart from the superconducting transition, a small feature near 0.11 K was observed, as shown in the inset. This may be attributed to a phase associated with extrinsic magnetic impurities. In Fig. 9, the calculated superfluid density, \(\rho=\lambda^{2}(0)/\lambda^{2}(T)\), is found to be consistent with a single-gap \(s\)-wave pairing in YbSb\({}_{2}\), except for the impurity contribution which modifies the curve at the lowest temperatures. In the presence of magnetic impurities with magnetic permeability \(\mu(T)\), the actual measured penetration depth is renormalized as \(\lambda_{m}=\sqrt{\mu(T)}\lambda\), so that the experimentally constructed superfluid density is

  given by \(\rho_{m}=\lambda^{2}(0)/[\mu(T)\lambda^{2}(T)]\). For paramagnetic impurities behaving following the Curie law, this renormalization leads to a downward trend of \(\rho_{m}\) in the region where real superfluid density is already flat. At higher temperatures the contribution of paramagnetic impurities rapidly vanishes since \(\mu=1+4\pi\,\chi=1+C/T\), where \(C\) is the Curie constant.

In nonzero magnetic field, ZFC-FC \(\Delta f\) curves (Fig. 8) show hysteresis up to \(H=50\) Oe. Interestingly, the FC data indicate stronger repulsion below an intermediate temperature, marked with solid triangles, which systematically decreases with increasing \(H\). This crossover no longer exists above 40 Oe, and ZFC data recover stronger repulsion. Above 70 Oe, which is greater than \(H_{c}\) determined by various thermodynamic measurements, data still show a diamagnetic response without hysteresis, which persists up to 400 Oe. It should also be noted that the ac susceptibility for \(H=60\) Oe (Fig. 4) remains slightly diamagnetic after the DPE peak vanishes, consistent with the results displayed in Fig. 8. The origin of the diamagnetism above the bulk \(H_{c}\) is not clear; however, the \(H\)-\(T\) phase diagram shown in Fig. 10 is reminiscent of a field-dependent pairing state with multiple order parameters in the heavy-fermion superconductor PrOs\({}_{4}\)Sb\({}_{12}\).[23, 24] More detailed measurements are required to fully understand the rich physics of this unconventional behavior and to clarify whether this could be bulk or surface superconductivity.

The relationship between \(T_{c}\) and \(H_{c}\) is summarized in the \(H\)-\(T\) phase diagram (Fig. 10). The \(H_{c}\) values determined from \(\chi^{\prime}(T)\) (squares), \(\chi^{\prime}(H)\) (triangles), \(C_{p}\) (diamonds), and \(\Delta f\) (circles) below \(\sim\)80 Oe can be fit to the expected BCS temperature dependence \(H_{c}(T)=H_{c}(0)[1-(T/T_{c})^{2}]\) (solid line, Fig. 10 inset). This gives \(H_{c}(0)=55\) Oe and \(T_{c}=1.30\) K. The possible new superconducting state inferred from the rf magnetization (Fig. 8) can also be described with a similar equation, \(H_{c}^{(2)}(T)=H_{c}^{(2)}(0)[1-(T/T_{c}^{(2)})^{2}]\) (dashed line, Fig. 10), which gives \(H_{c}^{(2)}(0)=430\) Oe and \(T_{c}^{(2)}=0.41\) K.

The superconducting and thermodynamic parameters of YbSb\({}_{2}\) are summarized in Table 1. Several traits of type-I superconductors have been observed in this compound, including a small GL parameter \(\kappa=0.05\), a typical shape of the dc \(M(H)\) isotherms (Fig. 2), a strong DPE signal in the ac magnetization (Fig. 5), small critical field values, and a change from second- to first-order phase transition induced by magnetic field and visible in specific heat data (Fig. 6). All these observations provide proof of the type-I superconductivity in YbSb\({}_{2}\). In addition, a possible second superconducting state at lower temperatures is observed in rf magnetization (Fig. 8), which reveals unconventional behavior, as of yet not fully understood. This calls for more experiments to elucidate the underlying physics in YbSb\({}_{2}\).
