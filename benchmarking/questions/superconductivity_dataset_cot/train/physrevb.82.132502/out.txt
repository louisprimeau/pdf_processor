###### Abstract

The dependence of the superconducting transition temperature _T_c of CaC6 has been determined as a function of hydrostatic pressure in both helium-loaded gas and diamond-anvil cells to 0.6 GPa and 32 GPa, respectively. Following an initial increase at the rate +0.39(1) K/GPa, _T_c drops abruptly from 15 to 4 K at \sim10 GPa. Between 18 and 32 GPa, no superconducting transition is observed above 2 K.

## I Introduction

The s,_p_-electron metal CaC6 possesses with _T_c = 11.5 K the highest superconducting transition temperature of all known graphite-related compounds.[1, 2] Magnetic susceptibility measurements by two separate groups have shown that _T_c increases under pressure at the rate \sim +0.50(5) K/GPa (to 1.2 GPa) (Ref. [3]) or +0.42 to +0.48 K/GPa (to 1.6 GPa),[4] where the pressure medium used was, respectively, kerosene or silicone oil. This relatively large positive value of the initial slope _dTc_/_dP_ stands in contrast to the negative dependence normally found in those s,_p_-electron metals which superconduct at ambient pressure.[5] An electrical resistivity study on CaC6 to 16 GPa using Fluorinert pressure medium reported that _T_c initially increases under pressure at the rate \sim+0.5 K/GPa, reaching a maximum value of 15.1 K before dropping abruptly at 8 GPa to \sim5 K, apparently due to a first-order structural phase transition.[6] Recent room-temperature synchrotron x-ray diffraction studies to 13 GPa using helium or argon pressure media report the onset of reversible peak broadening above 9 GPa which is interpreted as giving evidence for an unusual order-disorder phase transformation with no change in space-group symmetry from R\overline{3}m rhombohedral.[7] Further _T_c(_P_) studies to higher more nearly hydrostatic pressures would clearly be useful to establish whether or not the abrupt drop in _T_c near 8 GPa is an intrinsic effect or possibly induced through shear stresses from the solid pressure medium. Dense He is the most nearly hydrostatic pressure medium available in experiments at low temperatures.

In the present work, the pressure dependence of _T_c for CaC6 is studied in a susceptibility measurements both in a He-gas pressure system to 0.6 GPa and in a diamond-anvil-cell (DAC) to 32 GPa utilizing dense He pressure medium. Following an initial increase under pressure to 15 K at the rate +0.39(1) K/GPa, a sharp drop in _T_c from 15 to \sim4 K is observed at 10 GPa.

## II Experimental

CaC6 samples are prepared using the alloy method described by Emery _et al.[2]_ A stainless steel tube is cleaned, baked at 900 degC in vacuum, and loaded with lithium and calcium in the atomic ratio 3:1. Natural Madagascar graphite flakes or highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) pieces (GE ZYA grade) are added to the Li-Ca alloy. The tube is mechanically sealed in an argon atmosphere and placed inside a one-zone furnace which is evacuated to 2 x 10-7 Torr and subsequently filled with argon gas. The furnace is then heated to 350 degC and the reaction takes place for 10 days. After this time, the furnace is turned off allowing the sample to slowly cool down to room temperature. The tube is opened inside an argon-filled glove box and the samples, exhibiting a golden appearance, removed by dissolving the alloy in ethylenediamine (Sigma Aldrich >99%).

Figure 1 shows the x-ray diffraction data for a typical CaC6 flake sample with the (00l) diffraction peaks obtained using a Rigaku x-ray diffractometer with Cu _K_a radiation and taken in a Bragg-Brentano geometry.[8] The pattern is consistent with the rhombohedra structure model for CaC6 of Emery _et al.[2]_ No lines corresponding to hexagonal graphite are visible within our detection limits, showing the bulk nature of the sample. From the diffraction data, we find the lattice parameters a = 4.33 A and c = 13.57 A, yielding a mass density of 2.53 g/cm3.

For hydrostatic pressures to 0.6 GPa, a He-gas compressor system from Harwood Engineering was used in combi

 nation with a CuBe pressure cell from Unipress with a 7 mm diameter bore. Using a primary/secondary compensated coil system immediately surrounding the sample in the cell bore, ac susceptibility measurements at 0.1 Oe rms and 1023 Hz can be carried out under pressure to the same high accuracy as measurements at ambient pressure. A two-stage Balzers closed-cycle refrigerator was used to cool the pressure cell to below the superconducting transition temperature of CaC6; all measurements were carried out upon warming up slowly through the transition at the rate \sim0.06 K/min. All susceptibility measurements were repeated at least once to verify that the transition temperature at a given pressure was reproducible to within 20 mK. T_{c} is determined from the transition midpoint in the ac susceptibility.

The membrane-driven DAC (Ref. [9]) in this experiment employed 1/6-cart type Ia diamond anvils with 0.5 mm cutlets and a 3 mm girdle. After the nonsuperconducting, nonmagnetic NiMo-alloy gasket was preindented from 380 \mum to 80 \mum, a 235 \mum hole was spark-cut through the center. Tiny ruby spheres [10] are placed on or near the sample to allow the pressure determination at a temperature near 20 K using the revised ruby calibration of Chijioke _et al._[11] The ac susceptibility in the DAC is measured using two compensated primary/secondary coil systems with an applied field of 3 Oe rms at 1023 Hz. Further details of the DAC (Refs. [9] and [12]) and He-gas compressor [13] techniques are given elsewhere.

## III Results and discussion

In Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), the diamagnetic transition to superconductivity for both CaC6 samples is seen to shift to higher temperatures with increasing hydrostatic pressure. The size of the superconducting shielding is more than twice as large for the HOPG-graphite sample as for the natural graphite sample. In Fig. 3, the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} is plotted versus pressure for both samples. [14] The measured T_{c}(P) dependence is seen to be reversible and not depend on the temperature at which the pressure is changed. Within experimental error, the rate of increase, dT_{c}/dP\approx +0.40(1) K/GPa, is the same for both samples but 5-10 % less than that reported previously in experiments where less hydrostatic pressure media were used. [3, 4, 6]

The results of the present ac susceptibility experiments on the HOPG graphite CaC6 sample in a DAC are shown in Fig. 4. Following the initial pressurization to \sim5 GPa at 2 K, the pressure was changed in the temperature range 100-150 K. The transition is seen to shift to higher temperatures with pressure to 9.5 GPa, but then to suddenly fall to 8 K at

  10.7 GPa and broaden. At 11.8 GPa T_{c} lies near 4 K and decreases moderately at higher pressures to 18.3 GPa. At higher pressures the transition shifted to temperatures below our temperature window and did not reappear to 32 GPa.

In Fig. 5, this dependence of T_{c} on pressure is shown explicitly and compared to the previous results of Gauzzi _et al._[6] to 18 GPa. In both measurements, T_{c} is seen to plummet downward rapidly at a pressure near 10 GPa, indicating a possible first-order phase transition. This possibility is supported by the sudden marked broadening of the transition at 10.7 GPa. The initial slope dT_{c}/dP  + 0.39(1) K/GPa to 9.5 GPa agrees well with the results of our He-gas studies to 0.6 GPa in Fig. 3.

In summary, the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature of CaC6 on nearly hydrostatic pressure has been studied to 32 GPa. Following an increase from 11 to 15 K under 9.5 GPa pressure, T_{c} abruptly drops to 4 K at 11.8 GPa. For pressures between 18 and 32 GPa, no superconducting transition is observed above 2 K. The present results are in reasonable agreement with the less hydrostatic studies of Gauzzi _et al._[6] to 18 GPa where the drop in T_{c} occurs at a slightly lower pressure. The T_{c}(P) dependence for CaC6 given in Fig. 5 is thus intrinsic and not the result of shear stress effects.
