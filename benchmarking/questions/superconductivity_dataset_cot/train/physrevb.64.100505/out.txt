###### Abstract

Surface impedance measurements of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C superconducting thin films as a function of temperature have been performed down to 1.5 K and at 20 GHz using a dielectric resonator technique. The magnetic penetration depth closely reproduces the standard BCS result, but with a reduced value of the energy gap at low temperature. These data provide evidence for an anisotropic _s_-wave character of the order parameter symmetry in LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. From the evaluation of the real part of complex conductivity, we have observed constructive (type II) coherence effects in the electromagneetic absorption below T_{c}.

The rare earth R borocarbides with the generic formula _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C are believed to be BCS-type superconductors. They have a moderately large density of states at the Fermi level, and it is generally agreed that the electron-phonon interaction is indeed the underlying mechanism for superconductivity.[1]

The members of this family are either antiferromagnetic or nonmagnetic at low temperatures. Nonmagnetic compounds with R = Y and Lu exhibit fairly high T_{c} values of about 15-16 K. Magnetism coexists with superconductivity for R = Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm, whereas only antiferromagnetic order occurs for R = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, and Tb. The antiferromagnetic ordering, and its competition (and even coexistence) with superconductivity, is conjectured to be driven by a nesting feature in the Fermi surface (FS).[2] In the Lu compound, the 4f band is fully occupied and therefore it is not magnetic. Since the f electrons occupy localized corelike states, the Fermi surface is expected to be similar to that of the other compounds.

A study of the Y and Lu compounds is therefore a prerequisite for the understanding of their magnetic counterparts, since they are free from the complications introduced by the presence of magnetism, and ideal for investigating the origin of superconductivity in borocarbides.

Even if, from the available experimental data, a dominating electron-phonon mediated mechanism seems to be a quite natural assumption, still there are a number of interesting properties that are not fully clarified. Among them, the unusual temperature and field dependence of the electronic specific heat[3] and the upward curvature of _H__{c2}(_T_) data close to T_{c}.[4] During the years, these anomalies have been interpreted by different authors as hints for unconventional (_d_-wave) superconductivity.[5] Pair-breaking effects caused by localized magnetic moments have been also invoked to explain the unusual temperature dependence of the upper critical field.[6] The presence of magnetic scattering is predicted to have an impact also on the low-temperature behavior of penetration depth \lambda of these compounds.

With the aim of shedding light on the origin of such anomalies, we report here on precise measurements of the microwave surface impedance of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C superconducting thin films, performed at 20 GHz by means of a sapphire dielectric resonator. The focus of this study is mainly on the temperature behavior of the magnetic penetration depth. It is well known in fact that \lambda(_T_) at low temperatures may be used as a very sensitive probe of the symmetry of the order parameter.[7]

Very few microwave measurements have been performed since now on borocarbides, and only on the R = Y, Er, Tm, and Ho compounds of the family, leading to controversial results. Antiferromagnetic transitions at zero field were not always seen, but anomalies in the low-temperature surface impedance were clearly observed for ErNi_{2}B_{2}C, HoNi_{2}B_{2}C, and TmNi_{2}B_{2}C.[8] The temperature dependence of the penetration depth of YNi_{2}B_{2}C was found to disagree[8] or to be consistent with BCS expectations.[9] Results found for ErNi_{2}B_{2}C thin films supported a view where magnetic pair-breaking affects the superconducting density of states.[9]

LuNi_{2}B_{2}C thin films are synthesized by a dc magnetron sputtering technique in ultrahigh vacuum from a stoichiometric 5-cm-diameter target prepared by arc-melting. Samples have been deposited on different substrates, with best results obtained using single-crystal (100) MgO. In the following, however, we will report on films grown on single-crystal sapphire 10\times10\times0.5-mm^{3} substrates, because of their lowest microwave dielectric losses. Details of the procedure have been already reported elsewhere.[10] Four-point resistivity probe indicates a resistivity p of the order of 100 \muL cm or larger, a residual resistivity ratio _r__{R}= _r_(300 K)/_r_(_T_)_{c}\sim3, a critical temperature T_{c} of about 15 K, \Delta T_{c} (90-10 %) values ranging between 0.4 and 0.8 K. Inductive measurements show _T__{c} values slightly (about 0.5 K) lower, but with similar transition widths. Structural characterization by a standard x-ray diffractometry shows a single phase growth with predominant _c_-axis orientation normal to the substrate plane. _th_2 _th_ spectra evidence also the presence of a small percentage of Lu_{2}O_{3} oxide phase. Rocking curve measurement of the (002) peak gives a FWHM\sim 1.4deg.

We have performed measurements of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda and surface resistance R_{s} as a function of temperature on two optimized samples. Each sample consists of two films, 300 nm thick, produced in the same deposition run, having therefore nominally the same structural, trans  port, and superconducting properties. In the following, we will show the results of measurements undertaken on the best of the two samples from T_{c} down to 1.5 K. Data for the second sample follow a similar behavior.

The surface impedance Z_{x} = R_{x} + JX_{x} = R_{x} + j\mu_{0}\omega, where \omega is the angular frequency, is investigated by means of a dielectrically loaded cylindrical resonator [11] operating at 20 GHz. The TE011 field is excited and detected by two semifigroid coaxial cables, each having a small loop at the end, and the resonant frequency f and Q factor are measured in the transmission mode and in unloaded condition. In the inset of Fig. 1, a schematic drawing of the experimental setup is presented.

In Fig. 1 the penetration depth data, extracted from the resonant frequency measurements, are displayed as a function of temperature. The data are fitted to the BCS theory, using the Halbritter code, [12] shown as a continuous curve in the graph. The coherence length \xi_{0}, the critical temperature T_{c}, and the mean free path l are set as input values, taken either from literature (\xi_{0}) or from transport measurements (T_{c} and resistivity \rho), and the London penetration depth at zero temperature \lambda_{L}(0) is extracted from the numerical fit. The strong coupling ratio 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} is taken to be the BCS value 3.5, consistent with previous findings. [13] All the parameters are reported in Table 1. Data agree well with expectations for a weak-coupled s-wave superconductor, but at the lowest temperatures they show a significant discrepancy. This is more clearly displayed in Fig. 2, where the quantity \Delta\lambda(T) = \lambda(T) - \lambda(0) is plotted as a function of temperature for T/T_{c}<0.5. The BCS curve using parameters taken from Table 1 is represented by the continuous line; in this graph, experimental points start to depart from the zero temperature value, and from the BCS expectations, already at T/T_{c}\approx0.15. One can see that a good agreement between theory and data can be achieved only using a reduced value of the energy gap, 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=2.0\pm 0.2 (dashed line). This is, to our understanding, striking evidence for the existence of a strongly anisotropic s-wave gap in the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C borocarbide. Indeed, in a band structure study Dugdale _et al._[14] showed experimentally a rather complicated Fermi surface for this compound, revealing the presence of a sheet capable of nesting. The observed anisotropy was consistent with the observation of a square flux-line lattice and the unusual upper critical field behavior reported in previous experiments. Recent photoemission experiments [15] in the parent compound YNi_{2}B_{2}C provided also spectroscopic evidence for an anisotropic s-wave gap. It is worthwhile to mention, however, that in our case the gap anisotropy, \Delta(0)_{\rm max}/\Delta(0)_{\rm min}\approx1.75, is more pronounced than results from other measurements: electronic Raman spectroscopy, [16] for example, shows a maximum anisotropy of 10%.

Of course, the presence of low-lying energy states at very low temperatures can be also related to other effects, like to somehow depressed superconductivity on the sample surface. However, since t\approx\Delta(0), what the surface impedance is probing here is actually the "bulk" electrodynamic response of the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C films.

For completeness, we have also analyzed the penetration depth data taking into account the effect of correlation between magnetic impurities at low temperature, which gives rise to a spin-flip scattering frustration as T goes to zero. [6] This is accomplished introducing a temperature-dependent magnetic scattering amplitude \Gamma(T) = \Gamma_{0}(1 + \beta T/\theta)/(1 + T/\theta), where \Gamma_{0} = \Gamma(0), \theta is a characteristic temperature describing the effects of correlation, \beta is a parameter describing the relative change in \Gamma caused by correlation. In this model \Delta strongly depends on T even in the low

Continuous and dashed lines represent the fit using the BCS theory and \Delta(0) = 2.1 and 1.2 meV, respectively, the dot-dashed line is the result assuming the presence of correlated magnetic impurities (see text), the dotted curve expresses the quadratic dependence expected from a dirty d-wave model.

  temperature region, since the decrease in the effectiveness of pair breaking translates in an increase of the pairing amplitude ("recovery" effect). The combined effect of \Delta(T) and \Gamma(T) rises rise to an almost linear dependence of the magnetic penetration depth near T\!=\!0 K, displayed as a dot-dashed line in Fig. 2. Using the specific values of parameters \beta, \theta, and \Gamma_{0} taken from Ref. [6], one can see that the model prediction can be hardly reconciled with the experimental data.

It has been recently proposed an interpretation of a number of unusual features presented by borocarbides in terms of a three-dimensional version of d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} superconductivity. The experimentally observed saturation of the penetration depth at the lowest temperature however argues strongly against the possibility of nodes in the gap function of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. For the sake of comparison, in Fig. 2 we have also plotted the quadratic dependence expected for a dirty d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} superconductor (dotted line).[17]

From quality factor measurements we have also obtained the surface resistance value as a function of temperature. Assuming the usual f^{2} scaling, the comparison of the measured R_{s} with previous results on both single crystals and thin films of parent compounds evidences values that are between one and two orders of magnitude lower. Owing also to the good structural and surface quality of our samples, this makes us confident that the observed microwave dissipation is mainly intrinsic in origin. In spite of this, data cannot be consistently fitted in the overall temperature range within a BCS framework using the same parameters shown in Table 1, since the level of losses is still too high. Surface impurities and other structural imperfections may of course affect the surface resistance in various ways. We speculate however that the observed losses may be an evidence of an unusual number of "unpaired" charge carriers arising from the same sheet in the FS that is responsible for the anisotropy. Indeed, for T less than T_{c}/2 the surface resistance behavior can be described using the standard BCS exponential dependence

\[R_{s}\!-\!R_{\rm res}^{m}A\sqrt{\Delta/k_{B}T}e^{-\Delta/k_{B}T}.\] (1)

where R_{\rm res} is the residual surface resistance and A is a phenomenological parameter. The value found for the ratio 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} lies between 1.5 and 1.8, depending mainly on the value chosen for the constant term R_{\rm res}, in fair agreement therefore with penetration depth results at low temperatures. In Fig. 3 the quantity R_{s}-R_{\rm res} is displayed, together with the low-temperature BCS fit [2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\!=\!1.6]. In this picture, losses can be ascribed to the existence of remnant scattering states due to the anisotropy in the energy gap or to the presence of strong electron-electron scattering in the nested regions of the FS.[18]

From the surface resistance and magnetic penetration depth data, it is then possible to extract the temperature dependence of the complex conductivity \sigma\!=\!\sigma_{1}\!-\!j\sigma_{2}.[19] Since X_{s}\!\gg\!R_{s} in almost all the temperature range, \sigma_{2}\approx\!(\mu_{0}\omega\Delta^{2})^{-1} retaining of course the BCS functional dependence observed for the magnetic penetration depth. \sigma_{1} first starts to increase below the critical temperature, reaching a broad maximum at about 0.8T_{c}, and then decreases to a constant value at low temperatures. Subtracting in the analysis of the data the residual value R_{\rm res} found from the fit of surface resistance, one can force the real part of conductivity to reach a zero value at T\!=\!0 K, which is equivalent to forcing the quasiparticle contribution to approach zero with decreasing temperature (Fig. 4). This procedure, however, does not change the nonmonotonous dependence displayed by the \sigma_{1}(T) data. The increase in the real part of conductivity below T_{c} has to be related to the development of a singularity in the density of states at the gap edge, which leads therefore to the observation of a type-II coherence (Hebel-Slichter) peak.

The experimental results are in good agreement with the dirty limit (I\!\ll\!\xi_{0})BCS weak-coupling theory. Indeed, in Fig. 4 we have compared the conductivity data with the BCS expectation (dotted line) computed using a modified two-fluid model[20] and the standard 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\!=\!3.5 ratio. In spite of the observed discrepancy at very high and very low

Figure 3: Temperature dependence of the BCS contribution to the surface resistance R_{s}\!-\!R_{\rm res} at 20 GHz, and fit to the BCS theory (dotted line) at low temperature with a reduced gap value [\Delta(0)=\!1.0 meV].

  temperature (the model loses accuracy close to T_{c} , and as T goes to zero in our data the energy gap is reduced), the agreement between the curve and measurements, in terms of position and intensity of the coherence peak, is remarkable.

Most NMR studies till now reported the absence of the Hebel-Slichter peak.[21] To our knowledge, to date there is only one report from a ^{13}C NMR study of YNi_{2}B_{2}C polycrystalline samples where a small enhancement in the spin-lattice relaxation time temperature dependence just below T_{c} has been observed.[22]

In conclusion, data taken from surface impedance measurements of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C superconducting thin films show the following:

* The full consistency with a conventional s-wave phonon mediated framework. No evidence of d-wave symmetry has been found, nor magnetic impurity correlation effects have been proved to describe our experimental findings.
* The existence of a strong anisotropy in the energy gap, revealing itself in the low-temperature dependence of both the real and imaginary part of Z_{s}. This is a strong support to a common view[14, 15, 23] that most unusual features observed in borocarbides may be related to the presence of deep minima in the gap function.
* The evidence of a clear peak in the \sigma_{1}(T) dependence below T_{c} to be associated with type-II coherence effects in the electromagnetic absorption. This is a further direct confirmation that LuNi_{2}B_{2}C behaves as a conventional BCS s-wave superconductor.

The surface impedance Z_{x} = R_{x} + JX_{x} = R_{x} + j\mu_{0}\omega, where \omega is the angular frequency, is investigated by means of a dielectrically loaded cylindrical resonator [11] operating at 20 GHz. The TE011 field is excited and detected by two semifigroid coaxial cables, each having a small loop at the end, and the resonant frequency f and Q factor are measured in the transmission mode and in unloaded condition. In the inset of Fig. 1, a schematic drawing of the experimental setup is presented.

In Fig. 1 the penetration depth data, extracted from the resonant frequency measurements, are displayed as a function of temperature. The data are fitted to the BCS theory, using the Halbritter code, [12] shown as a continuous curve in the graph. The coherence length \xi_{0}, the critical temperature T_{c}, and the mean free path l are set as input values, taken either from literature (\xi_{0}) or from transport measurements (T_{c} and resistivity \rho), and the London penetration depth at zero temperature \lambda_{L}(0) is extracted from the numerical fit. The strong coupling ratio 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} is taken to be the BCS value 3.5, consistent with previous findings. [13] All the parameters are reported in Table 1. Data agree well with expectations for a weak-coupled s-wave superconductor, but at the lowest temperatures they show a significant discrepancy. This is more clearly displayed in Fig. 2, where the quantity \Delta\lambda(T) = \lambda(T) - \lambda(0) is plotted as a function of temperature for T/T_{c}<0.5. The BCS curve using parameters taken from Table 1 is represented by the continuous line; in this graph, experimental points start to depart from the zero temperature value, and from the BCS expectations, already at T/T_{c}\approx0.15. One can see that a good agreement between theory and data can be achieved only using a reduced value of the energy gap, 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=2.0\pm 0.2 (dashed line). This is, to our understanding, striking evidence for the existence of a strongly anisotropic s-wave gap in the LuNi_{2}B_{2}C borocarbide. Indeed, in a band structure study Dugdale _et al._[14] showed experimentally a rather complicated Fermi surface for this compound, revealing the presence of a sheet capable of nesting. The observed anisotropy was consistent with the observation of a square flux-line lattice and the unusual upper critical field behavior reported in previous experiments.

It is worthwhile to mention, however, that in our case the gap anisotropy, \Delta(0)_{\rm max}/\Delta(0)_{\rm min}\approx1.75, is more pronounced than results from other measurements: electronic Raman spectroscopy, [16] for example, shows a maximum anisotropy of 10%.

[6] This is accomplished introducing a temperature-dependent magnetic scattering amplitude \Gamma(T) = \Gamma_{0}(1 + \beta T/\theta)/(1 + T/\theta), where \Gamma_{0} = \Gamma(0), \theta is a characteristic temperature describing the effects of correlation, \beta is a parameter describing the relative change in \Gamma caused by correlation. In this model \Delta strongly depends on T even in the low

The combined effect of \Delta(T) and \Gamma(T) rises rise to an almost linear dependence of the magnetic penetration depth near T\!=\!0 K, displayed as a dot-dashed line in Fig. 2. Using the specific values of parameters \beta, \theta, and \Gamma_{0} taken from Ref. [6], one can see that the model prediction can be hardly reconciled with the experimental data.

It has been recently proposed an interpretation of a number of unusual features presented by borocarbides in terms of a three-dimensional version of d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} superconductivity. The experimentally observed saturation of the penetration depth at the lowest temperature however argues strongly against the possibility of nodes in the gap function of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C. For the sake of comparison, in Fig. 2 we have also plotted the quadratic dependence expected for a dirty d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} superconductor (dotted line).[17]

From quality factor measurements we have also obtained the surface resistance value as a function of temperature. Assuming the usual f^{2} scaling, the comparison of the measured R_{s} with previous results on both single crystals and thin films of parent compounds evidences values that are between one and two orders of magnitude lower. Owing also to the good structural and surface quality of our samples, this makes us confident that the observed microwave dissipation is mainly intrinsic in origin. In spite of this, data cannot be consistently fitted in the overall temperature range within a BCS framework using the same parameters shown in Table 1, since the level of losses is still too high. Surface impurities and other structural imperfections may of course affect the surface resistance in various ways. We speculate however that the observed losses may be an evidence of an unusual number of "unpaired" charge carriers arising from the same sheet in the FS that is responsible for the anisotropy. Indeed, for T less than T_{c}/2 the surface resistance behavior can be described using the standard BCS exponential dependence

\[R_{s}\!-\!R_{\rm res}^{m}A\sqrt{\Delta/k_{B}T}e^{-\Delta/k_{B}T}.\] (1)

where R_{\rm res} is the residual surface resistance and A is a phenomenological parameter. The value found for the ratio 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} lies between 1.5 and 1.8, depending mainly on the value chosen for the constant term R_{\rm res}, in fair agreement therefore with penetration depth results at low temperatures. In Fig. 3 the quantity R_{s}-R_{\rm res} is displayed, together with the low-temperature BCS fit [2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\!=\!1.6]. In this picture, losses can be ascribed to the existence of remnant scattering states due to the anisotropy in the energy gap or to the presence of strong electron-electron scattering in the nested regions of the FS.[18]

From the surface resistance and magnetic penetration depth data, it is then possible to extract the temperature dependence of the complex conductivity \sigma\!=\!\sigma_{1}\!-\!j\sigma_{2}.[19] Since X_{s}\!\gg\!R_{s} in almost all the temperature range, \sigma_{2}\approx\!(\mu_{0}\omega\Delta^{2})^{-1} retaining of course the BCS functional dependence observed for the magnetic penetration depth. \sigma_{1} first starts to increase below the critical temperature, reaching a broad maximum at about 0.8T_{c}, and then decreases to a constant value at low temperatures. Subtracting in the analysis of the data the residual value R_{\rm res} found from the fit of surface resistance, one can force the real part of conductivity to reach a zero value at T\!=\!0 K, which is equivalent to forcing the quasiparticle contribution to approach zero with decreasing temperature (Fig. 4). This procedure, however, does not change the nonmonotonous dependence displayed by the \sigma_{1}(T) data. The increase in the real part of conductivity below T_{c} has to be related to the development of a singularity in the density of states at the gap edge, which leads therefore to the observation of a type-II coherence (Hebel-Slichter) peak.

The experimental results are in good agreement with the dirty limit (I\!\ll\!\xi_{0})BCS weak-coupling theory. Indeed, in Fig. 4 we have compared the conductivity data with the BCS expectation (dotted line) computed using a modified two-fluid model[20] and the standard 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\!=\!3.5 ratio. In spite of the observed discrepancy at very high and very low

Figure 3: Temperature dependence of the BCS contribution to the surface resistance R_{s}\!-\!R_{\rm res} at 20 GHz, and fit to the BCS theory (dotted line) at low temperature with a reduced gap value [\Delta(0)=\!1.0 meV].

  temperature (the model loses accuracy close to T_{c} , and as T goes to zero in our data the energy gap is reduced), the agreement between the curve and measurements, in terms of position and intensity of the coherence peak, is remarkable.

Most NMR studies till now reported the absence of the Hebel-Slichter peak.[21] To our knowledge, to date there is only one report from a ^{13}C NMR study of YNi_{2}B_{2}C polycrystalline samples where a small enhancement in the spin-lattice relaxation time temperature dependence just below T_{c} has been observed.[22]

In conclusion, data taken from surface impedance measurements of LuNi_{2}B_{2}C superconducting thin films show the following:

* The full consistency with a conventional s-wave phonon mediated framework. No evidence of d-wave symmetry has been found, nor magnetic impurity correlation effects have been proved to describe our experimental findings.
* The existence of a strong anisotropy in the energy gap, revealing itself in the low-temperature dependence of both the real and imaginary part of Z_{s}. This is a strong support to a common view[14, 15, 23] that most unusual features observed in borocarbides may be related to the presence of deep minima in the gap function.
* The evidence of a clear peak in the \sigma_{1}(T) dependence below T_{c} to be associated with type-II coherence effects in the electromagnetic absorption. This is a further direct confirmation that LuNi_{2}B_{2}C behaves as a conventional BCS s-wave superconductor.
