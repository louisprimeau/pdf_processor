###### Abstract

The penetration depth \(\lambda\) has been deduced from the reversible magnetization of three HgBa2CuO4+_d_ samples with doping _d_'s at and near the optimal value of 0.22. The obtained superfluid density \(n_{s}{\propto}1/\lambda^{2}\) at temperature \(T\) follows a parabolic law [\(1-(T/T_{c})^{2}\)] for the underdoped sample below _Tc_ over the entire temperature region examined, where _Tc_ is the superconducting transition temperature. However, \(n_{s}\) depends on \(T\) linearly for the optimally doped and slightly overdoped samples below 0.5 _Tc_. The observation suggests that \(\lambda(T)\) of cuprate superconductors depends on oxidation in a rather complicated fashion and the interpretation of \(\lambda(T)\) in terms of the superconducting pairing symmetry should be taken with care.

The temperature dependence of the in-plane penetration depth \(\lambda(T)\) of a high-temperature superconductor (HTS) has recently attracted great attention, in an attempt to determine the pairing symmetry of a HTS. This is because \(\lambda(T)\) is related to the superfluid density \(n_{s}\) as \(n_{s}{\propto}1/\lambda^{2}(T)\) and the temperature dependence of \(n_{s}\) is determined by the superconducting energy gap \(\Delta(T)\) and thus the pairing symmetry of a superconductor. At high temperatures, e.g., above 0.5 _Tc_, \(\Delta/T\) is small and can easily be affected or even dominated by other factors such as the superconducting coupling strength, carrier scattering, and the shape of the Fermi surface. The \(T\) dependence of \(\lambda\) consequently may vary greatly in this high-temperature region,1-3 e.g., 1/\(\lambda^{2}(T){\propto}(1-t^{\alpha})\) with \(\alpha\) ranging from 2 to 4, regardless of the pairing symmetry, where \(t\) = _T_/_Tc_. However, at low temperature of \(t\) <=0.5 where \(\Delta/T\) is large, \(\lambda(T)\) appears to be a good measure of the low-lying excitations and, hence, the pairing symmetry in a superconductor. According to the BCS theory, \(\lambda(T)\) of an _s_-wave superconductor depends on \(T\) exponentially and is given4 by

\[\lambda(T){\sim}\lambda(0)[1-3.3(T_{c}/T)^{1/2}{\exp}(-\Delta_{0}/T)]\]

or

\[\Delta\lambda(T){\equiv}\lambda(T)-\lambda(0){\sim}-3.3\lambda(0)(T_{c}/T)^{1/2}{\exp}(-\Delta_{0}/T)\]

if \(\Delta_{0}/T{\gg}1\), where \(\lambda(0)\) is \(\lambda(T)\) at 0 K and \(\Delta_{0}\) is the smallest value of \(\Delta\) over the Fermi surface at 0 K. On the other hand, \(\Delta\lambda(T){\propto}T\) at low temperatures has been predicted5 for a _d_-wave superconductor; where nodes or lines of nodes exist in the gap.

Different _T_-dependent \(\Delta\lambda\)'s on high quality YBa2CuO4 samples with similar _Tc_ ranging from linear6 to quadratic7 and even to exponential8 have been reported. The difference has been attributed either to possible impurity scattering9 which turns the linear \(T\) dependence characteristic of a _d_-wave superconductor to a quadratic \(T\) dependence, or possible proximity effects8 which gives rise to a quasilinear \(T\) dependence in an _s_-wave superconductor. The effect of strong resonant scattering on \(\lambda(T)\) of a _d_-wave superconductor has been examined theoretically.10 It has been suggested10 that \(\Delta\lambda{\propto}T^{\alpha}\) where \(\alpha{=}1\) for \(T^{\ast}{<}T{\ll}T_{c}\) and \(\alpha{=}2\) for \(T{<}T^{\ast}\), where \(T^{\ast}\) is the so-called crossover temperature and increases with the concentration of the resonant scattering centers. Almost all experiments reported were carried out on the nearly optimally doped YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ with maximum _Tc_. However, significant structural defects associated with a non-zero \(d\) and the proximity effect on the CuO chains may still exist without notable change of the maximum _Tc_. We have therefore investigated by magnetization measurements the oxygen-doping effect on \(\lambda(T)\) of HgBa2CuO4+_d_ with \(d\) at and near the optimal value of 0.22. Although the impurity scattering seems to be quite small in the nearly optimally doped Hg-based compounds11,12 and proximity effect is unlikely an issue in these compounds, we have observed an unambiguous variation of the \(T\) dependence of 1/\(\lambda^{2}\) along the _a_-_b_ plane with doping \(d\), i.e., 1/ \(\lambda^{2}{\propto}1-(T/T_{c})^{\alpha}\) with \(\alpha{=}2\) for the underdoped sample and \(\alpha{=}1\) for the optimally doped and the overdoped samples below 0.5 _Tc_. The observation cannot be understood in terms of the impurity scattering effect in a _d_-wave superconductor only,10 suggesting factors in addition to the pairing symmetry also influence \(\alpha\).

The polycrystalline samples of Hg1-_x_Ba2CuO4+_d_ studied were prepared by the solid/vapor reaction technique. Hg-deficiency appears to help achieve pure HgBa2CuO4+_d_ as indicated by x-ray diffractions. The oxygen content \(d\) of the samples was altered by heating the samples under different O2-partial pressures at \(\sim\)300 degC. Details have been published elsewhere.12 The magnetization (_M_) of the samples was measured at various temperatures as a function of field (_H_) during field increasing as well as field decreasing, employing a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Below the irreversibility line, the reversible \(M\) is taken as the average of the _M_'s measured during _H_-increasing (_M_+) and _H_-decreasing modes (_M_-), i.e., reversible \(M\) = (_M_+ + _M_-)/2.

It has been shown that HgBa2CuO4+_d_ exhibits a large _T_c variation through anion-doping with a minimum perturbation to the structural integrity.12 By increasing \(d\) from 0 to 0.4, _T_c can be altered parabolically from 0 K to its maximum value of 97 K at optimal doping d_ph_g_~0.22 and back to 20 K. The compound is known as underdoped when _d_<0.22 and overdoped when _d_>0.22. For the present study, we have chosen to examine three samples with _d_=0.16, 0.23, and 0.28, and _T_c's=88, 97, and 88 K, respectively. This is because of their high sample homogeneity as evident from their sharp transitions, and flat low field \(M\) determined in the field-cool (FC) mode below _T_c, as shown in Fig. 1 for the _d_=0.28 sample. Samples show a general broadening of the transition width and a less flat \(M\), presumably due to the inhomogeneous distribution of oxygen, as \(d\) moves further away from 0.22.

Four theoretical models have been used to extract \(l\) from the reversible \(M\). According to the London model,13 which considers only the electromagnetic energy in a type-II superconductor with \(H\) parallel to the \(c\) axis, _dM_/_d_ ln_H_ = _d_ph_/(32\(p\)32), where _ph_ is the flux quantum. By adding the free energy associated with the vortex cores to the London model, Hao and Clem14 obtained _dM_/_d_ ln_H_ = _d_ph_d_/(32\(p\)32), where \(b\) changes with \(H\) from ~0.7 for 0.1 <=_H_/_H_c20.3 to 0.84 for 0.02 <=_H_/_H_c20.1. Bulaevskii _et al._15 included the fluctuations effect and proposed _dM_/_d_ ln_H_ = _ph_d_/(32\(p\)32) - (_M_*/_T_*)_T_ for \(H\) above a crossover field, where _M_* and _T_* are determined by the crossing point of _M_(_T_)'s at different _H_'s. Near _T_c, \(l\) can also be deduced from the two-dimensional scaling as proposed by Tesanovic _et al._16 The values of 1/_l_ obtained from different models are shown as functions of temperature in Fig. 2(a) for the sample with _d_=0.28. The agreement between models appears to be good. Extending these models to lower temperature is debatable. However, the related uncertainty may not be significant at \(H\) <=5 T, since the free energy of vortex is mainly determined by the energy of the magnetic field.

Since _l_(_T_) is indirectly obtained in this study from _M_(_H_) at various _T_'s, there exist several possible sources of uncertainties in the determination of the \(T\) dependence of \(l\). They are effects of phase impurity, doping inhomogeneity, poly-crystallinity, irreversible magnetization, and paramagnetic

  background. Their contributions to the uncertainty of \(\uplambda(T)\) are assessed to be small and briefly summarized.

Nonmagnetic phase impurity will underestimate \(M\) and thus overestimate the absolute value of \(\uplambda\). Within the resolution of x-ray and neutron-power diffraction, our samples displayed a single phase of HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\)[12] although weight-balance and wet chemistry analyses showed a Hg deficiency. Since the three samples investigated were obtained by annealing similarly synthesized HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) under various O\({}_{2}\)-partial pressures, the overall systematic error introduced by phase impurity was estimated to be less than 5%. A doping inhomogeneity gives rise to a distribution of compounds with different \(T_{c}\)'s and thus can result in a false \(T\)-dependent \(\uplambda\). To minimize possible error associated with doping inhomogeneity, we chose samples with a narrow transition width and a \(T\)-independent \(M\) below \(T_{c}\) as shown in Fig. 1. The estimated error so introduced should be less than 5%. All theoretical models treat single crystalline samples with \(H\) parallel to the \(c\) axis. The samples examined were polycrystalline. Fortunately, it has been shown that the magnetization (\(M_{s}\)) of a single crystal HTS and that (\(M_{c}\)) of a polycrystalline one uniquely related as \(M_{s}(H)\) = 2\(M_{c}(\sqrt{e}H)\) provided the anisotropy \(\gamma\) of the HTS is greater than 5. Our preliminary results on aligned HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) powder suggest a \(\gamma\)\(\approx\)10 for the compound. This simple conversion was used for our analysis and should not lead to uncertainties in the \(T\) dependence of \(\uplambda\). An inhomogeneous field through which the sample moves in a SQUID magnetometer reduces the accuracy of \(M\) and hence \(\uplambda\). It was found to be very small and have an insignificant effect on our \(M\), as evidenced by the negligible \(M\) variation detected when the scanning length in the SQUID was changed from 2 to 6 cm.

HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) has a relatively high irreversibility line. The (\(H,T\)) region of interest to the present study often lies below the irreversibility line. The irreversible contribution to \(M\) can therefore be significant. Even for the granular samples of ours, the irreversible contribution to \(M\) of the optimally doped sample at 0.5 T was \(\sim\)10% at 40 K and increased to \(\sim\)25% at 20 K, although it was smaller for the other two samples. We have therefore determined the relaxation of the magnetization during \(H\)-increasing (\(M_{+}\)) and during \(H\)-decreasing (\(M_{-}\)) modes. We found that \(M_{+}\) and \(M_{-}\) relaxed toward their arithmetic average \(M\) = (\(M_{+}\) + \(M_{-}\))/2 at the same rate above 15 K and 1 T within a resolution of \(\pm\)10% as shown in Fig. 1 (inset). Even if in the surface-pinning dominated cases, the observed 0.9\(<\)(\(d\)\(M_{+}\)/\(d\)\(\ln\)r)/(\(d\)\(M_{-}\)/\(d\)\(\ln\)r)\(<\)1.1 will lead to the conclusion that the difference between the reversible \(M\) and (\(M_{+}\) + \(M_{-}\))/2 is 5% or less.[17] Consequently, we have used this averaged value as the reversible \(M\) for \(\uplambda(T)\) analysis and expect little error to be introduced to \(\uplambda(T)\).

A paramagnetic background \(M_{p}\) was detected in all of our samples above \(T_{c}\) for reasons yet-to-be determined. The paramagnetic background above \(T_{c}\) fits well the Curie-Weiss relation with a low Curie-temperature \(<\)3 K. For an underdoped sample with a \(T_{c}\)\(<\)4.2 K, the fit was excellent down to 30 K. However, at lower temperature and high field, \(M\) becomes \(H\) dependent and fits the Brillouin function \(M\) = \(a\)\(\tanh(bH/T)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are experimentally determined constants. The corrections on \(M\) below \(T_{c}\) were made by subtracting from the measured \(M\) the paramagnetic contribution extrapolated from the Curie-Weiss and Brillouin-function fits at different temperatures and fields. The estimated uncertainty associated with the paramagnetic background appears to be the largest among all possible sources listed above, and is shown in Fig. 2(a) as the crossed region, for example.

As a further check, we have compared the values of 1/\(\uplambda^{2}\), so obtained with those determined by \(\mu\)SR,[18] by using a conversion factor of (1/\(\uplambda^{2}\))/\(\sigma\)=11 \(\mu\)s \(\mu\)m\({}^{-2}\),[19] where \(\sigma\) is the depolarization rate in \(\mu\)SR measurements. As shown in Fig. 2(b) for the optimally doped sample, the \(T\) dependences of the two sets of data agree excellently. The agreement suggests that our method used to determine \(\uplambda(T)\) in the present study is unlikely to introduce large artifact to the \(T\) dependence of \(\uplambda\).

It is clear from Fig. 2 that 1/\(\uplambda^{2}(T)\) varies with \(T\) following a power law of 1 \(-\)(\(T/T_{c}\))\({}^{2}\) within our experimental uncertainty for the underdoped sample below \(T_{c}\). However, the observed data deviates from the square fit significantly below \(T_{c}\)/2. The difference seems to be larger than the possible uncertainties. A linear \(T\) dependence is clear below \(T_{c}\)/2 for both the optimally doped and overdoped samples. Unfortunately, the impurity scattering in the \(d\)-wave superconductors and the proximity effect may not be able to account for the observed change in the \(T\) dependence of 1/\(\uplambda^{2}(T)\). All three samples were obtained by annealing the same as-synthesized HgBa\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4+\delta}\) at \(\sim\)300 \({}^{\circ}\)C although at different oxygen partial pressures. Therefore, they should have similar structural imperfections except those induced by different \(\delta\)s which increases by a factor of approximately 2 from the underdoped to the overdoped samples. If one regards the randomly added oxygen as scattering centers, the change of \(\alpha\) from 2 to 1 with \(\delta\) increase contradicts the prediction of the defect models of the \(d\)-wave superconductors. The observation suggests that the carrier concentration can strongly affect the \(T\) dependence of 1/\(\uplambda^{2}\) in addition to impurity scattering. Similar observations have been made in \(\mu\)SR investigations before.[20] The interpretation of the \(T\) dependence of \(\uplambda\) in terms of the superconducting pairing symmetry should be taken with extreme care.
