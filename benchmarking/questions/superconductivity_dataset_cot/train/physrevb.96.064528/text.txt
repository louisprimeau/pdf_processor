## II Experiment

High-quality single crystals of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) were grown by chemical vapor transport method. The detailed process of synthesis was described in Ref. [18]. Magnetoresistance and the Hall effect measurements were performed by a standard four-probe lock-in technique in a Quantum Design PPMS at fields up to 9 Tesla in both positive and negative field polarities. Signal even (odd) in field was defined as magnetoresistance (Hall effect). For the hydrostatic pressure measurements, samples were loaded into a piston-type pressure cell and the actual pressure was determined by measuring the superconducting transition temperatures of Pb. Daphne 7373 oil was applied as the pressure transmission media. For the data under different pressures, the same contacts were used throughout the measurements such that the geometric errors in the contact size were identical for different runs.

To determine high-pressure structures, we used the evolutionary crystal structure prediction method USPEX [19-21]. Predictions were made from ambient pressure up to 60 GPa with a step of 5 GPa. Structure relaxations, enthalpy, and electron-phonon calculations were performed using the quantum-espresso[22] code with ultrasoft pseudopotential method and the plane-wave basis. The cutoffs were chosen as 30 Ry for the wave functions and 300 Ry for the charge density. The generalized-gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [23] was used for the exchange-correlation energy function. The electronic structure calculations with high accuracy for the stable structures were performed using the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FP-LAPW) method implemented in the wien2k code. [24] The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [23] was applied to the exchange-correlation potential calculation. The muffin tin radii were chosen to be 2.5 a.u. for Pb and Ta, and 2.37 a.u. for Se. The plane-wave cutoff was defined by \(RK_{\text{max}}=7.0\), where \(R\) is the minimum LAPW sphere radius and \(K_{\text{max}}\) is the plane-wave vector cutoff. Spin-orbit coupling was included in the calculations. To obtain the Fermi surface and surface state properties, a tight-binding model based on maximally localized Wannier functions [25] was constructed to reproduce the bulk band structure including spin-orbit coupling with Pb \(s\) and \(p\), Ta \(s\) and \(d\), and Se \(p\) orbitals. Then Fermi surfaces and surface state spectrum of (001) surface for each phase were calculated with the surface Green's function methods as implemented in wanniertools[26].

## III Results

Figure 1(a) illustrates \(\rho(T)\) profiles under various hydrostatic pressures (\(P\)). At ambient pressure, the \(T\) dependence of resistivity is typical of those reported in the literature [14-16]. Upon the application of a tiny pressure, e.g., 0.05 GPa, a sudden drop occurs around 286.5 K on the \(\rho(T)\) curve during the cooling process. When warming up, the corresponding resistivity anomaly slightly shifts to a higher temperature, resulting in a pronounced hysteresis. Similar resistivity hysteresis has recently been reported by Kaluarachchi _et al._, which was ascribed to a subtle structural modification from the high-\(T\)\(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) phase to the low-\(T\)\(P\bar{6}m2\) phase (see Fig. 5 for the corresponding structures). At ambient pressure, for example, with increasing \(T\), the room temperature \(\bar{P6}m2\) phase changes to \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\), which can be obtained by shifting the Pb atom from the 1a-Wyckoff coordinate in \(P\bar{6}m2\) to the 1e-Wyckoff position without changing its overall symmetry. According to Kaluarachchi _et al._, this structure transition takes place at 425 K under ambient pressure, i.e., a temperature higher than our measurements [17]. Compared with \(P\bar{6}m2\), the high-\(T\)\(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) phase displays an obvious contraction in the \(c\)-axis length while the \(a\) axis is slightly expanded [17]. Here, we define the structural transition temperature \(T_{s}\) as the average of the characteristic temperatures of the resistivity anomalies on the cooling and heating processes. With increasing pressure, \(T_{s}\) is found to be fast suppressed and disappears at \(P_{c}\sim 0.25\) GPa. Note that the data shown in Fig. 1 were taken in the pressure increasing process, however, the hysteresis was found to be reversible in the pressure decreasing process (data not shown for clarity).

In Fig. 1(b), a blowup of resistivity in the low-\(T\) regime clearly splits into two branches. At the low-pressure region

Figure 1: (a) Temperature dependence of resistivity under different pressures. (b) An enlarged view of the resistivity curves at low temperatures.

  with \(P\leqslant 0.21\) GPa, the sample shows sharp superconductivity with \(T_{c}\) around 3.9 K and \(T_{c}\) varies little with pressure. A notable suppression of \(T_{c}\) is clearly seen when \(P\) increases above 0.27 GPa. This suggests two superconducting phases are separated around \(P_{c}\sim 0.25\) GPa. It is worth noting, this critical pressure is the same as the pressure where the resistivity hysteresis disappears, implying that these two superconducting phases correspond to different crystal structures. Besides, the residual resistivity, defined as the resistivity at 5 K, also shows a sudden drop across this critical pressure.

To gain further insight into the underlying electronic changes across this critical pressure, the magnetoresistance and the Hall resistivity are studied, as shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. At low pressures, the field-dependent MR shows an interesting downward curvature, analogous to many recently discovered topological semimetals [27, 28]. With increasing \(P\), however, the size of MR is slightly reduced and the shape of MR becomes superlinear in field. Similar drastic changes across the critical pressure are also observable in the \(T\)-dependent Hall resistivity (\(\rho_{xy}\)) curves. When \(P\geqslant P_{c}\), the Hall resistivity is abruptly elevated, suggesting a pronounced change in the underlying electronic properties induced by the structural transition [29, 30].

Based on the above transport data, the pressure-dependent phase diagram is summarized in Fig. 3. In this phase diagram, two distinct superconducting phases separated by a structural transition are resolved. The quick residual resistivity drop, along with the abrupt changes in the magnetoresistance and the Hall effects, clearly indicates the remarkable change in the electronic properties across the phase boundary.

To clarify the nature of transition between these two superconducting phases, detailed enthalpy calculations for different crystal structures are performed. The resultant enthalpy-pressure (\(\Delta H\)-\(P\)) curves are plotted in Fig. 4, where the relative enthalpy differences \(\Delta H\) are calculated with respect to the \(P\bar{6}m2\) structure. We find that with increasing

In our measurements, we changed the polarity of the field and the even signal in field was defined as MR. The odd signal in field was determined as Hall resistivity \(\rho_{xy}\) as shown in (b).

  pressure, PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) undergoes two structural phase transitions, from the \(P\bar{6}m2\) to \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) structure at \(\sim\)5 GPa, then to the tetragonal \(P4/mmm\) structure at \(\sim\)30 GPa. Below 5 GPa, the most stable structure is the \(P\bar{6}m2\), which is the original phase found in experiment. As the pressure increases above \(\sim\)5 GPa, the \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) structure becomes more stable. Note that the \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) structure shares the same global symmetry with \(P\bar{6}m2\), with only the Pb atom shifting from the \(1a\) Wyckoff position (0, 0, 0) to the \(1e\) Wyckoff position (2/3, 1/3, 0) (see Fig. 5). At ambient conditions, the formation energy of the \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) structure is 48.2 meV (\(\sim\)500 K) per atom higher than of the \(P\bar{6}m2\) ground-state structure, the same energy scale as the structural transition around \(\sim\)425 K observed in the high-\(T\) XRD and TEM experiments [17]. Our calculations suggest that the resistivity hysteresis observed at low pressures is indeed associated with this subtle structural transition, in line with those reported by Kaluarachchi _et al._[17]. We also note that the critical pressure from the calculations (\(\sim\)5 GPa) is overestimated by a factor of 20 compared with the experimentally observed value (\(\sim\)0.25 GPa). This overestimation is an inherent issue in DFT calculations. At higher pressures, our study further predicted a new structural transition from \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) to the tetragonal structure with space group \(P4/mmm\) above 30 GPa, revealing a second structural phase transition under pressure.

It is intriguing to see how the electronic structure changes with these structural transitions. The calculated bulk band structures without and with SOC for different structures are shown in Fig. 5. Our results for the noncentrosymmetric hexagonal \(P\bar{6}m2\) [Figs. 5(d), 5(g)] are in good agreement with the previous reports [10, 11, 12, 18]. Large SOC splitting is clearly visible at the \(K\) and \(H\) points in the Brillouin zone for both Pb and Ta orbitals. The electronlike Pb \(p\) orbital and holelike Ta \(d\) orbital cross each other at the Fermi level, resulting in the nodal-line states at the \(K\) and \(H\) points, topologically protected by mirror reflection symmetry. Figures 5(e), 5(h) represent the band structure of \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) phase. The band structure is overall similar to that in the \(P\bar{6}m2\) except that the nodal-line states around the \(H\) point are completely destroyed. In this phase, nodal-line states at \(K\) point are partially gapped out by SOC. Figures 5(f), 5(i) delineate the band structure of \(P4/mmm\) phase, which is completely distinct from the above two phases. A band crossing exists at \(M\) point but with no band inversion [see Fig. 5(f)] and a gap is induced by SOC [see Fig. 5(i)], which suggests a topologically trivial phase in this high-pressure structure.

Figure 5: The schematic unit cell for (a) noncentrosymmetric hexagonal \(P\bar{6}m2\), (b) \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\), and (c) tetragonal \(P4/mmm\) phases. The band structures of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) calculated (d)–(f) without and (g)–(i) with SOC for three different structures. The weights of the Pb \(p\) and Ta \(d\) orbital contribution are color-coded by green and red, respectively. The rectangles in (g) indicate the DNL structure near \(K\) and \(H\) points. In (h), the DNL structure is gapped by SOC on the left-hand side of \(K\) but still intact on the right-hand side, indicated by the circles.

  The resultant bulk Fermi surfaces from scalar-relativistic calculations are shown in Figs. 6(a)-6(c) for \(P\bar{6}m2\), \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\), and \(P4/mmm\) phases, respectively. For the hexagonal phases \(P\bar{6}m2\) and \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\), there are two bands crossing the Fermi level. For \(P\bar{6}m2\), the Fermi surfaces consist of three parts: a disk-shaped hole pocket centered at \(\Gamma\), a hexagon-shaped electron pocket surrounding the disk-shaped pocket, and two nesting polygon cylinders at each corner of \(K\) points. The band analysis demonstrates that, distinct from the pockets surrounding \(\Gamma\), the cylinders at the corner are hybridized from electron and hole bands, and Pb-derived bands dominate the electron part (inner pocket) while Ta-derived bands dominate the holelike part (outer pocket). For \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\), the disk-shaped and hexagon-shaped pockets are nearly intact, while the cylinders at corner shrink and become more three dimensional, and reconstruct to two dumbbell-shaped pockets. For high-pressure tetragonal \(P4/mmm\) phase, three bands crossing the Fermi level construct a series of complicated three-dimensional Fermi surfaces: a cylinder centering at \(\Gamma\), and a clover-shaped pocket overlapping with a petal-shaped pocket surrounding \(M\) point at the corner.

We further calculate the surface band structures using a tight-binding model based on maximally localized Wannier functions [25, 26] constructed with Pb \(s\) and \(p\), Ta \(s\) and \(d\), and Se \(p\) orbitals. The surface bands are shown in Fig. 6(d)-6(f) for each phase. In \(P\bar{6}m2\) phase, due to the reflection symmetry, gap opening is forbidden at the crossing points, which results in a nodal ring structure. In \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) phase, Pb atom shifts from the \(1a\)-Wyckoff position (0, 0, 0) to the \(1e\)-Wyckoff position (2/3, 1/3, 0) without changing its reflection symmetry. As a result, the band structure and surface states around \(\bar{K}\) point are similar to those of the \(P\bar{6}m2\) phase. In contrast, for the

In \(P\bar{6}m2\) and \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\) phases, there are two bands crossing the Fermi level, which construct the Fermi surfaces, while three bands cross the Fermi level in the high-pressure \(P4/mmm\) phase. It is clear to see the Fermi surface nesting at the corners in the hexagonal phases, and the shape of these FSs changes from a cylinder to a dumbbell accompanied with the phase transition from \(P\bar{6}m2\) to \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\). The FS pockets at the corner become more three dimensional from \(P\bar{6}m2\) to \(P\bar{6}m2(1e)\).

  tetragonal \(P4/mmm\) phase, the surface band structure seems featureless, as plotted in Fig. 6(f).

In order to estimate the superconducting characteristics of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) under pressure, we performed linear response calculations [31] of its electron-phonon properties, and estimated the critical temperature through the Mc-Millan Allen-Dynes formula [32, 33]

\[T_{c}^{\rm Cal}=\frac{\omega_{\rm ln}}{1.2}\text{exp}\bigg{[}-\frac{1.04(1+ \lambda)}{\lambda-\mu^{*}(1+0.62\lambda)}\bigg{]},\] (1)

where \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) is the logarithmically averaged phonon frequency, and \(\mu^{*}\) is the Coulomb pseudopotential, which is set to be 0.1 in the calculations. We evaluate the pressure-dependent electron-phonon coupling constants \(\lambda\) and the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}^{\rm Cal}\) shown in Fig. 7. It is found that both \(\lambda\) and \(T_{c}^{\rm Cal}\) are maximal in \(P\delta m2\) phase at 0 GPa. Note that \(T_{c}^{\rm Cal}\) is twice the actual value of \(T_{c}\) observed in the experiments. As the pressure increases, both \(\lambda\) and \(T_{c}^{\rm Cal}\) decrease up to 30 GPa. For the \(P4/mmm\) phase, while the electron-phonon coupling constant slightly decreases with pressure, \(T_{c}^{\rm Cal}\) demonstrates a superconducting dome, reaching a maximum value of 0.12 K at \(\sim\)45 GPa. However, this small value of \(T_{c}\) makes the experimental verification very difficult.

## IV Conclusions

In conclusion, we have studied the high-pressure superconducting phase diagram of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\) from both experiments and first-principles calculations. Superconductivity shows a marked suppression above \(\sim\)0.25 GPa, along with drastic changes in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity. The first-principles calculations unveil the structural origin for this change, due to the shifting of the Pb atom from one Wyckoff coordinate to the other without changing its global symmetry. As a result, the nodal-line structure at the \(K\) point is partially gapped while the Dirac states around the \(H\) point are totally stripped away. The calculations further reveal a second structural transition at \(\sim\)30 GPa, which is accompanied with a topological phase transition, from a topologically nontrivial state to a topologically trivial state. In this new state, a superconducting dome of electron-phonon interaction in its pairing origin is uncovered in the calculations. The Fermi surface and surface band structure are also investigated. In a word, our calculations reveal how the electronic states of PbTaSe\({}_{2}\), especially its Dirac nodal states, both in the bulk and on the surface, evolve with pressure, which certainly motivates the need for more experimental investigations in due course.
