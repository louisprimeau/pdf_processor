###### Abstract

The superconducting and normal-state properties of the filled-skutterudite system PrT1-x EuxPt4Ge12 were studied. Polycrystalline samples were investigated via x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. Upon Eu substitution, we observed a crossover from superconducting to antiferromagnetic states with a region where both states coexist. In the superconducting region, the specific-heat data exhibit a change of temperature dependence, suggesting an evolution from a nodal to a nodeless superconducting energy gap or a suppression of multiband superconductivity. This change is relatively slower than those reported for different substituent ions, suggesting that paramagnetic impurities have a weaker pair-breaking effect on unconventional superconductivity in PrPt4Ge12. In the normal state, an evolution from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior was observed, accompanied by the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, suggesting that the underlying electronic structure is primarily responsible for the complex physical phenomena found in this system.

## I Introduction

A new class of filled-skutterudite compounds with the chemical formula MPt4Ge12 (M= alkali metal, alkaline earth, lanthanide, or actinide) has recently been reported [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These new Pt-Ge based skutterudite systems exhibit various strongly correlated electron phenomena. The compound PrPt4Ge12 is especially interesting since it is an unconventional superconductor that has properties similar to those of PrOs4Sb12: point nodes in the superconducting energy gap indicated by transverse muon spin relaxation (\muSR) and specific-heat measurements, evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) from zero-field \muSR measurements [5, 8], and multiband unconventional superconductivity (SC) suggested from previous reports [9, 10, 11]. Several chemical substitution studies based on specific-heat measurements reveal a suppression of superconductivity in PrPt4Ge12, accompanied by a crossover from a nodal to a nodeless superconducting energy gap or the suppression of multiple superconducting energy bands with increasing substituent composition [12, 13, 14].

Unconventional SC seems to be correlated with magnetism. The interplay between these two phenomena often leads to rich and intriguing physics with complex temperature T versus substituent composition or applied pressure phase diagrams, including pseudogaps, structural phase transitions, non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior, or quantum criticality. In many Fe-pnictide and cuprate compounds, the interplay between unconventional SC and antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is manifested in generic phase diagrams, in which the unconventional SC appears to emerge in a dome-shaped region near the composition or pressure where the antiferromagnetic order has been suppressed towards 0 K [15, 16]. The filled-skutterudite system PrT1-xNd_{x}Os4Sb12 shows the effect of magnetic moments on the normal and SC states of PrOs4Sb12, suggesting that superconductivity and magnetism coexist within the superconducting state [17, 18]. However, such an interplay between magnetism and unconventional SC in PrPt4Ge12 has not yet been reported to the best of our knowledge.

In the end member compound EuPt4Ge12, the Eu ion is divalent and the electronic configuration is the same as Gd3+ ion, J=S=7/2. The compound EuPt4Ge12 orders antiferromagnetically with a Neel temperature, T_{\text{N}}\sim 1.7 K with an effective magnetic moment, \mu_{\text{eff}}\sim 7.4\mu_{\text{B}} and a Curie-Weiss temperature, \Theta_{\text{CW}}\sim-11 K [19]. The value of T_{\text{N}} for EuPt4Ge12 is fairly low compared to other Eu-based filled-skutterudite compounds with the Eu2+ electronic configuration. For example, the compounds EuFe4X_{12} (X= Sb, As) are ferromagnetic with Curie temperatures T_{\text{c}}\sim 88 K and \sim 152 K, respectively, where the enhanced T_{\text{c}} has been attributed to the existence of a small magnetic moment (\sim 0.21\mu_{\text{B}} for the Fe-Sb cage) on the Fe ion [20, 21]. The low T_{\text{N}} value for EuPt4Ge12 is possibly due to absence of a magnetic moment on Pt in the Pt-Ge cage, leading to a decrease of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between the Eu2+ localized magnetic moment and the conduction-electron spins [19, 22]. This is seen in previous reports for the compounds EuRu4X_{12} with nonmagnetic Ru-X cages (ferromagnetic transition temperature T_{\text{c}}\sim 3.3 K for X= Sb and no magnetic anomaly down to 2 K for X= As) [20, 21, 23]. In addition, EuPt4Ge12 has a large Sommerfeld coefficient, \gamma\sim 220 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-1}, which has been attributed to Eu2+ spin fluctuations [19, 24].

In this paper, we report a study of the PrT1-x EuxPt4Ge12 system. The evolution of superconducting and magnetic properties with increasing Eu concentration x was studied by means of x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. We observed a crossover from SC to AFM and a suppression of SC with negative curvature as a function of x, and a Eu concentration range within which the two phases coexist. Our results from specific-heat measurements are similar to those of previous studies (Pr1-_x_Ce_{x}Pt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12-_x_Sb_{x}), suggesting a possible crossover from a nodal to a nodeless superconducting energy gap or from multiple energy gaps to a single BCS-type superconducting energy gap [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]; however, the crossover in the present case is much slower. In the normal state, we observed a crossover from Fermi-liquid (FL) to non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior in the Eu-rich region, suggesting that the intrinsic electronic structure is correlated to SC, AFM, and other possible complex physical phenomena in this system.

## II Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples of Pr1-_x_Eu,Pt4Ge12 were synthesized by arc-melting on a water-cooled copper hearth under an Ar atmosphere with a Zr getter and then annealed. The starting materials were Pr ingots (Alfa Aesar 99.9%), Eu ingots (Alfa Aesar 99.9%), Pt sponge (Engelhard 99.95%), and Ge pieces (Alfa Aesar 99.9999+_%_). The detailed procedures used to prepare the samples are reported elsewhere [13]. The crystal structure was determined by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Discover x-ray diffractometer with Cu-_K_a radiation, and XRD patterns were analyzed via Rietveld refinement by using the gsas+expgui software package [25, 26]. The electrical resistivity was measured from 1.1 to 300 K by using a standard four-wire method with a Linear Research LR700 AC resistance bridge in a home-built probe in a liquid ^{4}He Dewar, and down to \sim 100 mK (data below 0.35 K were rejected due to noise) using a commercial ^{3}He-^{4}He dilution refrigerator. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were made between 2 and 300 K in magnetic fields up to 7 T by using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS). Specific-heat measurements were performed at temperatures down to 1.8 K with a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) DynaCool and down to 0.5 K with the ^{3}He option for the PPMS DynaCool.

## III Results

### X-ray diffraction

Figure 1 shows results from XRD data for the Pr1-_x_Eu,Pt4Ge12 (0 <= x <= 1) system. All of the XRD patterns are well indexed with the cubic filled-skutterudite crystal structure with space group _Im_3. Figure 1 displays a representative XRD pattern of the Pr0.5Eu0.5Pt4Ge12 compound and the best fit from the Rietveld refinement. The dashed arrows indicate the contents of small impurity phases of Ge and/or PtGe2 (at most up to ~ 5% by molar mass ratio), as is commonly observed in the Pt-Ge based skutterudites [3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 27, 28]. Since Eu ions are divalent in the end member compound EuPt4Ge12 [19, 24], and the atomic radius of Eu2+ ions is larger than that of the Pr3+ ions, the lattice parameter a exhibits a linear increase throughout the entire range of x, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1; however, there are discrepancies in the a values for EuPt4Ge12 between previous reports and our study, which is possibly due to a known sample dependence in the Pt-Ge based filled-skutterudites; reported values of a for EuPt4Ge12 differ by roughly 0.5% [3, 28].

### Electrical resistivity

The results of electrical resistivity, \rho(T), measurements are shown in Fig. 2. All samples exhibit metallic behavior in their normal states, as seen in Fig. 2(a); we show some representative concentrations for visual clarity. The residual resistivity ratio, RRR (\rho_{300}/\rho_{0}), versus x is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), where \rho_{300} is the room-temperature resistivity and \rho_{0} is the resistivity value right above the SC or AFM transition. The RRR(_x_) exhibits a parabolic shape with the minimum around x = 0.5, consistent with the expected minimum for simple alloys. Figure 2(b) displays \rho(T) normalized to its value at 10 K versus x. The _T_c value was defined as the temperature where the value of \rho(T)/\rho_{10} drops to 0.5, and the width of the transition was determined by the temperatures where \rho(T)/\rho_{10} is 0.9 and 0.1. A monotonic decrease of _T_c is observed to x = 0.5, with slightly broadened transitions for x > 0.3. We also performed \rho(T) measurements down to 0.35 K on the selected samples with x = 0.6, 0.8, and 0.9; however, there was no sign of SC. In Fig. 2(c), \rho(T) data for Eu-rich compounds, shown with vertical translations for visual clarity, exhibit kinks associated with AFM transitions [19]. The Neel temperature _T_N decreases from \sim 1.7 K for x = 1 to \sim 0.8 K for x = 0.8; we did not observe any clear feature associated with the AFM transitions for samples with x < 0.8, down to 0.35 K.

Figure 1: X-ray diffraction pattern for Pr0.5Eu0.5Pt4Ge12. The black crosses represent the experimental data and the red line represents the fit from the Rietveld refinement of the data. The magenta vertical marks indicate the position of expected Bragg reflections and the blue line at the bottom is the difference between observed and calculated intensities. The dashed arrows indicate Bragg reflections associated with a Ge or PtGe2 impurity phase. The inset shows a plot of the lattice parameter a versus nominal Eu concentration x. The red dashed line is a guide to the eye.

  Figure 3(a) shows a log-log plot of \rho-\rho_{0} versus T with vertical translations for visual clarity. The red solid lines represent least squares fits to the data with the formula

\[\ln(\rho(T)-\rho_{0})=\ln(A_{n})+n\ln(T),\] (1)

in the temperature range from just above T_{\rm c} or T_{\rm N} to \sim15 K. Interestingly, a gradual change of n values was observed throughout the entire substitution range from n\sim 5 at x=0 to n\sim 1 at x=1. For Pr-rich samples, they are consistent with the Bloch-Gruneisen behavior, since they have rather large n values from \sim 4 to \sim 5, as seen in Fig. 2(a). The negative curvature of \rho(T) at elevated temperatures is indicative of a narrow feature in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level [29]. For EuPt_{4}Ge_{12}, it has been reported that evidence of a FL ground state, a T^{2} dependence of \rho(T), is not recovered even under applied magnetic field at 12 T [19], suggesting that the system may show a crossover from a FL to a NFL ground state. For x>0.5, we observe kinks in Fig. 3(a) where the slopes n change. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the value of n decreases from \sim 5 to \sim 1, suggesting a type of crossover from FL to NFL behavior with decreasing temperature; this result may indicate that magnetic fluctuations associated with Eu ions in the EuPt_{4}Ge_{12}[19] become even weaker with increasing Pr substitution. The corresponding fitting parameters A_{n} and \rho_{0} versus x are shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), respectively. The coefficient A_{n} increases monotonically while the residual resistivity \rho_{0} has a parabolic shape with a maximum at x\sim 0.5. The scatter in the values of A_{n}(x) and \rho_{0}(x) are probably due to uncertainties in the measurement of the geometrical factors of the resistivity samples.

### Magnetic susceptibility

Magnetization divided by applied magnetic field, M/H, versus T data are displayed in Fig. 4(a). Measurements were made under an applied magnetic field of H=0.1 T. The overall magnitude of M/H increases with increasing x, becoming more temperature dependent. Figure 4(b) shows superconducting transitions for 0\leqslant x\leqslant 0.45 in an applied magnetic field H=10 Oe. We defined T_{\rm c} as the temperature where zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) data start to deviate from one another. The superconducting volume fractions were estimated from the ZFC M(T)/H data by using the relation 4\pi\,d\times M/H (\equiv 4\pi\,\chi_{\rm vol}), where d is the molar density of the samples in units of mol/cm^{3}. The values of the volume fractions, 4\pi\,\chi_{\rm vol}, scatter around 1, which results from the uncertainties in determining demagnetization factors for this analysis. We fit the M(T)/H data to a Curie-Weiss law in the temperature ranges from 75 to 300 K for 0\leqslant x\leqslant 0.2 due to the observed broad maxima near 75 K for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[4, 12, 13] and from possible lowest temperatures to 300 K for the rest of samples

\[M/H=C_{0}/(T-\Theta_{\rm CW}),\] (2)

where C_{0} is the Curie constant and \Theta_{\rm CW} is the Curie-Weiss temperature. The average effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} of the Eu and Pr mixture is estimated by using the relation C_{0}=\mu_{\rm eff}^{2}N_{\rm A}/3k_{\rm B}, where N_{\rm A} is Avogadro's number and k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann's constant. The best-fit values are shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). Values of \mu_{\rm eff}(x) increase from \sim 3.64\mu_{\rm B} to \sim 7.9\mu_{\rm B}. The data are consistent with the calculated values, indicated by the red line in Fig. 4(b), by using the relation

\[\mu_{\rm eff}(x)=\sqrt{(\mu_{\rm Pb^{3+}})^{2}(1-x)+(\mu_{\rm Eu^{2+}})^{2}(x)},\] (3)

Figure 3: (a) A double logarithmic plot of \rho-\rho_{0} versus T for Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} with vertical translations for visual clarity. Linear fits of Eq. (1) were made to data up to T\sim 15 K, indicated by the red solid lines. The gradual change of n from \sim 5 at x=0 to \sim 1 at x=1 was observed. The thicker solid lines are for reference, with different n values (n=1, 2, and 5, respectively). The black asterisks point out the temperatures where the value of n changes for Eu-rich compounds. The light-blue filled area denotes the SC region. The corresponding fitting parameters n and A_{n}, and residual resistivity \rho_{0}, versus x are shown in panels (b)–(d), respectively.

Figure 2: (a) Electrical resistivity data \rho versus T for selected Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples. Displayed in the inset is a plot of the residual resistivity ratio RRR versus x for Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The RRR shows a parabolic shape with the minimum at x=0.5. (b) \rho(T), normalized to its value at 10 K, versus x for superconducting Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples. The superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} decreases with increasing x. The dashed arrow is a guide to the eye. (c) \rho(T) versus x with offsets for Eu-rich compounds exhibiting kinks associated with an antiferromagnetic transition, indicated by solid arrows. The Néel temperature T_{\rm N} decreases slowly from x=1 to 0.8.

  where the free-ion values of \mu_{\rm Pb^{3+}} and \mu_{\rm Eu^{4+2}} are 3.58\mu_{\rm B} and 7.94\mu_{\rm B}, respectively. This result indicates that the spin configuration of the Eu^{2+} ion is stable in our alloy system, as would be expected for Gd^{3+} substitution in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}.

The dependence of the Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta_{\rm CW} on x has a parabolic shape with a maximum around x\sim 0.5, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Note that for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, there is evidence of crystalline electric field (CEF) splitting of the Hund's rule ground-state multiplet with a \Gamma_{4}^{(1)} triplet as the first-excited state [4], while there are no CEF effects in EuPt_{4}Ge_{12} since Eu^{2+} is an S-state ion [19]. The systematic substitution of Eu for Pr could be a reason for the decrease in magnitude of the \Theta_{\rm CW} up to x\sim 0.5, possibly due to the dilution of CEF effects. The increase in magnitude of \Theta_{\rm CW} for x\geqslant 0.5 is probably due to the AFM order.

### Specific heat

Specific heat, C, versus T data are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) for selected samples for the sake of visual clarity. Anomalies associated with the onset of SC were observed in samples with x<0.45. Since Neel temperatures T_{\rm N} are below 1.8 K in the resistivity data, we performed low-temperature specific-heat measurements on samples with x=0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 0.38, and 0.3, down to 0.5 K. In Fig. 5(c), the values of T_{\rm N} (indicated by red arrows) are suppressed with increasing Pr content until x\sim 0.38. These results are consistent with those from the resistivity data. A previous study on EuPt_{4}Ge_{12} by Nicklas _et al._[24] reported that EuPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits complex magnetic order at low temperature [indicated by black arrows in Fig. 5(c)]. It seems these additional transitions are suppressed with increasing Pr concentration for x=0.95, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7 at least; however, further investigations are needed, since the nature of this complex magnetic order has not yet been clarified.

The coefficients of the electronic and lattice contributions to the specific heat, \gamma and \beta, respectively, were determined using linear fits:

\[C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2},\] (4)

in the range from the lowest nonordered temperature to \sim 250 K^{2} (data not shown). In Fig. 6(a), the \gamma values first increase from \sim 45 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} at x=0 to \sim 76 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} at x=0.5 in the SC region and then increase more rapidly up to \sim 224 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}at x=1 in the Eu-rich region. Such different rates of increase in the \gamma values suggest that stronger electronic correlations or Eu^{2+} spin fluctuations, as reflected in the AFM nature of EuPt_{4}Ge_{12}[19, 22], are more clearly manifested in the Eu-rich region. The value we obtained for \gamma of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} deviates from the values reported in other studies; however, this could be due to the different methods employed for determining \gamma values [3, 5, 11, 13, 14]. Even though the \gamma value for x=1 is about half of \gamma\sim 500 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[31, 32], it is still a fairly large enhancement of \gamma; further research on EuPt_{4}Ge_{12} would be of interest. The Debye temperature, \Theta_{\rm D}, was obtained by using the relation \Theta_{\rm D}=[1944(n_{\rm f.u.}/\beta)]^{1/3} K, where n_{\rm f.u.}=17, the number of atoms in the formula unit. As seen in Fig. 6(b), \Theta_{\rm D} shows a small increase with increasing x.

Since the systematic upturns in specific heat at low temperature [see Fig. 5(b)] are simultaneously present with SC anomalies, our ability to determine the exact T_{\rm c} values is compromised. The electronic contribution to the specific heat, C_{\rm e}(T), was obtained by subtracting the phonon contribution, C_{\rm ph}(T)=\beta T^{3}, from the C(T) data. A log-log plot of C_{\rm e} versus

(b) The Meissner and diamagnetic shielding fractions 4\pi\,\chi_{\rm val} versus T for superconducting samples. The diamagnetic shielding fractions are close to 1. The deviations from unity are probably due to uncertainties in estimating the demagnetization factor. (c) Effective magnetic moment, obtained from the fit (\mu_{\rm eff}/\mu_{\rm B}) versus x; the value of \mu_{\rm eff}(x)/\mu_{\rm B} increases from \mu_{\rm eff}\sim 3.64\mu_{\rm B} at x=0 to \mu_{\rm eff}\sim 7.9\mu_{\rm B} at x=1. The red line is determined from a calculation by using Eq. (3). (d) Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta_{\rm CW} versus x. As x is increased, \Theta_{\rm CW} first increases to x\sim 0.5 and then decreases to x=1. The dashed lines are guides to the eye.

(c) C/T versus T data at low temperatures for Eu-rich compounds. The Néel temperature, T_{\rm N} are suppressed with increasing Pr content, as indicated by red arrows. The multiple magnetic transitions (black arrows) defined by Nicklas _et al._[30] are shown as a reference.

  T in Fig. 6(c) shows that the upturns in C(T) have a power-law type divergence; the values of the slopes scatter around \sim-1. Therefore, we subtracted this upturn in C(T) from the data by using the relation

\[C(T)=\gamma\,T+\beta\,T^{3}+p\,T^{-q},\] (5)

where p and q are the fitting parameters. First, we fixed the \gamma and \beta values obtained from linear fits by using Eq. (4) and performed least-squares fits of Eq. (5) to the data in order to determine p and q values and subtract only the upturn from the data. An example for Pr_{0.8}Eu_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is displayed in Fig. 6(d). The fitting parameter q scattered between \sim 0.8 and \sim 1.1, consistent with the observation in Fig. 6(c). The SC anomalies after subtraction of the upturns are shown as a plot of C_{a}/T versus T in Fig. 6(e), showing a systematic decrease of T_{\rm c}, consistent with results obtained from resistivity and magnetization data. However, we did not observe clear features of SC for the x=0.45 and 0.5 samples, possibly due to broad superconducting transitions and low T_{\rm c} values.

Figure 7 displays semilogarithmic plots of C_{e}/\gamma\,T_{\rm c} versus T_{\rm c}/T for Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} up to x=0.3. The fits to the data were performed in the range 1\leq T_{\rm c}/T\leq T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm min}, where T_{\rm min} is the lowest temperature available in the data. The red lines in Figs. 7(a)-7(c) show that the compounds with x\leq 0.1 are best described by the power-law formula b(T_{\rm c}/T)^{-m}, where b and m are the fitting parameters, whose values are listed in Fig. 7. This power-law temperature dependence suggests multiband superconductivity or nodes in the gap function in these compounds [5]. In the case of nodes in the gap structure, it is intriguing to note that such a change in m values from \sim 3 to \sim 2 may suggest that the gap structure evolves from point-like to line nodes [33]. In Figs. 7(d)-7(f), the blue lines are the fits of an exponential temperature dependence ae^{-\Delta/T_{\rm c}}, where a is a fitting parameter and \Delta is the SC energy gap; these values are listed in Figs. 7(d)-7(f). These results suggest that the compounds with x\geq 0.15 exhibit single-band isotropic s-wave SC.

Similar crossovers or changes from power-law to exponential temperature dependence in C(T) the superconducting state were observed in previous studies for the Pr(Os_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{4}Sb_{12}, Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12-x}Sb_{x} systems [12; 13; 34; 35]. A possible explanation for this change is a crossover in the superconducting energy gap from point nodes to nodeless structures, or a suppression of one or more superconducting energy gaps in a multiband superconductor [5; 10; 11; 33]. Recently, low-temperature specific-heat measurements on Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} suggest the presence of both a nodal and a nodeless gap on different parts of the Fermi surface in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, which are suppressed with different rates upon increasing Ce substitutions [14]. This scenario would be another explanation for the noninteger values of m in the x=0.05 and 0.1 data and the low-temperature upturns or deviations from the linear fits for the x=0.15 and 0.2 samples. However, the latter deviations could also be due to the fact that

The \gamma values first increase slowly to x=0.5 then increase faster to x=1 (see text), while the values of \Theta_{\rm D} show a moderate increase with increasing x. Dashed lines are guides to the eye. (c) A systematic increase of the upturn in C(T) at low temperature is displayed as a log-log plot of the electronic specific-heat contribution, C_{\rm c} versus T.

The red and blue lines represent the best fits to the data with (a)–(c) power-law behavior b(T_{\rm c}/T)^{-m}, and (d)–(f) exponential behavior ae^{-\Delta/T_{\rm c}}, respectively.

  the values of \Delta\,/\,T_{\rm c} could vary depending on the fitting range [36]. More detailed studies of low-temperature specific heat on the \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} system are underway. These studies will be able to discriminate between these different scenarios and will reveal the nature of the superconducting order parameters and their evolution with Eu concentration.

## IV Discussion

Figure 8 summarizes the results from \rho(T), \chi_{\rm vol}(T), and C(T) measurements in a temperature, T, versus europium, x, (T-x), phase diagram. The SC transition temperature, T_{\rm c}, values were taken from the onset of diamagnetic signals in the \chi_{\rm vol}(T) data. For the C(T) measurements, T_{\rm c} was determined from the results of idealized entropy-conserving constructions [37, 38] (data not shown). The error bars were taken from the width of transitions in both resistivity and specific-heat data. These T_{\rm c} values estimated by different measurements exhibit a consistent trend in which SC is suppressed with negative curvature up to x\simeq 0.6. The suppression rate of T_{\rm c} for \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} is different compared with our previous substitution studies of \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Ce}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} and \text{Pr}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12-x}\text{Sb}_{x}, which show suppressions of T_{\rm c} with positive curvature [12, 13]. Since Eu ions have a stable divalent electronic state in the skutterudite structure [24], the crystalline electric field effects are expected to be absent. Thus, we could consider the effect on SC of substituting Eu^{+2} ions as similar to that of substituting Gd^{3+} for Pr. The monotonic change of our \mu_{\rm eff} data [see Fig. 4(c)] supports this scenario. Rare-earth impurities with stable valences are believed to exhibit ferromagnetic exchange interactions with a host superconductor (in this case, \text{Pr}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12}) wherein the depression of T_{\rm c} with paramagnetic impurity concentration is described by the Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) theory [39], as has been demonstrated for the \text{La}_{1-x}\text{Gd}_{x}\text{Al}_{2} system [40]. The negative curvature of T_{\rm c}(x) in this study seems to be consistent with the AG theory, compared with the results of the Ce substitution study, in which the depression of T_{\rm c} with x resembles the behavior expected for a system in which the paramagnetic impurities produce a Kondo effect in which the Kondo temperature is much larger than the SC transition temperature T_{\rm c}. On the other hand, the substitution of Eu^{2+} ions (hole doping), is different from that of Gd^{3+} (isoelectronic substitution). A nonisovalent mixture of Pr and Eu would probably affect T_{\rm c} in \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12}, since charge is transferred from the rare-earth guest ions to the host material. This would, in turn, change the Fermi level, which is one of crucial parameters that controls SC in the M\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} compounds, as reported in a previous study on the \text{BaPt}_{4-x}\text{Au}_{x}\text{Ge}_{12} system [41]. However, the doping into the Pr site may have a weaker effect on SC than doping into the Pt-Ge cage, since the Fermi surface of \text{Pr}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} is mainly composed of the Ge-4p orbitals with small contributions from the Pt-5d orbitals [7]. In the SC states of the \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} system, the situation is more complicated than in \text{La}_{1-x}\text{Gd}_{x}\text{Al}_{2}, as we observed evidence for a crossover in the SC energy gap from point-nodes to nodeless structures, or a suppression of one or more superconducting energy gaps in a multiband superconductor [5, 10, 11, 14, 33]. This crossover behavior is depicted by the color gradient below the T_{\rm c} versus x curve in Fig. 8.

The Neel temperatures T_{\rm N} were consistent between the \rho(T) and the low-temperature C(T) data. The \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} system exhibits a crossover from SC to AFM states with increasing x and, more interestingly, a coexistence of those two states in the range of 0.2\simeq x\simeq 0.6. Such a coexistence of AFM and SC has been observed in other conventional and unconventional SC containing localized magnetic moments [42, 43, 44]. As recently suggested by Singh _et al._[14], our system seems to show that the nodal gap is being suppressed relatively slowly upon Eu substitution in the SC and coexistence regions compared with the rapid suppressions observed in previous reports [12, 13]. In the nonordered states, i.e., the high-temperature region, the system shows an evolution of the power dependence of the resistivity in the formula \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}, shown as a color contour plot in Fig. 8. The values of n change from n\sim 5 at Pr-rich sites to n\sim 2 (FL behavior) at x\sim 0.5, and then enters a NFL state with n\sim 1 at Eu-rich sites. Such FL to NFL transition is also manifested by small kinks observed in the resistivity data (see Fig. 3). In the specific-heat data, we did not observe a very clear logarithmic divergence (data not shown), C(T)/T\sim(-1/\,T_{0})\text{ln}(T/\,T_{0}), which is believed to be a nearly universal feature of NFL behavior in specific heat [45]; however, a weak power-law divergence could be also an indication for NFL behavior [45] and the divergence in specific heat could vary between different systems [46]. Therefore, we speculate that the rather large jumps in the specific heat for the Eu-rich compounds are possibly the combination of AFM transitions and the divergence due to the NFL behavior. However, there are other possible scenarios for the observed kinks in resistivity;

Figure 8: A plot of temperature, T, versus Eu concentration, x, (T-x), phase diagram. The vertical bars in the T_{\rm c}(x) data represent the widths of the superconducting transitions (see text). The suppression of T_{\rm c} with x has negative curvature and extrapolates to 0 K near x=0.6. The blue gradient-filled area under the T_{\rm c} versus x curve represents the change of the temperature-dependence of low-temperature specific heat, C_{\rm c}/\,\gamma T_{\rm c}=b(T_{\rm c}/\,T)^{-m} to ae^{-\beta/T_{\rm c}}. The Néel temperature T_{\rm N} decreases slowly from x=1 to x\simeq 0.38. SC and AFM may coexist in the region between x\simeq 0.2 and \simeq 0.6. The black circles with crosses are the temperatures T_{n}, where resistivity slopes have kinks as seen in Fig. 3(a). The color contour plot in the background displays the evolution of the power n values in the formula, \text{ln}(\rho(T)-\rho_{0})=\text{ln}(A_{n})+n\text{ln}(T).

  for example, subtle structural phase transitions, which have been reported in skutterudite-related systems [47].

Our study of Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} shows a complex phase diagram with SC to AFM and FL to NFL crossovers, suggesting that changes in the underlying electronic structure "tune" competing interactions in this system; this interpretation could be supported by the scenario of multiband type of SC with different energy gap structures in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[9, 10, 11, 14]. Since there is no report of the GdPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound, it would be interesting to perform a substitution study of Pr_{1-x}Gd_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} as a comparative study with the current study. Subsequent studies of density functional theory (DFT) calculations on Pr_{1-x}(Eu,Gd)_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} would give us better understanding of the relationship of the electronic density of states (DOS) and paramagnetic impurities on the nature of unconventional SC in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}.

## V Concluding remarks

We studied the superconducting and normal-state properties of the unconventional superconductor PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, in which Eu has been substituted for Pr. Polycrystalline samples of Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} were investigated via x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. Upon Eu substitution, we observed a crossover from superconducting to antiferromagnetically ordered states with a region where superconductivity and antiferromagnetism may coexist. In the superconducting region, the specific-heat data exhibit a crossover of temperature dependence, suggesting a change from a nodal to a nodeless superconducting energy gap or suppression of multiband superconductivity. This crossover is relatively slower than previous reports of different substitution studies, suggesting paramagnetic impurities have a weaker pair-breaking effect on the unconventional superconductivity in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. In the normal state, we observed a crossover from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior, accompanied by a coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, suggesting intrinsic electronic structures may be correlated with the complex physical phenomena in this system.

###### Abstract

The superconducting and normal-state properties of the filled-skutterudite system PrT1-x EuxPt4Ge12 were studied. Polycrystalline samples were investigated via x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. Upon Eu substitution, we observed a crossover from superconducting to antiferromagnetic states with a region where both states coexist. In the superconducting region, the specific-heat data exhibit a change of temperature dependence, suggesting an evolution from a nodal to a nodeless superconducting energy gap or a suppression of multiband superconductivity. This change is relatively slower than those reported for different substituent ions, suggesting that paramagnetic impurities have a weaker pair-breaking effect on unconventional superconductivity in PrPt4Ge12. In the normal state, an evolution from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior was observed, accompanied by the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, suggesting that the underlying electronic structure is primarily responsible for the complex physical phenomena found in this system.

## I Introduction

A new class of filled-skutterudite compounds with the chemical formula MPt4Ge12 (M= alkali metal, alkaline earth, lanthanide, or actinide) has recently been reported [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These new Pt-Ge based skutterudite systems exhibit various strongly correlated electron phenomena. The compound PrPt4Ge12 is especially interesting since it is an unconventional superconductor that has properties similar to those of PrOs4Sb12: point nodes in the superconducting energy gap indicated by transverse muon spin relaxation (\muSR) and specific-heat measurements, evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) from zero-field \muSR measurements [5, 8], and multiband unconventional superconductivity (SC) suggested from previous reports [9, 10, 11]. Several chemical substitution studies based on specific-heat measurements reveal a suppression of superconductivity in PrPt4Ge12, accompanied by a crossover from a nodal to a nodeless superconducting energy gap or the suppression of multiple superconducting energy bands with increasing substituent composition [12, 13, 14].

Unconventional SC seems to be correlated with magnetism. The interplay between these two phenomena often leads to rich and intriguing physics with complex temperature T versus substituent composition or applied pressure phase diagrams, including pseudogaps, structural phase transitions, non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior, or quantum criticality. In many Fe-pnictide and cuprate compounds, the interplay between unconventional SC and antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is manifested in generic phase diagrams, in which the unconventional SC appears to emerge in a dome-shaped region near the composition or pressure where the antiferromagnetic order has been suppressed towards 0 K [15, 16]. The filled-skutterudite system PrT1-xNd_{x}Os4Sb12 shows the effect of magnetic moments on the normal and SC states of PrOs4Sb12, suggesting that superconductivity and magnetism coexist within the superconducting state [17, 18]. However, such an interplay between magnetism and unconventional SC in PrPt4Ge12 has not yet been reported to the best of our knowledge.

In the end member compound EuPt4Ge12, the Eu ion is divalent and the electronic configuration is the same as Gd3+ ion, J=S=7/2. The compound EuPt4Ge12 orders antiferromagnetically with a Neel temperature, T_{\text{N}}\sim 1.7 K with an effective magnetic moment, \mu_{\text{eff}}\sim 7.4\mu_{\text{B}} and a Curie-Weiss temperature, \Theta_{\text{CW}}\sim-11 K [19]. The value of T_{\text{N}} for EuPt4Ge12 is fairly low compared to other Eu-based filled-skutterudite compounds with the Eu2+ electronic configuration. For example, the compounds EuFe4X_{12} (X= Sb, As) are ferromagnetic with Curie temperatures T_{\text{c}}\sim 88 K and \sim 152 K, respectively, where the enhanced T_{\text{c}} has been attributed to the existence of a small magnetic moment (\sim 0.21\mu_{\text{B}} for the Fe-Sb cage) on the Fe ion [20, 21]. The low T_{\text{N}} value for EuPt4Ge12 is possibly due to absence of a magnetic moment on Pt in the Pt-Ge cage, leading to a decrease of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between the Eu2+ localized magnetic moment and the conduction-electron spins [19, 22]. This is seen in previous reports for the compounds EuRu4X_{12} with nonmagnetic Ru-X cages (ferromagnetic transition temperature T_{\text{c}}\sim 3.3 K for X= Sb and no magnetic anomaly down to 2 K for X= As) [20, 21, 23]. In addition, EuPt4Ge12 has a large Sommerfeld coefficient, \gamma\sim 220 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-1}, which has been attributed to Eu2+ spin fluctuations [19, 24].

In this paper, we report a study of the PrT1-x EuxPt4Ge12 system. The evolution of superconducting and magnetic properties with increasing Eu concentration x was studied by means of x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. We observed a crossover from SC to AFM and a suppression of SC with negative curvature as a function of x, and a Eu concentration range within which the two phases coexist. Our results from specific-heat measurements are similar to those of previous studies (Pr1-_x_Ce_{x}Pt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12-_x_Sb_{x}), suggesting a possible crossover from a nodal to a nodeless superconducting energy gap or from multiple energy gaps to a single BCS-type superconducting energy gap [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]; however, the crossover in the present case is much slower. In the normal state, we observed a crossover from Fermi-liquid (FL) to non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior in the Eu-rich region, suggesting that the intrinsic electronic structure is correlated to SC, AFM, and other possible complex physical phenomena in this system.

## II Experimental Details

Polycrystalline samples of Pr1-_x_Eu,Pt4Ge12 were synthesized by arc-melting on a water-cooled copper hearth under an Ar atmosphere with a Zr getter and then annealed. The starting materials were Pr ingots (Alfa Aesar 99.9%), Eu ingots (Alfa Aesar 99.9%), Pt sponge (Engelhard 99.95%), and Ge pieces (Alfa Aesar 99.9999+_%_). The detailed procedures used to prepare the samples are reported elsewhere [13]. The crystal structure was determined by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Discover x-ray diffractometer with Cu-_K_a radiation, and XRD patterns were analyzed via Rietveld refinement by using the gsas+expgui software package [25, 26]. The electrical resistivity was measured from 1.1 to 300 K by using a standard four-wire method with a Linear Research LR700 AC resistance bridge in a home-built probe in a liquid ^{4}He Dewar, and down to \sim 100 mK (data below 0.35 K were rejected due to noise) using a commercial ^{3}He-^{4}He dilution refrigerator. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were made between 2 and 300 K in magnetic fields up to 7 T by using a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS). Specific-heat measurements were performed at temperatures down to 1.8 K with a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) DynaCool and down to 0.5 K with the ^{3}He option for the PPMS DynaCool.

## III Results

### X-ray diffraction

Figure 1 shows results from XRD data for the Pr1-_x_Eu,Pt4Ge12 (0 <= x <= 1) system. All of the XRD patterns are well indexed with the cubic filled-skutterudite crystal structure with space group _Im_3. Figure 1 displays a representative XRD pattern of the Pr0.5Eu0.5Pt4Ge12 compound and the best fit from the Rietveld refinement. The dashed arrows indicate the contents of small impurity phases of Ge and/or PtGe2 (at most up to ~ 5% by molar mass ratio), as is commonly observed in the Pt-Ge based skutterudites [3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, 27, 28]. Since Eu ions are divalent in the end member compound EuPt4Ge12 [19, 24], and the atomic radius of Eu2+ ions is larger than that of the Pr3+ ions, the lattice parameter a exhibits a linear increase throughout the entire range of x, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1; however, there are discrepancies in the a values for EuPt4Ge12 between previous reports and our study, which is possibly due to a known sample dependence in the Pt-Ge based filled-skutterudites; reported values of a for EuPt4Ge12 differ by roughly 0.5% [3, 28].

### Electrical resistivity

The results of electrical resistivity, \rho(T), measurements are shown in Fig. 2. All samples exhibit metallic behavior in their normal states, as seen in Fig. 2(a); we show some representative concentrations for visual clarity. The residual resistivity ratio, RRR (\rho_{300}/\rho_{0}), versus x is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), where \rho_{300} is the room-temperature resistivity and \rho_{0} is the resistivity value right above the SC or AFM transition. The RRR(_x_) exhibits a parabolic shape with the minimum around x = 0.5, consistent with the expected minimum for simple alloys. Figure 2(b) displays \rho(T) normalized to its value at 10 K versus x. The _T_c value was defined as the temperature where the value of \rho(T)/\rho_{10} drops to 0.5, and the width of the transition was determined by the temperatures where \rho(T)/\rho_{10} is 0.9 and 0.1. A monotonic decrease of _T_c is observed to x = 0.5, with slightly broadened transitions for x > 0.3. We also performed \rho(T) measurements down to 0.35 K on the selected samples with x = 0.6, 0.8, and 0.9; however, there was no sign of SC. In Fig. 2(c), \rho(T) data for Eu-rich compounds, shown with vertical translations for visual clarity, exhibit kinks associated with AFM transitions [19]. The Neel temperature _T_N decreases from \sim 1.7 K for x = 1 to \sim 0.8 K for x = 0.8; we did not observe any clear feature associated with the AFM transitions for samples with x < 0.8, down to 0.35 K.

Figure 1: X-ray diffraction pattern for Pr0.5Eu0.5Pt4Ge12. The black crosses represent the experimental data and the red line represents the fit from the Rietveld refinement of the data. The magenta vertical marks indicate the position of expected Bragg reflections and the blue line at the bottom is the difference between observed and calculated intensities. The dashed arrows indicate Bragg reflections associated with a Ge or PtGe2 impurity phase. The inset shows a plot of the lattice parameter a versus nominal Eu concentration x. The red dashed line is a guide to the eye.

  Figure 3(a) shows a log-log plot of \rho-\rho_{0} versus T with vertical translations for visual clarity. The red solid lines represent least squares fits to the data with the formula

\[\ln(\rho(T)-\rho_{0})=\ln(A_{n})+n\ln(T),\] (1)

in the temperature range from just above T_{\rm c} or T_{\rm N} to \sim15 K. Interestingly, a gradual change of n values was observed throughout the entire substitution range from n\sim 5 at x=0 to n\sim 1 at x=1. For Pr-rich samples, they are consistent with the Bloch-Gruneisen behavior, since they have rather large n values from \sim 4 to \sim 5, as seen in Fig. 2(a). The negative curvature of \rho(T) at elevated temperatures is indicative of a narrow feature in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level [29]. For EuPt_{4}Ge_{12}, it has been reported that evidence of a FL ground state, a T^{2} dependence of \rho(T), is not recovered even under applied magnetic field at 12 T [19], suggesting that the system may show a crossover from a FL to a NFL ground state. For x>0.5, we observe kinks in Fig. 3(a) where the slopes n change. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the value of n decreases from \sim 5 to \sim 1, suggesting a type of crossover from FL to NFL behavior with decreasing temperature; this result may indicate that magnetic fluctuations associated with Eu ions in the EuPt_{4}Ge_{12}[19] become even weaker with increasing Pr substitution. The corresponding fitting parameters A_{n} and \rho_{0} versus x are shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d), respectively. The coefficient A_{n} increases monotonically while the residual resistivity \rho_{0} has a parabolic shape with a maximum at x\sim 0.5. The scatter in the values of A_{n}(x) and \rho_{0}(x) are probably due to uncertainties in the measurement of the geometrical factors of the resistivity samples.

### Magnetic susceptibility

Magnetization divided by applied magnetic field, M/H, versus T data are displayed in Fig. 4(a). Measurements were made under an applied magnetic field of H=0.1 T. The overall magnitude of M/H increases with increasing x, becoming more temperature dependent. Figure 4(b) shows superconducting transitions for 0\leqslant x\leqslant 0.45 in an applied magnetic field H=10 Oe. We defined T_{\rm c} as the temperature where zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) data start to deviate from one another. The superconducting volume fractions were estimated from the ZFC M(T)/H data by using the relation 4\pi\,d\times M/H (\equiv 4\pi\,\chi_{\rm vol}), where d is the molar density of the samples in units of mol/cm^{3}. The values of the volume fractions, 4\pi\,\chi_{\rm vol}, scatter around 1, which results from the uncertainties in determining demagnetization factors for this analysis. We fit the M(T)/H data to a Curie-Weiss law in the temperature ranges from 75 to 300 K for 0\leqslant x\leqslant 0.2 due to the observed broad maxima near 75 K for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[4, 12, 13] and from possible lowest temperatures to 300 K for the rest of samples

\[M/H=C_{0}/(T-\Theta_{\rm CW}),\] (2)

where C_{0} is the Curie constant and \Theta_{\rm CW} is the Curie-Weiss temperature. The average effective magnetic moment \mu_{\rm eff} of the Eu and Pr mixture is estimated by using the relation C_{0}=\mu_{\rm eff}^{2}N_{\rm A}/3k_{\rm B}, where N_{\rm A} is Avogadro's number and k_{\rm B} is Boltzmann's constant. The best-fit values are shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). Values of \mu_{\rm eff}(x) increase from \sim 3.64\mu_{\rm B} to \sim 7.9\mu_{\rm B}. The data are consistent with the calculated values, indicated by the red line in Fig. 4(b), by using the relation

\[\mu_{\rm eff}(x)=\sqrt{(\mu_{\rm Pb^{3+}})^{2}(1-x)+(\mu_{\rm Eu^{2+}})^{2}(x)},\] (3)

(1) were made to data up to T\sim 15 K, indicated by the red solid lines. The gradual change of n from \sim 5 at x=0 to \sim 1 at x=1 was observed. The thicker solid lines are for reference, with different n values (n=1, 2, and 5, respectively). The black asterisks point out the temperatures where the value of n changes for Eu-rich compounds. The light-blue filled area denotes the SC region. The corresponding fitting parameters n and A_{n}, and residual resistivity \rho_{0}, versus x are shown in panels (b)–(d), respectively.

Displayed in the inset is a plot of the residual resistivity ratio RRR versus x for Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}. The RRR shows a parabolic shape with the minimum at x=0.5. (b) \rho(T), normalized to its value at 10 K, versus x for superconducting Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} samples. The superconducting transition temperature T_{\rm c} decreases with increasing x. The dashed arrow is a guide to the eye. (c) \rho(T) versus x with offsets for Eu-rich compounds exhibiting kinks associated with an antiferromagnetic transition, indicated by solid arrows. The Néel temperature T_{\rm N} decreases slowly from x=1 to 0.8.

  where the free-ion values of \mu_{\rm Pb^{3+}} and \mu_{\rm Eu^{4+2}} are 3.58\mu_{\rm B} and 7.94\mu_{\rm B}, respectively. This result indicates that the spin configuration of the Eu^{2+} ion is stable in our alloy system, as would be expected for Gd^{3+} substitution in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}.

The dependence of the Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta_{\rm CW} on x has a parabolic shape with a maximum around x\sim 0.5, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Note that for PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, there is evidence of crystalline electric field (CEF) splitting of the Hund's rule ground-state multiplet with a \Gamma_{4}^{(1)} triplet as the first-excited state [4], while there are no CEF effects in EuPt_{4}Ge_{12} since Eu^{2+} is an S-state ion [19]. The systematic substitution of Eu for Pr could be a reason for the decrease in magnitude of the \Theta_{\rm CW} up to x\sim 0.5, possibly due to the dilution of CEF effects. The increase in magnitude of \Theta_{\rm CW} for x\geqslant 0.5 is probably due to the AFM order.

### Specific heat

Specific heat, C, versus T data are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) for selected samples for the sake of visual clarity. Anomalies associated with the onset of SC were observed in samples with x<0.45. Since Neel temperatures T_{\rm N} are below 1.8 K in the resistivity data, we performed low-temperature specific-heat measurements on samples with x=0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.5, 0.38, and 0.3, down to 0.5 K. In Fig. 5(c), the values of T_{\rm N} (indicated by red arrows) are suppressed with increasing Pr content until x\sim 0.38. These results are consistent with those from the resistivity data. A previous study on EuPt_{4}Ge_{12} by Nicklas _et al._[24] reported that EuPt_{4}Ge_{12} exhibits complex magnetic order at low temperature [indicated by black arrows in Fig. 5(c)]. It seems these additional transitions are suppressed with increasing Pr concentration for x=0.95, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7 at least; however, further investigations are needed, since the nature of this complex magnetic order has not yet been clarified.

The coefficients of the electronic and lattice contributions to the specific heat, \gamma and \beta, respectively, were determined using linear fits:

\[C(T)/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2},\] (4)

in the range from the lowest nonordered temperature to \sim 250 K^{2} (data not shown). In Fig. 6(a), the \gamma values first increase from \sim 45 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} at x=0 to \sim 76 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} at x=0.5 in the SC region and then increase more rapidly up to \sim 224 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}at x=1 in the Eu-rich region. Such different rates of increase in the \gamma values suggest that stronger electronic correlations or Eu^{2+} spin fluctuations, as reflected in the AFM nature of EuPt_{4}Ge_{12}[19, 22], are more clearly manifested in the Eu-rich region. The value we obtained for \gamma of PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} deviates from the values reported in other studies; however, this could be due to the different methods employed for determining \gamma values [3, 5, 11, 13, 14]. Even though the \gamma value for x=1 is about half of \gamma\sim 500 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} for PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}[31, 32], it is still a fairly large enhancement of \gamma; further research on EuPt_{4}Ge_{12} would be of interest. The Debye temperature, \Theta_{\rm D}, was obtained by using the relation \Theta_{\rm D}=[1944(n_{\rm f.u.}/\beta)]^{1/3} K, where n_{\rm f.u.}=17, the number of atoms in the formula unit. As seen in Fig. 6(b), \Theta_{\rm D} shows a small increase with increasing x.

Since the systematic upturns in specific heat at low temperature [see Fig. 5(b)] are simultaneously present with SC anomalies, our ability to determine the exact T_{\rm c} values is compromised. The electronic contribution to the specific heat, C_{\rm e}(T), was obtained by subtracting the phonon contribution, C_{\rm ph}(T)=\beta T^{3}, from the C(T) data. A log-log plot of C_{\rm e} versus

(b) The Meissner and diamagnetic shielding fractions 4\pi\,\chi_{\rm val} versus T for superconducting samples. The diamagnetic shielding fractions are close to 1. The deviations from unity are probably due to uncertainties in estimating the demagnetization factor. (c) Effective magnetic moment, obtained from the fit (\mu_{\rm eff}/\mu_{\rm B}) versus x; the value of \mu_{\rm eff}(x)/\mu_{\rm B} increases from \mu_{\rm eff}\sim 3.64\mu_{\rm B} at x=0 to \mu_{\rm eff}\sim 7.9\mu_{\rm B} at x=1. The red line is determined from a calculation by using Eq. (3). (d) Curie-Weiss temperature \Theta_{\rm CW} versus x. As x is increased, \Theta_{\rm CW} first increases to x\sim 0.5 and then decreases to x=1. The dashed lines are guides to the eye.

(c) C/T versus T data at low temperatures for Eu-rich compounds. The Néel temperature, T_{\rm N} are suppressed with increasing Pr content, as indicated by red arrows. The multiple magnetic transitions (black arrows) defined by Nicklas _et al._[30] are shown as a reference.

  T in Fig. 6(c) shows that the upturns in C(T) have a power-law type divergence; the values of the slopes scatter around \sim-1. Therefore, we subtracted this upturn in C(T) from the data by using the relation

\[C(T)=\gamma\,T+\beta\,T^{3}+p\,T^{-q},\] (5)

where p and q are the fitting parameters. First, we fixed the \gamma and \beta values obtained from linear fits by using Eq. (4) and performed least-squares fits of Eq. (5) to the data in order to determine p and q values and subtract only the upturn from the data. An example for Pr_{0.8}Eu_{0.2}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is displayed in Fig. 6(d). The fitting parameter q scattered between \sim 0.8 and \sim 1.1, consistent with the observation in Fig. 6(c). The SC anomalies after subtraction of the upturns are shown as a plot of C_{a}/T versus T in Fig. 6(e), showing a systematic decrease of T_{\rm c}, consistent with results obtained from resistivity and magnetization data. However, we did not observe clear features of SC for the x=0.45 and 0.5 samples, possibly due to broad superconducting transitions and low T_{\rm c} values.

Figure 7 displays semilogarithmic plots of C_{e}/\gamma\,T_{\rm c} versus T_{\rm c}/T for Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} up to x=0.3. The fits to the data were performed in the range 1\leq T_{\rm c}/T\leq T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm min}, where T_{\rm min} is the lowest temperature available in the data. The red lines in Figs. 7(a)-7(c) show that the compounds with x\leq 0.1 are best described by the power-law formula b(T_{\rm c}/T)^{-m}, where b and m are the fitting parameters, whose values are listed in Fig. 7. This power-law temperature dependence suggests multiband superconductivity or nodes in the gap function in these compounds [5]. In the case of nodes in the gap structure, it is intriguing to note that such a change in m values from \sim 3 to \sim 2 may suggest that the gap structure evolves from point-like to line nodes [33]. In Figs. 7(d)-7(f), the blue lines are the fits of an exponential temperature dependence ae^{-\Delta/T_{\rm c}}, where a is a fitting parameter and \Delta is the SC energy gap; these values are listed in Figs. 7(d)-7(f). These results suggest that the compounds with x\geq 0.15 exhibit single-band isotropic s-wave SC.

Similar crossovers or changes from power-law to exponential temperature dependence in C(T) the superconducting state were observed in previous studies for the Pr(Os_{1-x}Ru_{x})_{4}Sb_{12}, Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, La_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12}, and PrPt_{4}Ge_{12-x}Sb_{x} systems [12; 13; 34; 35]. A possible explanation for this change is a crossover in the superconducting energy gap from point nodes to nodeless structures, or a suppression of one or more superconducting energy gaps in a multiband superconductor [5; 10; 11; 33]. Recently, low-temperature specific-heat measurements on Pr_{1-x}Ce_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} suggest the presence of both a nodal and a nodeless gap on different parts of the Fermi surface in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, which are suppressed with different rates upon increasing Ce substitutions [14]. This scenario would be another explanation for the noninteger values of m in the x=0.05 and 0.1 data and the low-temperature upturns or deviations from the linear fits for the x=0.15 and 0.2 samples. However, the latter deviations could also be due to the fact that

Dashed lines are guides to the eye. (c) A systematic increase of the upturn in C(T) at low temperature is displayed as a log-log plot of the electronic specific-heat contribution, C_{\rm c} versus T.

The red and blue lines represent the best fits to the data with (a)–(c) power-law behavior b(T_{\rm c}/T)^{-m}, and (d)–(f) exponential behavior ae^{-\Delta/T_{\rm c}}, respectively.

  the values of \Delta\,/\,T_{\rm c} could vary depending on the fitting range [36]. More detailed studies of low-temperature specific heat on the \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} system are underway. These studies will be able to discriminate between these different scenarios and will reveal the nature of the superconducting order parameters and their evolution with Eu concentration.

## IV Discussion

Figure 8 summarizes the results from \rho(T), \chi_{\rm vol}(T), and C(T) measurements in a temperature, T, versus europium, x, (T-x), phase diagram. The SC transition temperature, T_{\rm c}, values were taken from the onset of diamagnetic signals in the \chi_{\rm vol}(T) data. For the C(T) measurements, T_{\rm c} was determined from the results of idealized entropy-conserving constructions [37, 38] (data not shown). The error bars were taken from the width of transitions in both resistivity and specific-heat data. These T_{\rm c} values estimated by different measurements exhibit a consistent trend in which SC is suppressed with negative curvature up to x\simeq 0.6. The suppression rate of T_{\rm c} for \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} is different compared with our previous substitution studies of \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Ce}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} and \text{Pr}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12-x}\text{Sb}_{x}, which show suppressions of T_{\rm c} with positive curvature [12, 13]. Since Eu ions have a stable divalent electronic state in the skutterudite structure [24], the crystalline electric field effects are expected to be absent. Thus, we could consider the effect on SC of substituting Eu^{+2} ions as similar to that of substituting Gd^{3+} for Pr. The monotonic change of our \mu_{\rm eff} data [see Fig. 4(c)] supports this scenario. Rare-earth impurities with stable valences are believed to exhibit ferromagnetic exchange interactions with a host superconductor (in this case, \text{Pr}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12}) wherein the depression of T_{\rm c} with paramagnetic impurity concentration is described by the Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) theory [39], as has been demonstrated for the \text{La}_{1-x}\text{Gd}_{x}\text{Al}_{2} system [40]. The negative curvature of T_{\rm c}(x) in this study seems to be consistent with the AG theory, compared with the results of the Ce substitution study, in which the depression of T_{\rm c} with x resembles the behavior expected for a system in which the paramagnetic impurities produce a Kondo effect in which the Kondo temperature is much larger than the SC transition temperature T_{\rm c}. On the other hand, the substitution of Eu^{2+} ions (hole doping), is different from that of Gd^{3+} (isoelectronic substitution). A nonisovalent mixture of Pr and Eu would probably affect T_{\rm c} in \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12}, since charge is transferred from the rare-earth guest ions to the host material. This would, in turn, change the Fermi level, which is one of crucial parameters that controls SC in the M\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} compounds, as reported in a previous study on the \text{BaPt}_{4-x}\text{Au}_{x}\text{Ge}_{12} system [41]. However, the doping into the Pr site may have a weaker effect on SC than doping into the Pt-Ge cage, since the Fermi surface of \text{Pr}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} is mainly composed of the Ge-4p orbitals with small contributions from the Pt-5d orbitals [7]. In the SC states of the \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} system, the situation is more complicated than in \text{La}_{1-x}\text{Gd}_{x}\text{Al}_{2}, as we observed evidence for a crossover in the SC energy gap from point-nodes to nodeless structures, or a suppression of one or more superconducting energy gaps in a multiband superconductor [5, 10, 11, 14, 33]. This crossover behavior is depicted by the color gradient below the T_{\rm c} versus x curve in Fig. 8.

The Neel temperatures T_{\rm N} were consistent between the \rho(T) and the low-temperature C(T) data. The \text{Pr}_{1-x}\text{Eu}_{x}\text{Pt}_{4}\text{Ge}_{12} system exhibits a crossover from SC to AFM states with increasing x and, more interestingly, a coexistence of those two states in the range of 0.2\simeq x\simeq 0.6. Such a coexistence of AFM and SC has been observed in other conventional and unconventional SC containing localized magnetic moments [42, 43, 44]. As recently suggested by Singh _et al._[14], our system seems to show that the nodal gap is being suppressed relatively slowly upon Eu substitution in the SC and coexistence regions compared with the rapid suppressions observed in previous reports [12, 13]. In the nonordered states, i.e., the high-temperature region, the system shows an evolution of the power dependence of the resistivity in the formula \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}, shown as a color contour plot in Fig. 8. The values of n change from n\sim 5 at Pr-rich sites to n\sim 2 (FL behavior) at x\sim 0.5, and then enters a NFL state with n\sim 1 at Eu-rich sites. Such FL to NFL transition is also manifested by small kinks observed in the resistivity data (see Fig. 3). In the specific-heat data, we did not observe a very clear logarithmic divergence (data not shown), C(T)/T\sim(-1/\,T_{0})\text{ln}(T/\,T_{0}), which is believed to be a nearly universal feature of NFL behavior in specific heat [45]; however, a weak power-law divergence could be also an indication for NFL behavior [45] and the divergence in specific heat could vary between different systems [46]. Therefore, we speculate that the rather large jumps in the specific heat for the Eu-rich compounds are possibly the combination of AFM transitions and the divergence due to the NFL behavior. However, there are other possible scenarios for the observed kinks in resistivity;

Figure 8: A plot of temperature, T, versus Eu concentration, x, (T-x), phase diagram. The vertical bars in the T_{\rm c}(x) data represent the widths of the superconducting transitions (see text). The suppression of T_{\rm c} with x has negative curvature and extrapolates to 0 K near x=0.6. The blue gradient-filled area under the T_{\rm c} versus x curve represents the change of the temperature-dependence of low-temperature specific heat, C_{\rm c}/\,\gamma T_{\rm c}=b(T_{\rm c}/\,T)^{-m} to ae^{-\beta/T_{\rm c}}. The Néel temperature T_{\rm N} decreases slowly from x=1 to x\simeq 0.38. SC and AFM may coexist in the region between x\simeq 0.2 and \simeq 0.6. The black circles with crosses are the temperatures T_{n}, where resistivity slopes have kinks as seen in Fig. 3(a). The color contour plot in the background displays the evolution of the power n values in the formula, \text{ln}(\rho(T)-\rho_{0})=\text{ln}(A_{n})+n\text{ln}(T).

  for example, subtle structural phase transitions, which have been reported in skutterudite-related systems [47].

Our study of Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} shows a complex phase diagram with SC to AFM and FL to NFL crossovers, suggesting that changes in the underlying electronic structure "tune" competing interactions in this system; this interpretation could be supported by the scenario of multiband type of SC with different energy gap structures in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}[9, 10, 11, 14]. Since there is no report of the GdPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound, it would be interesting to perform a substitution study of Pr_{1-x}Gd_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} as a comparative study with the current study. Subsequent studies of density functional theory (DFT) calculations on Pr_{1-x}(Eu,Gd)_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} would give us better understanding of the relationship of the electronic density of states (DOS) and paramagnetic impurities on the nature of unconventional SC in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}.

## V Concluding remarks

We studied the superconducting and normal-state properties of the unconventional superconductor PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, in which Eu has been substituted for Pr. Polycrystalline samples of Pr_{1-x}Eu_{x}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} were investigated via x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific-heat measurements. Upon Eu substitution, we observed a crossover from superconducting to antiferromagnetically ordered states with a region where superconductivity and antiferromagnetism may coexist. In the superconducting region, the specific-heat data exhibit a crossover of temperature dependence, suggesting a change from a nodal to a nodeless superconducting energy gap or suppression of multiband superconductivity. This crossover is relatively slower than previous reports of different substitution studies, suggesting paramagnetic impurities have a weaker pair-breaking effect on the unconventional superconductivity in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}. In the normal state, we observed a crossover from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior, accompanied by a coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, suggesting intrinsic electronic structures may be correlated with the complex physical phenomena in this system.
