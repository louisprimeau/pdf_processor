###### Abstract

We report the effect of 3 MeV proton irradiation on the suppression of
the critical temperature T_(c) in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ single
crystals at underdoping, optimal-doping, and overdoping levels. We find
that T_(c) decreases and residual resistivity increases monotonically
with increasing dose. We also find no upturn in low-temperature
resistivity in contrast with the α-particle-irradiated NdFeAs(O,F),
which suggests that defects induced by the proton irradiation behave as
nonmagnetic scattering centers. The critical scattering rate for all
samples estimated by three different ways is much higher than that
expected in s_(z)-pairing scenario based on interband scattering due to
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation.

Since the discovery of the high-T_(c) iron-based superconductors,[1]
extensive studies for the superconducting gap structure have been
performed because the gap structure is closely associated with the
pairing mechanism. Theoretically, fully gapped s-wave state with
opposite signs between different Fermi surfaces (s_(z) wave) has been
proposed.[2, 3] The fully opened gap is suggested by some experiments,
such as penetration depth measurements by microwave conductivity,[4, 5]
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),[6, 7] and thermal
conductivity.[8] However, whether the sign reversal is involved in the
multigap structure is questioned. While the inelastic neutron
measurements suggest _resonance peak_ in magnetic excitation spectra
χ^(′)(Q⃗, ω), which is observed when the sign of the gap takes opposite
values on different parts of the Fermi surface,[9, 10] it is pointed out
that such a hump structure of neutron-scattering intensity can be also
explained by even s₊₊ symmetry, which has the same sign of gaps on
different Fermi surfaces.[11] In addition, several studies on the
impurity effect indicate that the critical temperature T_(c) is robust
against the introduction of nonmagnetic impurities, which is strikingly
different from the suppression of T_(c) predicted in the s_(z) wave.[12,
13, 14] Hence, these results lead us to consider that s₊₊ symmetry
should be added to one of the possible candidates for the gap symmetry
of iron-based superconductors. Moreover, recent studies suggest that in
some iron-based superconductors, such as LaFePO,[15] KFe₂As₂,[16] and
BaFe₂(As,P),[17] the gap is nodal in a part of the Fermi surface. In
Co-doped BaFe₂As₂, it is reported that a fully opened gap structure
changes to a nodal one when the Co concentration increases from optimal
to overdoped region.[18] Further studies on the gap structure of
iron-based superconductors have been desired.

To elucidate the superconducting gap structure, a detailed study on the
effect of defects is very crucial because the pair-breaking effects due
to scattering centers are phase sensitive. The conventional way to
introduce impurities is chemical substitutions of constituent elements.
It is well known that isotropic s-wave superconductivity is robust
against nonmagnetic impurities due to Anderson’s theorem while
superconductivity with a sign change in the gap, such as d wave, is
sensitive to nonmagnetic impurities. However, chemical substitutions may
lead to inhomogeneity in the sample, change in carrier density and the
Fermi-surface topology, which can mask the intrinsic impurity effect.
Another way to introduce scattering centers is to create defects by the
swift particle irradiation. Among them, a light element irradiation,
such as proton and α particle, is very suitable for the study of
artificially introduced scattering centers, since the irradiation can
introduce point defects without providing inhomogeneity and changing
electronic structure. So far, for single crystals, only one group
reports α-particle irradiation experiments.[14] However, the irradiation
produces Kondo-type upturn in the resistivity due to spin-flip
scattering, which can mask the intrinsic nonmagnetic scattering effect
on the superconducting gap of iron-arsenide superconductors.

In this paper, we address the issue of the superconducting gap structure
in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ (x=0.045, 0.075, and 0.113) by detailed
study of pair-breaking effect introduced by proton irradiation. We find
monotonic increase in the resistivity with proton irradiation. The
upturn of resistivity at low temperatures is not observed, which
indicates that proton irradiation provides nonmagnetic scattering
centers. The suppression of T_(c) is weaker than the expectation for a
superconductor with sign-reversed gaps on/between the Fermi surfaces.

Single-crystalline samples of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ were grown by the
FeAs/CoAs self-flux method and their fundamental properties are reported
in Ref. [19]. A mixture with a ratio of Ba:FeAs/CoAs=1:5 was placed in
an alumina crucible. The whole assembly was sealed in a large silica
tube and heated up to 1150 ^(∘)C and kept there for 10 h followed by
slow cooling down to 800 ^(∘)C at a rate of 5 ^(∘)C/h, which is slightly
different from the synthesis reported before.[20] After cleaving, we can
obtain shiny samples. The typical dimensions of the resulting crystals
are 4 × 4 × 0.1 mm³. The average Co concentration in each batch was
determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy measurements. The 3
MeV protons, which are known to create from one to few tens of
displacements,[21] were irradiated into the samples at NIRS-HIMAC. The
irradiation was carried out at 40 K avoiding the thermal annealing
effect.[22] A total dose is 1.2×10¹⁶ cm⁻². To ensure the uniformity of
damage throughout the sample, we used samples with thicknesses of 15-30
μm, which is smaller than the projected range of  50 μm obtained from
the simulation using the stopping and range of ions in matter-2008.[23]
Resistivity measurements were performed _in situ_ after each irradiation
by standard four-probe configuration. Similar results are confirmed in 6
MeV proton irradiation.

Figure 1(a) shows x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the unirradiated
and irradiated Ba(Fe_(0.925)Co_(0.075))₂As₂ using Cu Kα₁ radiation. We
do not observe broadening of peaks for irradiated sample as shown in the
inset of Fig. 1(a), which strongly support that disorder is so small to
induce any structural changes. In addition, we confirm that no change in
the lattice parameter c by the irradiation obtained from XRD
measurements within experimental error. We note that these values are
very close to that reported by Ni _et al._ in Ref. [24] as shown in Fig.
1(b).

Figure 2 shows the resistivity of Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with x =
0.045, 0.075, and 0.113 as a function of temperature. With increasing
dose, T_(c) decreases monotonically without significant broadening of
the transition width while the resistivity increases monotonically. It
should be noted that in the α-particle-irradiated NdFeAs(O,F) Kondo-type
resistivity upturn at low temperatures is reported,[14] which is
associated with the spin-flip scattering due to magnetic impurities. In
contrast to the behavior in NdFeAs(O,F), no upturn is observed in the
resistivity of proton-irradiated Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂, which
strongly suggests that defects produced by the irradiation act as
nonmagnetic scattering centers. _We emphasize that only the contribution
of nonmagnetic scattering centers to the pair breaking enable us to
investi

of iron-arsenide superconductors._

Figure 3 shows the dose dependence of the normalized critical
temperature T_(c)/T_(c0) for Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂, where T_(c0) is
the transition temperature before the irradiation. T_(c0) obtained from
the midpoint of resistive transition are 15.1 K, 24.8 K, and 12.8 K for
x=0.045, 0.075, and 0.113, respectively. In all the samples,
T_(c)/T_(c0) decreases linearly with increasing the dose in the present
dose range. We note that the maximum dose of ∼1.2×10¹⁶ cm⁻² in the
present study is one fourth of that in the α-particle-irradiated
NdFeAs(O,F). Interestingly, in the underdoped and optimally doped
samples, the suppression of T_(c) is very small while in the overdoped
sample the suppression is large down to the half of T_(c0). We note that
stronger suppressions of T_(c) in overdoped samples are also reported in
Zn-doped LaFeAsO_(0.85)Sr_(0.15) (Ref. [25]) and LaFeAsO_(0.85).[26] The
increased residual resistivity by the irradiation Δρ₀ as a function of
dose is plotted in the inset of Fig. 3. Δρ₀ is the difference of the
residual resistivity between irradiated and unirradiated one, namely,
ρ₀=ρ₀^(tr) − ρ₀^(unirr), which corresponds to the density of defects
introduced by the proton irradiation. We evaluate the residual
resistivity ρ₀ by fitting the data using ρ=ρ₀+AT^(n), where α is an
exponent of temperature. We fix α as 2, 1, and 1.5 for x=0.045, 0.075,
and 0.113, respectively. Δρ₀ increases almost linearly with dose, which
ensures that the proton irradiation introduces defects systematically.

Figure 4 shows T_(c) as a function of Δρ₀ for Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂.
The suppression of T_(c) due to defects introduced by the irradiation is
almost linear for samples with all doping levels. The slope
dT_(c)/d(Δρ₀) is −0.08 K/μΩ cm, −0.13 K/μΩ cm, and −0.20 K/μΩ cm for
x=0.045, 0.075, and 0.113, respectively. These values are slightly
larger than the initial slope of the suppression in the
α-particle-irradiated NdFeAs(O,F), ∼−0.04 K/μΩ cm.

To discuss the pair-breaking effect due to nonmagnetic scattering
quantitatively, a key parameter is the normalized scattering rate
g=ℏ/2πg_(B)T_(c0)τ. Here, τ is the scattering time including both
intraband and interband scattering contributions. To avoid ambiguity of
estimation, we present g obtained from three different ways. In order to
obtain the elastic scattering rate introduced by the irradiation, we use
the relation τ⁻¹=ne²Δρ₀/m^(*)=eΔρ₀/m^(*)R_(H), where n is the carrier
number, R_(H) is Hall coefficient, and m^(*) is the effective mass.
Figure 5(a) shows T_(c)/T_(c0) as a function of
g^(H)=ℏ/2πg_(B)T_(c0)τ=ℏΔρ₀/2πg_(B)T_(c0)μ^(*)R_(H) for x=0.045, 0.075,
and 0.113. Assuming that electrons are dominant carriers, we use the
$R_{H}

  among them, \(g_{c}^{\mu}$ is much larger than expected g_(c)^(±) for
s_(z) scenario.

We show another way to estimate g_(c) based on the parameter obtained by
theoretical calculation. According to the linear-response theory based
on five-orbital model,[30, 31] we can obtain the relation Δρ₀ (μΩ cm) =
0.098r⁻¹ (K) in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ with interplane distance c =
6.5 A and n = 5.8-6.1. Figure 5(b) shows T_(c)/T_(c0) as a function of
g^(Soft)=zh/2 xg_(T).0τ= 1.632Δρ₀/T_(c0), where z=m/m^(*) is the
renormalization factor. We use z=1/3.5 obtained by ARPES (Ref. [28])
assuming m - m_(c). Obtained critical values g^(Soft) by linear
extrapolation are 6.1, 3.5, and 2.4 for x = 0.045, 0.075, and 0.113,
respectively, which are again much larger than g_(c)^(soft) for s_(z)
scenario. We note that the critical values g_(c)^(soft) obtained from
the parameter based on theoretical calculation is very similar to
g_(c)^(μ) obtained from experimental values of R_(H) and m^(*).

To obtain carrier number and effective mass indirectly, we use the
relation τ⁻¹=neeeΔ/m^(*)=Δρ/μΦλ, where λ is the penetration depth,
λ=$\mathrm{\sqrt{\mu}}$μσ/ne. Figure 5(c) shows T_(c)/T_(c0) as a
function of
$g^{\mathit{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{ \mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{ \mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{\mathrm{     \mathrm{        }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}$$\mathrm{\mathrm{\Phi}$λσΦλ.
Tunnel diode resonator measurements for Al-coated samples provides the
absolute values of penetration depths in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂,[32]
Above x=0.045, the absolute value of penetration depth is almost
independent of Co doping and is close to 200 nm with small scattering.
Therefore, we use the value of the penetration depth λ=200 nm for all
samples presented here. Obtained critical values g_(c)^(λ) by linear
extrapolation are 3.1, 1.8, and 1.2 for x=0.045, 0.075, and 0.113,
respectively. Although these values are roughly half of the previous two
estimations, they are more than three times larger than g_(c)^(±)
expected for s_(z) scenario.

Critical scattering rates obtained in the three different estimations in
the present study are larger than that expected for s_(z) scenario. It
should be emphasized that proton irradiation provides only nonmagnetic
scattering centers without changing electronic structure of
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂. Our present results definitely indicate that
iron-arsenide superconductor Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ is robust against
nonmagnetic scattering. The weak suppression of T_(c) in s_(z)-wave
superconductors could be understood by the details of scattering
potential. Strikingly suppressed interband scattering introduced by the
irradiation, which is rather unlikely in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂, with
both electron and hole pockets having d_(xz) and d_(yz) orbital
characters, could explain the weak pair breaking. Further detailed
theoretical model to understand the nontrivial weak suppression of T_(c)
in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ should be required.

Finally we comment on the possibility of change in the gap structure
with doping level in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂. Thermal-conductivity
measurements suggest the existence of nodes in overdoped sample.[18] The
stronger suppression of T_(c) in overdoped sample than underdoped and
optimally doped ones may suggest the different gap structures, for
instance, nodal s_(z)-wave symmetry,[33] where the order parameter has
d-wavelike nodes on the electron Fermi surface while others are fully
open, or s_(z) wave with _accidental_ horizontal nodes.[18]

In summary, we present the suppression of T_(c) by defects introduced by
3 MeV proton irradiation in Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂ single crystals
with different doping levels. We find that T_(c) decreases and residual
resistivity increases monotonically. No Kondo-type upturn in the
low-temperature resistivity is observed which suggests that defects
created by the irradiation act as nonmagnetic scattering centers. The
critical scattering rates obtained from the three different estimations
are much larger than that expected in s_(z) scenario, which may
contradict the theoretical expectation based on interpocket scattering
due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations.
