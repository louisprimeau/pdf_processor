###### Abstract

We report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in the ternary intermetallics YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3}. High-quality single crystals were grown via the Sn-flux method and studied using magnetization, specific-heat, and resistivity measurements at low temperatures. The critical temperatures obtained from these different techniques are in very good agreement and yield T_{\rm c}=1.36(3) K and T_{\rm c}=1.61(2) K for YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3}, respectively. Magnetization measurements indicate that both compounds are among the rare cases where type-I superconductivity occurs in a ternary intermetallic, however, the jump in the specific heat at the transition is lower than the value expected from BCS theory (\Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{\rm g}T_{\rm c}=1.43) in both materials and is equal to 1.14(9) and 0.71(5) for the Y and Lu compounds, respectively. Resistive measurements exhibit sharp transitions but with critical fields \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0) (\approx0.05 T for YNiSi_{3}) and \approx0.08 T for LuNiSi_{3}) considerably higher than those obtained from the magnetization and specific heat (\approx0.01 T). First-principles density functional theory calculated electronic structure shows that these compounds have highly anisotropic and complex Fermi surfaces with one electronic and two holelike branches. One hole branch and the electron branch have a large cylindrical topology connecting the first Brillouin-zone boundaries, the former being built up by the hybridization of Y(Lu) d, Ni d, and Si p states, and the latter being built up by Ni d and Si p states. The calculated phononic structures indicate that the coupling of the Y(Lu), Ni d, and Si p electrons in the low-lying optical phonon branches is responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs and the observed superconducting state. Therefore, these compounds can be classified as anisotropic three-dimensional metals with multiband superconducting ground states in the weak-coupling regime.

## I Introduction

The search for new superconductors (SCs) has, in the past decade, often focused on heavy-fermion materials and/or materials whose unit cells lack a center of inversion--the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) superconductors [1]. This is because these materials are thought to be good candidates for unconventional superconductors, which do not conform to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [2, 3, 4, 5] and can exhibit high critical fields--on the order of a few teslas--as well as high critical temperatures. Despite the large number of reported studies, the relationship between a material's crystal structure and its superconducting properties is not yet firmly established. Therefore, it is essential to explore unusual features of centrosymmetric superconductors in order to unravel the role of crystalline structure _per se_. In the same way, the study of compounds with weak electron correlations, such as Sc-, Y-, La-, and Lu-based SCs, can enhance our comprehension of heavy-fermion SCs.

Superconductors are traditionally categorized into type I or II, according to the transition of the superconducting phase to the normal state under an applied magnetic field: type-I SCs have a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa<1/\sqrt{2} and undergo a first-order transition into the superconducting state in a magnetic field, whereas type-II SCs present a second-order phase transition and \kappa>1/\sqrt{2}. The ratio \kappa=\lambda/\xi connects the two length parameters yielded by the GL equations: the GL penetration depth \lambda and the superconducting coherence length \xi. Within this classification, type-I superconductivity is normally displayed by elemental SCs, e.g., Pb, Hg, and Sn, although several exceptions have been found, such as the binary compounds CaBi_{2}[6], KBi_{2}[7], ScGa_{3}, LuGa_{3}[8], YbSb_{2}[9], and PdTe_{2}[10], the ternary cage compound LaTi_{2}Al_{20}[11], and the NCS LaPdSi_{3}[12], and LaIrSi_{3}[13].

Whereas the vast majority of superconducting binary and ternary intermetallic compounds are of type II, increasing numbers of materials have been found with intermediate behaviors. Therefore, type-II SCs were further classified into types-II/1 (\kappa\approx 1/\sqrt{2}), -II/2 (traditional type-II \kappa>1/\sqrt{2}) [14], and -1.5 (\kappa\gg 1/\sqrt{2}) [15, 16, 17]. Some examples of type II/1 are Nb [18], ZrB_{12}[19, 20], and the noncentrosymmetric superconductors AuBe [21], RhGe [22], and LaRhSi_{3}[23, 24, 25, 26]. Type-1.5 SCs may include MgB_{2}[15, 16, 17] and Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[27].

In the NiGe_{3} (R= Y, Ce) (where R represents rare earth) series [28, 29] with a centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure, the compounds YNiGe_{3}[30] and CeNiGe_{3}[31, 32, 33] are superconductors. The former has an unusually low specific heat jump at the transition compared to the prediction of BCS theory [30], whereas the latter is an unconventional heavy-fermion superconductor under pressure.

 In this paper, we present a detailed characterization of two nonmagnetic compounds of the _R_NiSi_{3} series (those with R = Y, Lu) expected to show many of the same features as YNiGe_{3} with _T_c = 0.46 K [30]. We report on the discovery, via resistivity, magnetization, and specific-heat measurements, of bulk type-I superconductivity in single crystals of YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} with critical temperatures _T_c = 1.36(3) K for YNiSi_{3} and _T_c = 1.61(2) K for LuNiSi_{3}. We also present density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the electronic properties of these compounds.

## II Methods

YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} single crystals were synthesized via the Sn-flux method originally used to grow YbNiSi_{3}[34]. A proportion of 1:1:3:45 (Y/Lu:Ni:Si:Sn) was used as detailed in previous work [35] wherein the crystalline structures were verified by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis and wavelength dispersive electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) of the single crystals, conducted in a JEOL JXA-8200 microanalyzer. The crystal compositions were determined by averaging over ten different points of a polished sample.

Resistivity between 0.04 and 4 K was measured with a standard four-probe ac method in a homemade system inside a commercial Cambridge Magnetic Refrigeration mFridge mF-ADR50 with applied magnetic fields in two orientations: parallel or perpendicular to the crystal plate main surfaces. Specific heat between 0.37 and 5 K was measured on crystals with total mass of about 7 mg, under applied fields parallel to the plates, using the 2t thermal relaxation method in the Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System.

Magnetic susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System magnetometer with an iQuantum ^{3}He insert--in this case, the field was perpendicular to the plate surfaces. Proper evaluation of the magnetization measurements in SCs must take into account the demagnetization factor (_N_) due to the sample shape since the volumetric susceptibility of a bulk SC must approach \chi\sim-1 below the critical temperature. In our case, the platelike shape of the crystal made it simple to estimate _N_~0.5 for YNiSi_{3} and _N_~0.7 for LuNiSi_{3} with the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the main surface of the sample (_H_ || _b_).

Spin-polarized first-principles DFT calculations, including spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a second-variational scheme, have been carried out using the full-potential augmented-plane wave method with local orbitals (FP-APW + lo) as implemented in the elk code [36]. For the exchange-correlation energy functional, we have used the generalized gradient approximation and its PBEsol parametrization [37]. The muffin-tin (MT) radii of Y, Lu, Ni, and Si are set to R_{\rm MT}^{\rm N}=2.7777,~R_{\rm MT}^{\rm La}=2.7495,~R_{\rm MT}^{\rm N}= 2.0563,~R_{\rm MT}^{\rm Si}=2.0563 a.u., respectively. The parameter R_{\rm MT}|\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{k}|_{\rm max} governing the number of plane waves in the FP-APW + lo method is chosen to be 9.5. The Brillouin zone (BZ) is sampled with a uniformly spaced **k** grid of 8 x 8 x 8 for the structural relaxation and 16 x 16 x 16 for the calculation of the dispersion relation _E_(**k**), the total and site projected densities of states (DOS) and the Fermi surface (FS).

## III Experimental Results

Previous work on the series _R_NiSi_{3}[35] showed, by PXRD analysis, that these compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic space group _Cmmm_. The experimental lattice constants are given in Table I of the Supplemental Material [38]. Elemental analysis using EPMA revealed average sample compositions of Y_{0.96(1)}Ni_{1.00(19)}Si_{3.00(18)} and Lu_{1.00(1)}Ni_{0.68(2)}Si_{3.13(2)} with an upper limit of ~500 ppm Sn impurities in both crystals. LuNiSi_{3} crystals thus perform with significant Ni vacancies, as observed in the _R_NiGe_{3} series [28]. This effect is small for YNiGe_{3} but is more pronounced for heavier rare earths as in the case of LuNiGe_{3}. There were some small NiSi_{2} crystallites attached to the surface of the crystals (a diamagnetic non-superconducting metallic silicide [39, 40, 41]) that could be easily removed by polishing. Besides Sn (_T_c = 3.7 K), no other superconducting impurity was detected, so we may claim that the superconducting transitions presented below are due to these new intermetallic compounds.

In the following sections, we describe the characteristics of the superconductivity in YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} through magnetization, specific-heat, and resistivity experiments.

### YNiSi_{3}

Figure 1 shows the magnetic characterization of YNiSi_{3}._kh_(_T_) [Fig. 1(a)] was measured under an applied field of m0_H_ = 2 mT following a zero-field-cooled warming protocol. At 1.31(2) K, there is a relatively sharp transition with _kh_ rising from the value of -1 s expected by the complete field expulsion of a bulk SC. Figure 1(b) shows the _M_(_H_) curves at several temperatures below the superconducting transition. They are marked by a type-I SC behavior with M = -_H_ at low fields and an abrupt jump at _H_c. The transition in some type-I SC can be broadened by the presence of impurities, inhomogeneities, and even a high demagnetization effect, however the type-I behavior of this sample is very clear, attesting to the quality of the crystal.

The critical fields extracted from the curves in Fig. 1(b) were used to plot the phase diagram displayed in Fig. 1(c). The points were fitted by the empirical parabolic law [42],

\[H_{\rm c}(T)=H_{\rm c}(0)\Bigg{[}1-\left(\frac{T}{T_{\rm c}}\right)^{2}\Bigg{]},\] (1)

yielding an estimated critical field m0_H_c(0) = 9.6(2) mT.

Figure 2(a) shows the dependence of the total heat-capacity (_C_p) on T for YNiSi_{3} at zero field and with H ranging from 5 mT up to 1 T, a field well above that in which the superconductivity is suppressed. At zero field, there is a jump at 1.35(5) K, agreeing with the bulk superconductivity observed in the magnetization measurements. The data also seem to show a double peak, which could be a sign of a double transition over a narrow temperature range, but the resolution is not sufficient to allow a definitive conclusion. For the curves measured under applied fields, the transition temperature shifts to lower T with values comparable to the critical temperatures observed in Fig. 1(b). The jumps in _C_p(_T_) in 5 and 6 mT are higher than in zero field, suggesting a first-order transition for H  0. Figure 2(b) shows the dependence of _C_p/_T_ with T for the same data displayed in

 Fig. 2(a), whereas the inset shows C_{\rm p}/T vs T^{2} measured with \mu_{0}H=300 mT. The normal-state C_{\rm p} was fit with the expression C_{\rm p}(T)/T=\gamma_{\rm N}+\beta T^{2}+BT^{4} where the first term is due to the electronic contribution and the \beta T^{2}+BT^{4} terms describe the phonon contribution following the Debye model. The fit yields \gamma_{\rm N}=4.04(9) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2},\ \beta=0.0961(5) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4}, and B=0.0090(5) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-6}. The Debye temperature can be evaluated using

\[\theta_{\rm D}=\left(\frac{n12\pi^{4}R}{5\beta}\right)^{1/3},\] (2)

The inset shows C_{\rm p}/T vs T^{2} for a larger range of temperature. (c) Electronic contribution of specific heat for H=0 with the fits obtained with the models given in Eqs. (5) and (6).

(b) M(H) curves at several temperatures below the superconductor transition. (c) H_{\rm c} vs T phase diagram with each H_{\rm c}(T) value extracted from the curves in (b) and the fit made using Eq. (1).

  where n = 5 is the number of atoms per formula unit and R is the molar gas constant, yielding \theta_{\text{D}} = 466(9) K. The values of \gamma_{\text{N}} and \theta_{\text{D}} are comparable to those obtained in the previous work at high temperatures \gamma_{\text{N}} = 4.1\text{ mJ mol}^{-1}\text{ K}^{-2} and \theta_{\text{D}} = 393 K [35]. The density of states at the Fermi-level [_N_(_EF_)] is obtained using the relation,

\[N(E_{\text{F}}) = \frac{3\gamma_{\text{N}}}{\pi^{2}k_{\text{B}}^{2}N_{\text{A}}},\]

where _k_B is the Boltzmann constant and _N_A is the Avogadro number, resulting in _N_(_EF_) = 1.71 states/eV f.u. The electron-phonon coupling constant _l_e-ph is calculated using McMillan's formula [43],

\[\lambda_{\text{e-ph}} = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln(\theta_{\text{D}}/1.45T_{\text{c}})}{(1-0.62\mu^{*})\ln(\theta_{\text{D}}/1.45T_{\text{c}})-1.04},\]

where _m_* is usually taken between 0.1 and 0.15. Using a _m_* of 0.125 yields _l_e-ph = 0.43(2) placing YNiSi3 in the weak-coupling regime together with the NCS LaPdSi3 [12], (_l_e-ph = 0.51) LaRhSi3 [24] (_l_e-ph = 0.5), and Th7Fe3 (_l_e-ph = 0.59) [44]. It should be noted that McMillan's formula works better for pure metals because the Debye temperature is not properly defined in compounds containing elements with such large differences in their atomic masses.

Figure 2(c) shows the electronic heat-capacity (_C_el), obtained by subtracting the \beta T^{3} + BT^{5} terms from the zero-field data. For a BCS superconductor, the jump of \Delta C_{\text{el}} is expected to have an _s_-wave gap with \Delta C_{\text{el}}/\gamma_{\text{N}}T_{\text{c}} = 1.43; however, the estimated value for this compound is 1.14(9), significantly lower than expected. This has also been observed for the ternary type-I SC LaIrSi3 [13] and for the similar compound YNiGe3 [30]; in both cases, it was hypothesized that such a low value of the specific-heat jump is related to a large anisotropy in the superconducting gap.

We have tested four different models to fit the _C_el data in the superconducting regime: a single-gap a model for a BCS SC (_C_el^SG), a double-gap a model (_C_el^DG), a single-gap a model with a contribution from a nonsuperconducting fraction (_C_S  current, so a discussion on the presence of any anisotropic magnetoresistance effects is left for future work.

At zero field, there is a sharp transition at 1.42(2) K with \rho(T) quickly reaching zero even with a highest available data point density. The residual resistivity before the superconducting transition is \rho_{0}=0.33(3)\mu\Omega cm, obtained by averaging the values estimated in both directions, and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR), already published [35], is 54(5). With increasing magnetic field, there is very little broadening of the transition, however, for H higher than 20 mT, the transition is no longer complete. Comparison of Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) indicates that there is an important anisotropy with the configuration displayed in Fig. 3(b) showing higher T_{\text{c}} for the same H and a complete superconducting transition even under the presence of an applied field of 40 mT. Measuring down to 40 mK allows the observation of a partial transition under fields as high as 0.15 T in the configuration shown in Fig. 3(b). The critical fields obtained with these measurements are considerably higher than those observed in the magnetization and specific-heat measurements. We will return to this point in the Discussion section.

The thermodynamic quantities related to the first-order superconducting transition can be evaluated using the zero-field electronic specific-heat data displayed in Fig. 2(c). The equations below give the relationship between the internal energy (\Delta U), latent heat (T\Delta S), free energy (\Delta F), and critical field [H_{\text{c}}(T)] and how we can evaluate them from the specific-heat data,

\[\begin{split}\Delta F(T)&=-\frac{\mu_{0}VH_{\text{c }}^{2}(T)}{2}=\Delta U-T\ \Delta S,\\ \Delta U(T)&=\int_{T}^{T_{\text{c}}}[C_{\text{s}}(T^ {\prime})-C_{\text{n}}(T^{\prime})]dT^{\prime},\\ \Delta S(T)&=\int_{T}^{T}\frac{C_{\text{s}}(T^{\prime })-C_{\text{n}}(T^{\prime})}{T^{\prime}}dT^{\prime},\end{split}\] (7)

where V is the volume of a formula unit. Figure 4(a) shows the dependence of \Delta U, T\Delta S, and \Delta F with temperature for YNiSi_{3}. The dependence of H_{\text{c}}(T) obtained with this method is displayed in Fig. 4(b) and yields a critical field \mu_{0}H_{\text{c}}(0) of 7.0(7) mT, lower than the one obtained from magnetization [Fig. 1(c)]. Along with this curve, we display, in Fig. 4(b), the behavior of H_{\text{c}}(T) for YNiSi_{3} obtained with the experimental

Figure 4: (a) Temperature dependence of the internal energy difference (\Delta U), latent heat (T\Delta S), and free-energy (\Delta F) for YNiSi_{3}. These curves were calculated using the specific-heat measurements at zero field and Eq. (7). (b) Temperature dependence of the critical field H_{\text{c}}(T) obtained from different techniques: using the free energy shown in (a) and the specific-heat, magnetization, and resistivity measurements as a function of the applied field.

  results presented above, including the data shown in Fig. 1(c). The values of H_{\text{c}} and T_{\text{c}} resulting from the \rho(T) curves were obtained taking the temperature corresponding to a decrease in 50% of \rho_{0}, and we disregarded the curves that did not reach zero resistivity, although the transitions can be observed with fields as high as 150 mT. Despite all the results pointing to type-I superconductivity, it is notable that the critical fields obtained from resistivity with configuration H\perp b are about eight times higher at low temperatures compared to the other techniques. This could be an effect of surface superconductivity that only \rho(T) can probe, but as it is highly anisotropic, it seems a robust effect.

The techniques discussed above allow us to obtain the basic superconducting parameters for YNiSi_{3}. The electron-density n can be calculated considering the contribution of the three electrons from Y^{3+} and the presence of four formula units per unit cell of the compound (Z=4), yielding n=12/V_{\text{cell}}=3.70\times 10^{28} m^{-3}, where V_{\text{cell}}=324.49 A^{3} for YNiSi_{3}[35]. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, k_{\text{F}} is given by k_{\text{F}}\equiv(27\pi)^{1/3} which leads to an effective mass m^{+}=\hbar^{2}k_{\text{F}}^{2}\gamma_{\text{N}}/\pi^{2}nk_{\text{B}}^{2}=1.54 m_{0}, where m_{0} is the free-electron mass and \gamma_{\text{N}} is in volume units [the density of YNiSi_{3} is 4.7459(2) g/cm^{3}]. The mean free path is given by l=\hbar k_{\text{F}}/ne^{2}\rho_{0}=347 nm. The London penetration depth \lambda_{\text{L}} can be estimated from the relation \lambda_{\text{L}}=(m^{*}/\mu_{0}ne^{2})^{1/2} and is equal to 34(3) nm. Finally, the BCS coherence length in the clean limit is \xi_{0}=0.18\hbar^{2}k_{\text{F}}/k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}m^{*}=780(80) nm. Using the relations \lambda_{\text{GL}}=\lambda_{\text{L}}(1+0.75\xi_{0}/1)^{1/2}/\sqrt{2} and \xi_{\text{GL}}=0.74\xi_{0}(1+0.75\xi_{0}/1)^{-1/2} for T=0[49], we obtain \kappa=\lambda_{\text{GL}}/\xi_{\text{GL}}=0.113(11). This value puts YNiSi_{3} in the type-I limit since \kappa<1/\sqrt{2}, in line with the results from the previous measurements.

### LuNiSi_{3}

The superconducting properties of LuNiSi_{3} are very similar to YNiSi_{3}, but the superconductivity occurs at a higher critical temperature [T_{\text{c}}=1.61(2) K]. As the ionic radius of Lu^{3+} is smaller than Y^{3+}, LuNiSi_{3} has a smaller unit-cell volume than YNiSi_{3}, confirmed by previous x-ray analysis [35]. This increase in T_{\text{c}} may be a consequence of a chemical pressure effect from the reduced volume, making these compounds good candidates for subsequent low-temperature pressure studies.

Figure 5 shows the magnetic measurements for LuNiSi_{3} after taking into account the demagnetization factor correction.\chi(T) displayed in Fig. 5(a) was collected using a ZFC-FCW protocol with an applied field of \mu_{0}H=1 mT perpendicular to the plate (H\parallel b). The transition occurs at 1.58(2) K with \chi(T) approaching -1 at low temperatures. The M(H) curves displayed in Fig. 5(b), at several temperatures below T_{\text{c}}, present the same features of a type-I SC observed for YNiSi_{3}. A fit of the experimental critical field points in the phase diagram [Fig. 5(c)] using Eq. (1) yields \mu_{0}H_{\text{c}}(0)=10.4(2) mT.

The dependence of the specific heat on T at several applied fields for LuNiSi_{3} is presented in Fig. 6. Figure 6(a) shows a sharp transition at 1.63(2) K in zero field due to the superconducting transition. The transition shifts to lower temperatures with an increasing applied field as expected. The main panel in Fig. 6(b) shows the curve C_{\text{p}}/T vs T, whereas the inset shows C_{\text{p}}/T vs T^{2} measured

(b) M(H) curves at several temperatures below the superconductor transition. (c) Phase diagram with H_{\text{c}} extracted from the curves in panel (b) and the fit of Eq. (1).

  with \mu_{0}H=9 mT and the fit above the superconducting transition. The value of \gamma_{\text{N}}=3.97(9) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} was found (slightly below that for YNiSi_{3}) yielding a jump of \Delta C_{\text{el}}/\gamma_{\text{N}}T_{\text{c}}=0.71(5) also below the value expected from BCS theory. The experimentally estimated Debye temperature was 474(8) K [\beta=0.0910(5) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4} and B=0.000\,44(9) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-6}], similar to the previous work at high temperatures (484 K) [35]. The value of the electron-phonon coupling constant following Eq. (4) is \lambda_{\text{e-ph}}=0.44(2) also placing LuNiSi_{3} in the weak-coupling regime. The density of states at the Fermi level is, following Eq. (3), N(E_{\text{F}})=1.69 states/eV f.u.

Figure 6(c) shows C_{\text{el}} vs T in the superconducting regime and fits using the models described in Eqs. (5) and (6). The fit parameters are given in Table II. The results are very similar to YNiSi_{3}, and it is not possible to determine which compound has a larger superconducting gap.

Resistivity measurements for LuNiSi_{3} (Fig. 7) were conducted in the same configurations used for YNiSi_{3}. A sharp transition at 1.63(2) K takes place in zero field, and significant anisotropy is observed comparing Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) with the higher critical fields occurring for the geometry with H\perp b in the same way as YNiSi_{3}. In Fig. 7(b), a complete transition occurs up to 80 mT. The residual resistivity before

  the superconducting transition for this compound is \rho_{0} = 1.8(3) \mu\Omega cm and RRR = 38(4) [35].

We performed the same thermodynamic analysis using Eq. (7) for LuNiSi_{3}, and results are displayed in Fig. 8(a). Overall, the energies and latent heat curves for both compounds are very similar but reach higher absolute values for LuNiSi_{3}. Figure 8(b) shows the H_{\text{c}}(T) curve obtained using Eq. (7) and the data from Fig. 8(a) with a critical field of about 8.3 mT and the H_{\text{c}}(T) curves obtained with the experimental results presented above. As for YNiSi_{3}, the H_{\text{c}}(T) curves for LuNiSi_{3} obtained from magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity with H\parallel b are very similar, whereas the curve with H\perp b in the resistivity gives much higher critical fields.

Following the same analysis used for YNiSi_{3}, the electron density of LuNiSi_{3} yields n=3.83\times 10^{28} m^{-3} with V_{\text{cell}}=313.62 A^{3}[35]. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, the effective mass is m^{*}=1.51m_{0} [the density of LuNiSi_{3} is 6.5696(3) g/cm^{3}], the estimated mean free path is equal to l=63 nm, lower than for YNiSi_{3}, and the London penetration depth is 33(3) nm. Finally, the BCS coherence length in the clean limit is \xi_{0}=690(70) nm, and using the equations above for \lambda_{\text{GL}} and \xi_{\text{GL}}, we obtain \kappa=0.42(4). This value also puts LuNiSi_{3} in the type-I limit but much closer to the borderline value of 0.707.

## IV IV. Theoretical results

Since Ni is commonly a magnetic ion, we first checked for the possibility of magnetic order by starting from different spin configurations [including Y(Lu) and Ni atoms with parallel spins, Y(Lu) and Ni atoms with antiparallel spins for each sublattice, etc.], but all starting configurations converged to a nonmagnetic ground state with zero local magnetic moments, i.e., diamagnetic compounds are obtained. These results are compatible with the magnetic measurements reported previously [35] and with the results presented in the Experimental Results section of this paper.

Having established the magnetic configuration of these compounds, we have studied their crystallographic properties. The crystal structure of RNiSi_{3} has a base-centered orthorhombic centrosymmetric space-group Cmmm where the R = (Y, Lu) and the Ni atoms are located at the Wyckoff positions 4j (m2m) and 4i (m2m), respectively. There are three inequivalent Si atoms, two of them situated at positions 4i and one at 4j. The crystal structure is shown in Fig. 9(a), and the calculated and experimental lattice constants are shown in Table 1 of the Supplemental Material [38]. The optimization of the Wyckoff positions and lattice vectors shows the same crystal symmetry for all calculated volumes. Comparing our results for the equilibrium volumes with the available experimental data, the absolute error for the lattice constants is less than 1% for both compounds, whereas absolute errors in the volume are 1.71% and 1.56% for YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3}, respectively. Another important finding is deduced from the calculated vibrational dispersion relation at the equilibrium volumes where there are no imaginary frequencies, and therefore, the dynamical stability of the crystal structure of these compounds is maintained.

In order to understand the bonding properties of these crystalline materials, we have also calculated the ELF which gives a sound basis for a well-defined classification of bonds [50,51]. According to the ELF construction, this function can take values between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to perfect localization and 0.5 corresponds to the case of a homogeneous electron gas. Then, pure ionic bonding should manifest as high values of the ELF close to the nuclei and very low values (\sim0) uniformly distributed in the interstitial region. Pure covalent bonding between two atoms should display a local maximum of the ELF on the line connecting those atoms with a typical maximum value of the ELF in the range between 0.6 and 1.0, depending on how strong the bond is. Metallic bonding, which represents an intermediate case between the covalent bonding and ionic bonding, usually shows an almost uniform ELF distribution in the interstitial region with typical values on the order of 0.3-0.6. Figure 9(b) presents our calculated ELF for YNiSi_{3}. We have chosen three sections to display the ELF, namely, the NiSi_{2} and YSi layers, i.e., the (001) and (002) planes, and a section through all three atoms: the (101) plane.

Figure 8: (a) Temperature dependence of the internal energy difference (Δ_U_), latent heat (_T_Δ_S_), and free energy (Δ_F_) for LuNiSi_{3}. These curves were calculated using the specific-heat measurements at zero field and Eq. (7). (b) Temperature dependence of the critical field H_{\text{c}}(T) obtained from different techniques: using the free energy shown in (a) and using the specific-heat, magnetization, and resistivity measurements as a function of the applied field.

  The ELF values on (001) indicate that the bond between the Si atoms forming dimers along [010] is covalent (maximum value of 0.95) and stronger than the also covalent bond (maximum value of 0.82) between the Si atoms that build up the zigzag chain along [100]. On the other hand, the ELF values found in the regions connecting Ni-Si atoms reveal the metallic character of these bonds (maximum value of 0.48). On the (002) plane, the ELF functions (maximum value of 0.95) corroborate the covalent nature of the bonds of the Si dimers along [010], whereas the bonding between the Y and the Si atoms is metallic (maximum value of 0.51). Observing the ELF between the Y atoms that build the isosceles triangle on (002), we can deduce the bonding is ionic (maximum value of 0.21). Finally, the calculated ELF on (101) shows the weakly metallic behavior of the Y-Ni bond (maximum value of 0.32). To summarize, all types of chemical bonds can be distinguished in the YNiSi3 system: ionic (between Y atoms), metallic (among Ni-Si, Y-Si, and Ni-Y), and covalent (within the Si dimers and zigzag chains). We do not show the calculated ELF for LuNiSi3 because it is very similar to YNiSi3 and, consequently, the bonding properties are the same.

We have also calculated the elastic constants (see Table II of the Supplemental Material [38]) and then the Debye temperature using the following equation:

\[\Theta_{\text{D}} = \frac{\hbar sq_{\text{D}}}{k_{\text{B}}},\]

where s = (\frac{1}{3s_{i}^{2}} + \frac{2}{3s_{i}^{2}})^{- 1/3} is the average sound velocity, s_{l} = \sqrt{\frac{B + \{G\}}{\rho}} is the longitudinal sound velocity, s_{t} = \sqrt{\frac{G}{\rho}} is the transverse sound velocity, G is the isotropic shear modulus which is calculated in terms of the crystalline lattice constants q_{\text{D}} = \sqrt[3]{6\pi^{2}\eta_{a}}, and \eta_{a} is the atomic concentration. The calculated values are 497 and 464 K for YNiSi3 and LuNiSi3 with absolute relative errors of 6.7 and 2.1%, in good agreement with the experimental values.

For a better understanding of the basic electronic properties that may lead to the experimentally observed behavior of YNiSi3 and LuNiSi3, we now present the calculated DFT electronic structure for both compounds. Figure 10 displays the calculated dispersion relations along the high-symmetry directions of the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) and the total and projected DOS for both compounds for one spin direction. The YNiSi3 valence bands are composed of Ni d states for the most part, a small contribution of Si p states, and an even smaller contribution of Y d states [Fig. 10(a)]. The valence bands of LuNiSi3 are similar to those of YNiSi3, although the presence of Lu f states introduce almost dispersionless bands around 4.1 and 5.6 eV below the Fermi level [Fig. 10(b)]. The splitting of the f bands (1.5 eV) is due to the spin-orbit coupling that, in the case of LuNiSi3, is much stronger than the crystal-field splitting which lifts all the degeneracies of the Lu f states (point-group m2m) by less than 5 meV. The LuNiSi3 upper valence bands are composed mainly of Ni d states and some contribution of Si p and Lu d states. The conduction bands are also the result of the hybridization of d states coming from the metallic atoms with the Si p states, and for energies larger than 1 eV the contribution of Si s states becomes relevant as well. At the Fermi level, the contributions of the projected DOS for YNiSi3 are (in states/f.u., spin, and eV) 0.2131, 0.2544, and 0.1719 for Y d, Ni d, and Si p states, respectively. In the case of LuNiSi3, the contributions at the Fermi level of the Lu d, Ni d, and Si p states are 0.223, 0.2676, and 0.1858. Thus, we would expect an important contribution of 3d,\ \,3p, and 4d orbitals in the superconductivity of YNiSi3 (3d,\ \,3p, and 5d orbitals for LuNiSi3).

We have also estimated, under the crude assumption of the Sommerfeld model, the bare specific-heat coefficient \gamma_{\text{bare}} = \frac{3}{7}\pi^{2}\eta_{\text{F}}k_{\text{B}}^{2}, where \eta_{\text{F}} is the total DOS at the Fermi level (in states/f.u., spin, and eV). We have obtained for YNiSi3 and LuNiSi3, respectively, \eta_{\text{F}} = 0.6875 and 0.7433 (the relative errors are 19.6% and 12%), given \gamma_{\text{bare}} = 3.24 and 3.50 mJ mol^{- 1} K^{- 2}. Furthermore, we have estimated the specific-heat enhancement \frac{\gamma_{\text{bare}}}{\gamma_{\text{bare}}} = (1 + \lambda_{\text{c-ph}}), obtaining \lambda_{\text{c-ph}} = 0.247 and 0.134 for YNiSi3 and LuNiSi3, respectively. Such values for the electron-phonon coupling confirm that these compounds are in the weak-coupling regime.

The topology of the three conduction bands crossing the Fermi level is almost identical for both compounds as shown in Fig. 10 [FBZ high-symmetry points and directions are shown in Fig. 11(a)]. The first partially occupied band (magenta line) crosses the Fermi level in the vicinity of the high-symmetry point T, and it has a holelike character, its atomic character [see the inset in Fig. 10(a)] is built up by Ni d and Si p states. The second conduction band (violet line) crosses the Fermi level in all the high-symmetry directions except the \Delta direction (k_{\text{y}}). This band has an appreciable dispersion in all the directions that it crosses where its holelike character is manifested in the \Delta,\ H,\ T\cdot \Gamma, \Gamma\cdot S, and D directions. This band is made up by the hybridization of Y (Lu) d, Ni d, and Si p states except in the D direction where only the Ni and

Figure 9: (a) RNSi3 crystal structure, dark golden, black, and blue spheres denote the R, Ni, and Si atoms, respectively. The main building blocks are a set of corner-sharing square pyramids formed by Si that enclose the Ni atoms and another set of edge-sharing rectangular pyramids where the base and the apex are made up of Si and R atoms, respectively. Other remarkable features observed in this crystal structure are the pseudohexagons built up by Ni and Si atoms on (001) and the isosceles triangles made up by R atoms on (002). (b) Calculated electron localization function (ELF) for YNiSi3; upper, middle, and bottom panels show the (001), (002), and (101) planes, respectively.

  Figure 10: Calculated electronic structure: dispersion relation, total, and projected DOS for (a) YNiSi_{3}, and (b) LuNiSi_{3}. Highlighted in color are the three conduction bands crossing the Fermi level; band 1 (magenta), band 2 (violet), and band 3 (green). The eigenvalues are shifted to the Fermi level, which is indicated by a dashed line. The inset in panel (a) shows the atomic character of the dispersion relation where thick blue, red, and green lines correspond to Y d, Ni d, and Si p states, respectively. The inset in panel (b) zooms in on the projected DOS contributions at the Fermi level.

  Si orbitals are present. On the other hand, the third partially occupied band (green line) crosses only the D direction, having large dispersion and electron character. The orbital character of this band is only due to Ni d and Si p states. As was previously suggested [52] and later measured [34] for YbNiSi_{3}, the three bands collectively indicate that these compounds are good conductors along the [100] and [001] crystallographic directions but not along [010]. Our electronic structure results for both compounds also demonstrate their similarity to the isostructural compound YNiGe_{3}[29].

Figure 11 provides a visual representation of the calculated FS of these compounds. The first hole branch is formed by four pipes (blue/yellow surfaces) centered around \Gamma and parallel to the \Delta direction. The second branch has two main features, a holelike rectangular cylinder (green/violet colors) also centered around \Gamma and with its axis oriented along the \Delta direction and a set of large holelike cylinders running along the FBZ boundary, parallel to the \Delta direction and intricately connected around the FBZ boundaries. The third branch is built by four large electronlike disconnected cylinders (cyan/red colors) centered around the edge of the FBZ and running parallel to the \Delta direction. The first hole and the electron branches result from the hybridization of Ni d with Si p states, whereas the second hole branch also has the contribution of Y (Lu) d orbitals. Thus, the two large cylindrical branches are most likely responsible for the observed superconductivity in these systems.

Finally, we have also calculated the phononic properties of these compounds, such as the phonon dispersion relation, the partial density of states F(\omega), and the spectrum function \omega^{-2}F(\omega). We did not include the SOC in the calculation of the vibrational properties because the crystal structure and the FS are not affected by this interaction. The primitive cell of these systems contains ten atoms; therefore the phonon spectrum contains 3 acoustic and 27 optical branches as shown in Fig. 12. Although the dispersion relation and partial F(\omega) show an almost continuous distribution of modes across the whole frequency range, we can divide the phonon spectrum into three frequency regions: acoustic (0-4.0 and 0-3.2 THz for YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3}, respectively), intermediate (4.0-12.2 and 2.6-12.8 THz), and high (12.2-14.5 and 12.8-14.6 THz). The acoustic branches are made up from states of all the atoms almost evenly for YNiSi_{3}, whereas there is an appreciable increment of the Lu contribution in the case of LuNiSi_{3} due to its heavy mass. The intermediate-frequency range has 23 branches where 12 of these (up to approximately 6.7 THz) form the low-lying optical branches. These 12 branches are built up by states coming from all the atoms with Y (Lu) and Si contributions being larger than the Ni one. The remaining 11 intermediate branches are mainly made up of Si contributions and a small contribution of Ni states. The four branches forming the high-frequency region are almost solely formed by Si contributions.

From F(\omega), we can also obtain the spectrum function \omega^{-2}F(\omega), that can be used as a crude alternative to the Eliashberg function \alpha^{2}F(\omega); these two spectral functions exhibit a similar peak structure [53]. We can observe that \omega^{-2}F(\omega) has its larger spectral weight in the acoustical and low-lying optical branches for both compounds with its more prominent peaks located around the latter as is shown in Fig. 12. These 12 branches have contributions from the vibrations of all atoms [Y(Lu), Ni, Si], indicating that the coupling between the d electrons from Y(Lu) and Ni to Si p electrons will form Cooper pairs, therefore, they are responsible for the observed superconductivity of these compounds.

## V Discussion

To summarize, both YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} present bulk superconductivity, showing the features of type-I superconductors with \kappa=0.113(11) for YNiSi_{3} and \kappa=0.42(4) for LuNiSi_{3}. The main superconducting parameters for both compounds are given in Table 3.

The discovery of type-I superconductivity in ternary compounds is not unprecedented with recent publications reporting the appearance of type-I superconductivity in the cage compound LaTi_{2}Al_{20}[11] and in the NCS LaPdSi_{3}[12] and LaIrSi_{3}[13] compounds. The case of the NCS LaRhSi_{3} is even more intriguing since it has been recently reported as a type-II/1 superconductor with \kappa=0.25[24, 26]. This compound has a phase diagram with resistivity and susceptibility measurements giving an exceptionally high upper critical field (\approx120 mT) compared to H_{\rm c}(0) obtained from standard specific-heat and magnetization measurements (\approx20 mT), interpreted as arising from surface superconductivity.

Figure 11: (a) FBZ of the space-group Cmmm. The main symmetry points and lines are labeled in black and red, respectively. (b) Extended Fermi surface of YNiSi_{3}. The FBZ is shown by black lines, and it is oriented along the \Delta direction (k_{y}). (c) Extended Fermi surface of LuNiSi_{3}.

  DFT results show that both YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} have a nonmagnetic ground state and that, although SOC does not affect the FS of these compounds, SOC does act significantly on the Lu f states below the Fermi level resulting in a large splitting of these orbitals that overcomes the insignificant crystal-field splitting. ELF shows that for both compounds there are three types of atomic bonding: metallic, covalent, and ionic. The metallic bond is observed between Lu(Y) and Si on the (002) plane and the Ni and Si atoms on the (001) plane. The electronic structure indicates that these compounds are good conductors along the [100] and [001] directions but not along [010]. From the FS, we find that the second hole branch is built up by hybridization of Y(Lu) d, Ni d, and Si p states, whereas Ni d and Si p states hybridize to form the electron branch. These branches connect the FBZ boundaries and are responsible for the observed superconductivity. The partial F(\omega) and spectrum function \omega^{-2}F(\omega) indicate that the coupling of Y(Lu), Ni d, and Si p electrons in the low-lying optical phonon branches will form the Cooper pairs responsible of the superconducting state. These findings show that these compounds are anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) metals with a multiband superconducting state.

The larger spectral weight \omega^{-2}F(\omega) present in LuNiSi_{3} for the low-lying optical branches together with the large \eta_{\rm F} might explain the higher critical temperature seen in LuNiSi_{3}.

## VI VI. Conclusion

We have reported the discovery of superconductivity in YNiSi_{3} [T_{\rm c} = 1.36(3) K] and LuNiSi_{3} [T_{\rm c} = 1.61(2) K] by characterizing the superconducting behaviors of single crystals through magnetization, heat-capacity, and resistivity experiments with support from DFT band-structure calculations. Both compounds show bulk superconductivity with features that are typical of type-I SC but with a low jump in the specific heat [\Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c} is equal to 1.14(9) and 0.71(5) for the Y and Lu compounds, respectively]. Resistivity measurements show a highly anisotropic behavior between the measurements under an applied field with the configuration H\perp b displaying the highest critical fields. DFT calculations show that these compounds are anisotropic 3D metals with a multiband superconducting ground state.

###### Abstract

We report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in the ternary intermetallics YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3}. High-quality single crystals were grown via the Sn-flux method and studied using magnetization, specific-heat, and resistivity measurements at low temperatures. The critical temperatures obtained from these different techniques are in very good agreement and yield T_{\rm c}=1.36(3) K and T_{\rm c}=1.61(2) K for YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3}, respectively. Magnetization measurements indicate that both compounds are among the rare cases where type-I superconductivity occurs in a ternary intermetallic, however, the jump in the specific heat at the transition is lower than the value expected from BCS theory (\Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{\rm g}T_{\rm c}=1.43) in both materials and is equal to 1.14(9) and 0.71(5) for the Y and Lu compounds, respectively. Resistive measurements exhibit sharp transitions but with critical fields \mu_{0}H_{\rm c}(0) (\approx0.05 T for YNiSi_{3}) and \approx0.08 T for LuNiSi_{3}) considerably higher than those obtained from the magnetization and specific heat (\approx0.01 T). First-principles density functional theory calculated electronic structure shows that these compounds have highly anisotropic and complex Fermi surfaces with one electronic and two holelike branches. One hole branch and the electron branch have a large cylindrical topology connecting the first Brillouin-zone boundaries, the former being built up by the hybridization of Y(Lu) d, Ni d, and Si p states, and the latter being built up by Ni d and Si p states. The calculated phononic structures indicate that the coupling of the Y(Lu), Ni d, and Si p electrons in the low-lying optical phonon branches is responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs and the observed superconducting state. Therefore, these compounds can be classified as anisotropic three-dimensional metals with multiband superconducting ground states in the weak-coupling regime.

## I Introduction

The search for new superconductors (SCs) has, in the past decade, often focused on heavy-fermion materials and/or materials whose unit cells lack a center of inversion--the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) superconductors [1]. This is because these materials are thought to be good candidates for unconventional superconductors, which do not conform to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory [2, 3, 4, 5] and can exhibit high critical fields--on the order of a few teslas--as well as high critical temperatures. Despite the large number of reported studies, the relationship between a material's crystal structure and its superconducting properties is not yet firmly established. Therefore, it is essential to explore unusual features of centrosymmetric superconductors in order to unravel the role of crystalline structure _per se_. In the same way, the study of compounds with weak electron correlations, such as Sc-, Y-, La-, and Lu-based SCs, can enhance our comprehension of heavy-fermion SCs.

Superconductors are traditionally categorized into type I or II, according to the transition of the superconducting phase to the normal state under an applied magnetic field: type-I SCs have a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa<1/\sqrt{2} and undergo a first-order transition into the superconducting state in a magnetic field, whereas type-II SCs present a second-order phase transition and \kappa>1/\sqrt{2}. The ratio \kappa=\lambda/\xi connects the two length parameters yielded by the GL equations: the GL penetration depth \lambda and the superconducting coherence length \xi. Within this classification, type-I superconductivity is normally displayed by elemental SCs, e.g., Pb, Hg, and Sn, although several exceptions have been found, such as the binary compounds CaBi_{2}[6], KBi_{2}[7], ScGa_{3}, LuGa_{3}[8], YbSb_{2}[9], and PdTe_{2}[10], the ternary cage compound LaTi_{2}Al_{20}[11], and the NCS LaPdSi_{3}[12], and LaIrSi_{3}[13].

Whereas the vast majority of superconducting binary and ternary intermetallic compounds are of type II, increasing numbers of materials have been found with intermediate behaviors. Therefore, type-II SCs were further classified into types-II/1 (\kappa\approx 1/\sqrt{2}), -II/2 (traditional type-II \kappa>1/\sqrt{2}) [14], and -1.5 (\kappa\gg 1/\sqrt{2}) [15, 16, 17]. Some examples of type II/1 are Nb [18], ZrB_{12}[19, 20], and the noncentrosymmetric superconductors AuBe [21], RhGe [22], and LaRhSi_{3}[23, 24, 25, 26]. Type-1.5 SCs may include MgB_{2}[15, 16, 17] and Sr_{2}RuO_{4}[27].

In the NiGe_{3} (R= Y, Ce) (where R represents rare earth) series [28, 29] with a centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure, the compounds YNiGe_{3}[30] and CeNiGe_{3}[31, 32, 33] are superconductors. The former has an unusually low specific heat jump at the transition compared to the prediction of BCS theory [30], whereas the latter is an unconventional heavy-fermion superconductor under pressure.

 In this paper, we present a detailed characterization of two nonmagnetic compounds of the _R_NiSi_{3} series (those with R = Y, Lu) expected to show many of the same features as YNiGe_{3} with _T_c = 0.46 K [30]. We report on the discovery, via resistivity, magnetization, and specific-heat measurements, of bulk type-I superconductivity in single crystals of YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} with critical temperatures _T_c = 1.36(3) K for YNiSi_{3} and _T_c = 1.61(2) K for LuNiSi_{3}. We also present density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the electronic properties of these compounds.

## II Methods

YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} single crystals were synthesized via the Sn-flux method originally used to grow YbNiSi_{3}[34]. A proportion of 1:1:3:45 (Y/Lu:Ni:Si:Sn) was used as detailed in previous work [35] wherein the crystalline structures were verified by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis and wavelength dispersive electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) of the single crystals, conducted in a JEOL JXA-8200 microanalyzer. The crystal compositions were determined by averaging over ten different points of a polished sample.

Resistivity between 0.04 and 4 K was measured with a standard four-probe ac method in a homemade system inside a commercial Cambridge Magnetic Refrigeration mFridge mF-ADR50 with applied magnetic fields in two orientations: parallel or perpendicular to the crystal plate main surfaces. Specific heat between 0.37 and 5 K was measured on crystals with total mass of about 7 mg, under applied fields parallel to the plates, using the 2t thermal relaxation method in the Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System.

Magnetic susceptibility was measured in a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System magnetometer with an iQuantum ^{3}He insert--in this case, the field was perpendicular to the plate surfaces. Proper evaluation of the magnetization measurements in SCs must take into account the demagnetization factor (_N_) due to the sample shape since the volumetric susceptibility of a bulk SC must approach \chi\sim-1 below the critical temperature. In our case, the platelike shape of the crystal made it simple to estimate _N_~0.5 for YNiSi_{3} and _N_~0.7 for LuNiSi_{3} with the magnetic field applied perpendicular to the main surface of the sample (_H_ || _b_).

Spin-polarized first-principles DFT calculations, including spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a second-variational scheme, have been carried out using the full-potential augmented-plane wave method with local orbitals (FP-APW + lo) as implemented in the elk code [36]. For the exchange-correlation energy functional, we have used the generalized gradient approximation and its PBEsol parametrization [37]. The muffin-tin (MT) radii of Y, Lu, Ni, and Si are set to R_{\rm MT}^{\rm N}=2.7777,~R_{\rm MT}^{\rm La}=2.7495,~R_{\rm MT}^{\rm N}= 2.0563,~R_{\rm MT}^{\rm Si}=2.0563 a.u., respectively. The parameter R_{\rm MT}|\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{k}|_{\rm max} governing the number of plane waves in the FP-APW + lo method is chosen to be 9.5. The Brillouin zone (BZ) is sampled with a uniformly spaced **k** grid of 8 x 8 x 8 for the structural relaxation and 16 x 16 x 16 for the calculation of the dispersion relation _E_(**k**), the total and site projected densities of states (DOS) and the Fermi surface (FS).

## III Experimental Results

Previous work on the series _R_NiSi_{3}[35] showed, by PXRD analysis, that these compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic space group _Cmmm_. The experimental lattice constants are given in Table I of the Supplemental Material [38]. Elemental analysis using EPMA revealed average sample compositions of Y_{0.96(1)}Ni_{1.00(19)}Si_{3.00(18)} and Lu_{1.00(1)}Ni_{0.68(2)}Si_{3.13(2)} with an upper limit of ~500 ppm Sn impurities in both crystals. LuNiSi_{3} crystals thus perform with significant Ni vacancies, as observed in the _R_NiGe_{3} series [28]. This effect is small for YNiGe_{3} but is more pronounced for heavier rare earths as in the case of LuNiGe_{3}. There were some small NiSi_{2} crystallites attached to the surface of the crystals (a diamagnetic non-superconducting metallic silicide [39, 40, 41]) that could be easily removed by polishing. Besides Sn (_T_c = 3.7 K), no other superconducting impurity was detected, so we may claim that the superconducting transitions presented below are due to these new intermetallic compounds.

In the following sections, we describe the characteristics of the superconductivity in YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} through magnetization, specific-heat, and resistivity experiments.

### YNiSi_{3}

Figure 1 shows the magnetic characterization of YNiSi_{3}._kh_(_T_) [Fig. 1(a)] was measured under an applied field of m0_H_ = 2 mT following a zero-field-cooled warming protocol. At 1.31(2) K, there is a relatively sharp transition with _kh_ rising from the value of -1 s expected by the complete field expulsion of a bulk SC. Figure 1(b) shows the _M_(_H_) curves at several temperatures below the superconducting transition. They are marked by a type-I SC behavior with M = -_H_ at low fields and an abrupt jump at _H_c. The transition in some type-I SC can be broadened by the presence of impurities, inhomogeneities, and even a high demagnetization effect, however the type-I behavior of this sample is very clear, attesting to the quality of the crystal.

The critical fields extracted from the curves in Fig. 1(b) were used to plot the phase diagram displayed in Fig. 1(c). The points were fitted by the empirical parabolic law [42],

\[H_{\rm c}(T)=H_{\rm c}(0)\Bigg{[}1-\left(\frac{T}{T_{\rm c}}\right)^{2}\Bigg{]},\] (1)

yielding an estimated critical field m0_H_c(0) = 9.6(2) mT.

Figure 2(a) shows the dependence of the total heat-capacity (_C_p) on T for YNiSi_{3} at zero field and with H ranging from 5 mT up to 1 T, a field well above that in which the superconductivity is suppressed. At zero field, there is a jump at 1.35(5) K, agreeing with the bulk superconductivity observed in the magnetization measurements. The data also seem to show a double peak, which could be a sign of a double transition over a narrow temperature range, but the resolution is not sufficient to allow a definitive conclusion. For the curves measured under applied fields, the transition temperature shifts to lower T with values comparable to the critical temperatures observed in Fig. 1(b). The jumps in _C_p(_T_) in 5 and 6 mT are higher than in zero field, suggesting a first-order transition for H  0. Figure 2(b) shows the dependence of _C_p/_T_ with T for the same data displayed in

 Fig. 2(a), whereas the inset shows C_{\rm p}/T vs T^{2} measured with \mu_{0}H=300 mT. The normal-state C_{\rm p} was fit with the expression C_{\rm p}(T)/T=\gamma_{\rm N}+\beta T^{2}+BT^{4} where the first term is due to the electronic contribution and the \beta T^{2}+BT^{4} terms describe the phonon contribution following the Debye model. The fit yields \gamma_{\rm N}=4.04(9) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2},\ \beta=0.0961(5) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4}, and B=0.0090(5) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-6}. The Debye temperature can be evaluated using

\[\theta_{\rm D}=\left(\frac{n12\pi^{4}R}{5\beta}\right)^{1/3},\] (2)

Figure 2: (a) Temperature dependence of C_{\rm p} at several magnetic fields for YNiSi_{3}. (b) C_{\rm p}/T vs T for the same curves displayed in Fig. 2(a). The inset shows C_{\rm p}/T vs T^{2} for a larger range of temperature. (c) Electronic contribution of specific heat for H=0 with the fits obtained with the models given in Eqs. (5) and (6).

(b) M(H) curves at several temperatures below the superconductor transition. (c) H_{\rm c} vs T phase diagram with each H_{\rm c}(T) value extracted from the curves in (b) and the fit made using Eq. (1).

  where n = 5 is the number of atoms per formula unit and R is the molar gas constant, yielding \theta_{\text{D}} = 466(9) K. The values of \gamma_{\text{N}} and \theta_{\text{D}} are comparable to those obtained in the previous work at high temperatures \gamma_{\text{N}} = 4.1\text{ mJ mol}^{-1}\text{ K}^{-2} and \theta_{\text{D}} = 393 K [35]. The density of states at the Fermi-level [_N_(_EF_)] is obtained using the relation,

\[N(E_{\text{F}}) = \frac{3\gamma_{\text{N}}}{\pi^{2}k_{\text{B}}^{2}N_{\text{A}}},\]

where _k_B is the Boltzmann constant and _N_A is the Avogadro number, resulting in _N_(_EF_) = 1.71 states/eV f.u. The electron-phonon coupling constant _l_e-ph is calculated using McMillan's formula [43],

\[\lambda_{\text{e-ph}} = \frac{1.04 + \mu^{*}\ln(\theta_{\text{D}}/1.45T_{\text{c}})}{(1-0.62\mu^{*})\ln(\theta_{\text{D}}/1.45T_{\text{c}})-1.04},\]

where _m_* is usually taken between 0.1 and 0.15. Using a _m_* of 0.125 yields _l_e-ph = 0.43(2) placing YNiSi3 in the weak-coupling regime together with the NCS LaPdSi3 [12], (_l_e-ph = 0.51) LaRhSi3 [24] (_l_e-ph = 0.5), and Th7Fe3 (_l_e-ph = 0.59) [44]. It should be noted that McMillan's formula works better for pure metals because the Debye temperature is not properly defined in compounds containing elements with such large differences in their atomic masses.

Figure 2(c) shows the electronic heat-capacity (_C_el), obtained by subtracting the \beta T^{3} + BT^{5} terms from the zero-field data. For a BCS superconductor, the jump of \Delta C_{\text{el}} is expected to have an _s_-wave gap with \Delta C_{\text{el}}/\gamma_{\text{N}}T_{\text{c}} = 1.43; however, the estimated value for this compound is 1.14(9), significantly lower than expected. This has also been observed for the ternary type-I SC LaIrSi3 [13] and for the similar compound YNiGe3 [30]; in both cases, it was hypothesized that such a low value of the specific-heat jump is related to a large anisotropy in the superconducting gap.

We have tested four different models to fit the _C_el data in the superconducting regime: a single-gap a model for a BCS SC (_C_el^SG), a double-gap a model (_C_el^DG), a single-gap a model with a contribution from a nonsuperconducting fraction (_C_S  current, so a discussion on the presence of any anisotropic magnetoresistance effects is left for future work.

At zero field, there is a sharp transition at 1.42(2) K with \rho(T) quickly reaching zero even with a highest available data point density. The residual resistivity before the superconducting transition is \rho_{0}=0.33(3)\mu\Omega cm, obtained by averaging the values estimated in both directions, and the residual resistivity ratio (RRR), already published [35], is 54(5). With increasing magnetic field, there is very little broadening of the transition, however, for H higher than 20 mT, the transition is no longer complete. Comparison of Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) indicates that there is an important anisotropy with the configuration displayed in Fig. 3(b) showing higher T_{\text{c}} for the same H and a complete superconducting transition even under the presence of an applied field of 40 mT. Measuring down to 40 mK allows the observation of a partial transition under fields as high as 0.15 T in the configuration shown in Fig. 3(b). The critical fields obtained with these measurements are considerably higher than those observed in the magnetization and specific-heat measurements. We will return to this point in the Discussion section.

The thermodynamic quantities related to the first-order superconducting transition can be evaluated using the zero-field electronic specific-heat data displayed in Fig. 2(c). The equations below give the relationship between the internal energy (\Delta U), latent heat (T\Delta S), free energy (\Delta F), and critical field [H_{\text{c}}(T)] and how we can evaluate them from the specific-heat data,

\[\begin{split}\Delta F(T)&=-\frac{\mu_{0}VH_{\text{c }}^{2}(T)}{2}=\Delta U-T\ \Delta S,\\ \Delta U(T)&=\int_{T}^{T_{\text{c}}}[C_{\text{s}}(T^ {\prime})-C_{\text{n}}(T^{\prime})]dT^{\prime},\\ \Delta S(T)&=\int_{T}^{T}\frac{C_{\text{s}}(T^{\prime })-C_{\text{n}}(T^{\prime})}{T^{\prime}}dT^{\prime},\end{split}\] (7)

where V is the volume of a formula unit. Figure 4(a) shows the dependence of \Delta U, T\Delta S, and \Delta F with temperature for YNiSi_{3}. The dependence of H_{\text{c}}(T) obtained with this method is displayed in Fig. 4(b) and yields a critical field \mu_{0}H_{\text{c}}(0) of 7.0(7) mT, lower than the one obtained from magnetization [Fig. 1(c)]. Along with this curve, we display, in Fig. 4(b), the behavior of H_{\text{c}}(T) for YNiSi_{3} obtained with the experimental

Figure 4: (a) Temperature dependence of the internal energy difference (\Delta U), latent heat (T\Delta S), and free-energy (\Delta F) for YNiSi_{3}. These curves were calculated using the specific-heat measurements at zero field and Eq. (7). (b) Temperature dependence of the critical field H_{\text{c}}(T) obtained from different techniques: using the free energy shown in (a) and the specific-heat, magnetization, and resistivity measurements as a function of the applied field.

  results presented above, including the data shown in Fig. 1(c). The values of H_{\text{c}} and T_{\text{c}} resulting from the \rho(T) curves were obtained taking the temperature corresponding to a decrease in 50% of \rho_{0}, and we disregarded the curves that did not reach zero resistivity, although the transitions can be observed with fields as high as 150 mT. Despite all the results pointing to type-I superconductivity, it is notable that the critical fields obtained from resistivity with configuration H\perp b are about eight times higher at low temperatures compared to the other techniques. This could be an effect of surface superconductivity that only \rho(T) can probe, but as it is highly anisotropic, it seems a robust effect.

The techniques discussed above allow us to obtain the basic superconducting parameters for YNiSi_{3}. The electron-density n can be calculated considering the contribution of the three electrons from Y^{3+} and the presence of four formula units per unit cell of the compound (Z=4), yielding n=12/V_{\text{cell}}=3.70\times 10^{28} m^{-3}, where V_{\text{cell}}=324.49 A^{3} for YNiSi_{3}[35]. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, k_{\text{F}} is given by k_{\text{F}}\equiv(27\pi)^{1/3} which leads to an effective mass m^{+}=\hbar^{2}k_{\text{F}}^{2}\gamma_{\text{N}}/\pi^{2}nk_{\text{B}}^{2}=1.54 m_{0}, where m_{0} is the free-electron mass and \gamma_{\text{N}} is in volume units [the density of YNiSi_{3} is 4.7459(2) g/cm^{3}]. The mean free path is given by l=\hbar k_{\text{F}}/ne^{2}\rho_{0}=347 nm. The London penetration depth \lambda_{\text{L}} can be estimated from the relation \lambda_{\text{L}}=(m^{*}/\mu_{0}ne^{2})^{1/2} and is equal to 34(3) nm. Finally, the BCS coherence length in the clean limit is \xi_{0}=0.18\hbar^{2}k_{\text{F}}/k_{\text{B}}T_{\text{c}}m^{*}=780(80) nm. Using the relations \lambda_{\text{GL}}=\lambda_{\text{L}}(1+0.75\xi_{0}/1)^{1/2}/\sqrt{2} and \xi_{\text{GL}}=0.74\xi_{0}(1+0.75\xi_{0}/1)^{-1/2} for T=0[49], we obtain \kappa=\lambda_{\text{GL}}/\xi_{\text{GL}}=0.113(11). This value puts YNiSi_{3} in the type-I limit since \kappa<1/\sqrt{2}, in line with the results from the previous measurements.

### LuNiSi_{3}

The superconducting properties of LuNiSi_{3} are very similar to YNiSi_{3}, but the superconductivity occurs at a higher critical temperature [T_{\text{c}}=1.61(2) K]. As the ionic radius of Lu^{3+} is smaller than Y^{3+}, LuNiSi_{3} has a smaller unit-cell volume than YNiSi_{3}, confirmed by previous x-ray analysis [35]. This increase in T_{\text{c}} may be a consequence of a chemical pressure effect from the reduced volume, making these compounds good candidates for subsequent low-temperature pressure studies.

Figure 5 shows the magnetic measurements for LuNiSi_{3} after taking into account the demagnetization factor correction.\chi(T) displayed in Fig. 5(a) was collected using a ZFC-FCW protocol with an applied field of \mu_{0}H=1 mT perpendicular to the plate (H\parallel b). The transition occurs at 1.58(2) K with \chi(T) approaching -1 at low temperatures. The M(H) curves displayed in Fig. 5(b), at several temperatures below T_{\text{c}}, present the same features of a type-I SC observed for YNiSi_{3}. A fit of the experimental critical field points in the phase diagram [Fig. 5(c)] using Eq. (1) yields \mu_{0}H_{\text{c}}(0)=10.4(2) mT.

The dependence of the specific heat on T at several applied fields for LuNiSi_{3} is presented in Fig. 6. Figure 6(a) shows a sharp transition at 1.63(2) K in zero field due to the superconducting transition. The transition shifts to lower temperatures with an increasing applied field as expected. The main panel in Fig. 6(b) shows the curve C_{\text{p}}/T vs T, whereas the inset shows C_{\text{p}}/T vs T^{2} measured

(b) M(H) curves at several temperatures below the superconductor transition. (c) Phase diagram with H_{\text{c}} extracted from the curves in panel (b) and the fit of Eq. (1).

  with \mu_{0}H=9 mT and the fit above the superconducting transition. The value of \gamma_{\text{N}}=3.97(9) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} was found (slightly below that for YNiSi_{3}) yielding a jump of \Delta C_{\text{el}}/\gamma_{\text{N}}T_{\text{c}}=0.71(5) also below the value expected from BCS theory. The experimentally estimated Debye temperature was 474(8) K [\beta=0.0910(5) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4} and B=0.000\,44(9) mJ mol^{-1} K^{-6}], similar to the previous work at high temperatures (484 K) [35]. The value of the electron-phonon coupling constant following Eq. (4) is \lambda_{\text{e-ph}}=0.44(2) also placing LuNiSi_{3} in the weak-coupling regime. The density of states at the Fermi level is, following Eq. (3), N(E_{\text{F}})=1.69 states/eV f.u.

Figure 6(c) shows C_{\text{el}} vs T in the superconducting regime and fits using the models described in Eqs. (5) and (6). The fit parameters are given in Table II. The results are very similar to YNiSi_{3}, and it is not possible to determine which compound has a larger superconducting gap.

Resistivity measurements for LuNiSi_{3} (Fig. 7) were conducted in the same configurations used for YNiSi_{3}. A sharp transition at 1.63(2) K takes place in zero field, and significant anisotropy is observed comparing Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) with the higher critical fields occurring for the geometry with H\perp b in the same way as YNiSi_{3}. In Fig. 7(b), a complete transition occurs up to 80 mT. The residual resistivity before

  the superconducting transition for this compound is \rho_{0} = 1.8(3) \mu\Omega cm and RRR = 38(4) [35].

We performed the same thermodynamic analysis using Eq. (7) for LuNiSi_{3}, and results are displayed in Fig. 8(a). Overall, the energies and latent heat curves for both compounds are very similar but reach higher absolute values for LuNiSi_{3}. Figure 8(b) shows the H_{\text{c}}(T) curve obtained using Eq. (7) and the data from Fig. 8(a) with a critical field of about 8.3 mT and the H_{\text{c}}(T) curves obtained with the experimental results presented above. As for YNiSi_{3}, the H_{\text{c}}(T) curves for LuNiSi_{3} obtained from magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity with H\parallel b are very similar, whereas the curve with H\perp b in the resistivity gives much higher critical fields.

Following the same analysis used for YNiSi_{3}, the electron density of LuNiSi_{3} yields n=3.83\times 10^{28} m^{-3} with V_{\text{cell}}=313.62 A^{3}[35]. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, the effective mass is m^{*}=1.51m_{0} [the density of LuNiSi_{3} is 6.5696(3) g/cm^{3}], the estimated mean free path is equal to l=63 nm, lower than for YNiSi_{3}, and the London penetration depth is 33(3) nm. Finally, the BCS coherence length in the clean limit is \xi_{0}=690(70) nm, and using the equations above for \lambda_{\text{GL}} and \xi_{\text{GL}}, we obtain \kappa=0.42(4). This value also puts LuNiSi_{3} in the type-I limit but much closer to the borderline value of 0.707.

## IV IV. Theoretical results

Since Ni is commonly a magnetic ion, we first checked for the possibility of magnetic order by starting from different spin configurations [including Y(Lu) and Ni atoms with parallel spins, Y(Lu) and Ni atoms with antiparallel spins for each sublattice, etc.], but all starting configurations converged to a nonmagnetic ground state with zero local magnetic moments, i.e., diamagnetic compounds are obtained. These results are compatible with the magnetic measurements reported previously [35] and with the results presented in the Experimental Results section of this paper.

Having established the magnetic configuration of these compounds, we have studied their crystallographic properties. The crystal structure of RNiSi_{3} has a base-centered orthorhombic centrosymmetric space-group Cmmm where the R = (Y, Lu) and the Ni atoms are located at the Wyckoff positions 4j (m2m) and 4i (m2m), respectively. There are three inequivalent Si atoms, two of them situated at positions 4i and one at 4j. The crystal structure is shown in Fig. 9(a), and the calculated and experimental lattice constants are shown in Table 1 of the Supplemental Material [38]. The optimization of the Wyckoff positions and lattice vectors shows the same crystal symmetry for all calculated volumes. Comparing our results for the equilibrium volumes with the available experimental data, the absolute error for the lattice constants is less than 1% for both compounds, whereas absolute errors in the volume are 1.71% and 1.56% for YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3}, respectively. Another important finding is deduced from the calculated vibrational dispersion relation at the equilibrium volumes where there are no imaginary frequencies, and therefore, the dynamical stability of the crystal structure of these compounds is maintained.

In order to understand the bonding properties of these crystalline materials, we have also calculated the ELF which gives a sound basis for a well-defined classification of bonds [50,51]. According to the ELF construction, this function can take values between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to perfect localization and 0.5 corresponds to the case of a homogeneous electron gas. Then, pure ionic bonding should manifest as high values of the ELF close to the nuclei and very low values (\sim0) uniformly distributed in the interstitial region. Pure covalent bonding between two atoms should display a local maximum of the ELF on the line connecting those atoms with a typical maximum value of the ELF in the range between 0.6 and 1.0, depending on how strong the bond is. Metallic bonding, which represents an intermediate case between the covalent bonding and ionic bonding, usually shows an almost uniform ELF distribution in the interstitial region with typical values on the order of 0.3-0.6. Figure 9(b) presents our calculated ELF for YNiSi_{3}. We have chosen three sections to display the ELF, namely, the NiSi_{2} and YSi layers, i.e., the (001) and (002) planes, and a section through all three atoms: the (101) plane.

Figure 8: (a) Temperature dependence of the internal energy difference (Δ_U_), latent heat (_T_Δ_S_), and free energy (Δ_F_) for LuNiSi_{3}. These curves were calculated using the specific-heat measurements at zero field and Eq. (7). (b) Temperature dependence of the critical field H_{\text{c}}(T) obtained from different techniques: using the free energy shown in (a) and using the specific-heat, magnetization, and resistivity measurements as a function of the applied field.

  The ELF values on (001) indicate that the bond between the Si atoms forming dimers along [010] is covalent (maximum value of 0.95) and stronger than the also covalent bond (maximum value of 0.82) between the Si atoms that build up the zigzag chain along [100]. On the other hand, the ELF values found in the regions connecting Ni-Si atoms reveal the metallic character of these bonds (maximum value of 0.48). On the (002) plane, the ELF functions (maximum value of 0.95) corroborate the covalent nature of the bonds of the Si dimers along [010], whereas the bonding between the Y and the Si atoms is metallic (maximum value of 0.51). Observing the ELF between the Y atoms that build the isosceles triangle on (002), we can deduce the bonding is ionic (maximum value of 0.21). Finally, the calculated ELF on (101) shows the weakly metallic behavior of the Y-Ni bond (maximum value of 0.32). To summarize, all types of chemical bonds can be distinguished in the YNiSi3 system: ionic (between Y atoms), metallic (among Ni-Si, Y-Si, and Ni-Y), and covalent (within the Si dimers and zigzag chains). We do not show the calculated ELF for LuNiSi3 because it is very similar to YNiSi3 and, consequently, the bonding properties are the same.

We have also calculated the elastic constants (see Table II of the Supplemental Material [38]) and then the Debye temperature using the following equation:

\[\Theta_{\text{D}} = \frac{\hbar sq_{\text{D}}}{k_{\text{B}}},\]

where s = (\frac{1}{3s_{i}^{2}} + \frac{2}{3s_{i}^{2}})^{- 1/3} is the average sound velocity, s_{l} = \sqrt{\frac{B + \{G\}}{\rho}} is the longitudinal sound velocity, s_{t} = \sqrt{\frac{G}{\rho}} is the transverse sound velocity, G is the isotropic shear modulus which is calculated in terms of the crystalline lattice constants q_{\text{D}} = \sqrt[3]{6\pi^{2}\eta_{a}}, and \eta_{a} is the atomic concentration. The calculated values are 497 and 464 K for YNiSi3 and LuNiSi3 with absolute relative errors of 6.7 and 2.1%, in good agreement with the experimental values.

For a better understanding of the basic electronic properties that may lead to the experimentally observed behavior of YNiSi3 and LuNiSi3, we now present the calculated DFT electronic structure for both compounds. Figure 10 displays the calculated dispersion relations along the high-symmetry directions of the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) and the total and projected DOS for both compounds for one spin direction. The YNiSi3 valence bands are composed of Ni d states for the most part, a small contribution of Si p states, and an even smaller contribution of Y d states [Fig. 10(a)]. The valence bands of LuNiSi3 are similar to those of YNiSi3, although the presence of Lu f states introduce almost dispersionless bands around 4.1 and 5.6 eV below the Fermi level [Fig. 10(b)]. The splitting of the f bands (1.5 eV) is due to the spin-orbit coupling that, in the case of LuNiSi3, is much stronger than the crystal-field splitting which lifts all the degeneracies of the Lu f states (point-group m2m) by less than 5 meV. The LuNiSi3 upper valence bands are composed mainly of Ni d states and some contribution of Si p and Lu d states. The conduction bands are also the result of the hybridization of d states coming from the metallic atoms with the Si p states, and for energies larger than 1 eV the contribution of Si s states becomes relevant as well. At the Fermi level, the contributions of the projected DOS for YNiSi3 are (in states/f.u., spin, and eV) 0.2131, 0.2544, and 0.1719 for Y d, Ni d, and Si p states, respectively. In the case of LuNiSi3, the contributions at the Fermi level of the Lu d, Ni d, and Si p states are 0.223, 0.2676, and 0.1858. Thus, we would expect an important contribution of 3d,\ \,3p, and 4d orbitals in the superconductivity of YNiSi3 (3d,\ \,3p, and 5d orbitals for LuNiSi3).

We have also estimated, under the crude assumption of the Sommerfeld model, the bare specific-heat coefficient \gamma_{\text{bare}} = \frac{3}{7}\pi^{2}\eta_{\text{F}}k_{\text{B}}^{2}, where \eta_{\text{F}} is the total DOS at the Fermi level (in states/f.u., spin, and eV). We have obtained for YNiSi3 and LuNiSi3, respectively, \eta_{\text{F}} = 0.6875 and 0.7433 (the relative errors are 19.6% and 12%), given \gamma_{\text{bare}} = 3.24 and 3.50 mJ mol^{- 1} K^{- 2}. Furthermore, we have estimated the specific-heat enhancement \frac{\gamma_{\text{bare}}}{\gamma_{\text{bare}}} = (1 + \lambda_{\text{c-ph}}), obtaining \lambda_{\text{c-ph}} = 0.247 and 0.134 for YNiSi3 and LuNiSi3, respectively. Such values for the electron-phonon coupling confirm that these compounds are in the weak-coupling regime.

The topology of the three conduction bands crossing the Fermi level is almost identical for both compounds as shown in Fig. 10 [FBZ high-symmetry points and directions are shown in Fig. 11(a)]. The first partially occupied band (magenta line) crosses the Fermi level in the vicinity of the high-symmetry point T, and it has a holelike character, its atomic character [see the inset in Fig. 10(a)] is built up by Ni d and Si p states. The second conduction band (violet line) crosses the Fermi level in all the high-symmetry directions except the \Delta direction (k_{\text{y}}). This band has an appreciable dispersion in all the directions that it crosses where its holelike character is manifested in the \Delta,\ H,\ T\cdot \Gamma, \Gamma\cdot S, and D directions. This band is made up by the hybridization of Y (Lu) d, Ni d, and Si p states except in the D direction where only the Ni and

Figure 9: (a) RNSi3 crystal structure, dark golden, black, and blue spheres denote the R, Ni, and Si atoms, respectively. The main building blocks are a set of corner-sharing square pyramids formed by Si that enclose the Ni atoms and another set of edge-sharing rectangular pyramids where the base and the apex are made up of Si and R atoms, respectively. Other remarkable features observed in this crystal structure are the pseudohexagons built up by Ni and Si atoms on (001) and the isosceles triangles made up by R atoms on (002). (b) Calculated electron localization function (ELF) for YNiSi3; upper, middle, and bottom panels show the (001), (002), and (101) planes, respectively.

  Figure 10: Calculated electronic structure: dispersion relation, total, and projected DOS for (a) YNiSi_{3}, and (b) LuNiSi_{3}. Highlighted in color are the three conduction bands crossing the Fermi level; band 1 (magenta), band 2 (violet), and band 3 (green). The eigenvalues are shifted to the Fermi level, which is indicated by a dashed line. The inset in panel (a) shows the atomic character of the dispersion relation where thick blue, red, and green lines correspond to Y d, Ni d, and Si p states, respectively. The inset in panel (b) zooms in on the projected DOS contributions at the Fermi level.

  Si orbitals are present. On the other hand, the third partially occupied band (green line) crosses only the D direction, having large dispersion and electron character. The orbital character of this band is only due to Ni d and Si p states. As was previously suggested [52] and later measured [34] for YbNiSi_{3}, the three bands collectively indicate that these compounds are good conductors along the [100] and [001] crystallographic directions but not along [010]. Our electronic structure results for both compounds also demonstrate their similarity to the isostructural compound YNiGe_{3}[29].

Figure 11 provides a visual representation of the calculated FS of these compounds. The first hole branch is formed by four pipes (blue/yellow surfaces) centered around \Gamma and parallel to the \Delta direction. The second branch has two main features, a holelike rectangular cylinder (green/violet colors) also centered around \Gamma and with its axis oriented along the \Delta direction and a set of large holelike cylinders running along the FBZ boundary, parallel to the \Delta direction and intricately connected around the FBZ boundaries. The third branch is built by four large electronlike disconnected cylinders (cyan/red colors) centered around the edge of the FBZ and running parallel to the \Delta direction. The first hole and the electron branches result from the hybridization of Ni d with Si p states, whereas the second hole branch also has the contribution of Y (Lu) d orbitals. Thus, the two large cylindrical branches are most likely responsible for the observed superconductivity in these systems.

Finally, we have also calculated the phononic properties of these compounds, such as the phonon dispersion relation, the partial density of states F(\omega), and the spectrum function \omega^{-2}F(\omega). We did not include the SOC in the calculation of the vibrational properties because the crystal structure and the FS are not affected by this interaction. The primitive cell of these systems contains ten atoms; therefore the phonon spectrum contains 3 acoustic and 27 optical branches as shown in Fig. 12. Although the dispersion relation and partial F(\omega) show an almost continuous distribution of modes across the whole frequency range, we can divide the phonon spectrum into three frequency regions: acoustic (0-4.0 and 0-3.2 THz for YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3}, respectively), intermediate (4.0-12.2 and 2.6-12.8 THz), and high (12.2-14.5 and 12.8-14.6 THz). The acoustic branches are made up from states of all the atoms almost evenly for YNiSi_{3}, whereas there is an appreciable increment of the Lu contribution in the case of LuNiSi_{3} due to its heavy mass. The intermediate-frequency range has 23 branches where 12 of these (up to approximately 6.7 THz) form the low-lying optical branches. These 12 branches are built up by states coming from all the atoms with Y (Lu) and Si contributions being larger than the Ni one. The remaining 11 intermediate branches are mainly made up of Si contributions and a small contribution of Ni states. The four branches forming the high-frequency region are almost solely formed by Si contributions.

From F(\omega), we can also obtain the spectrum function \omega^{-2}F(\omega), that can be used as a crude alternative to the Eliashberg function \alpha^{2}F(\omega); these two spectral functions exhibit a similar peak structure [53]. We can observe that \omega^{-2}F(\omega) has its larger spectral weight in the acoustical and low-lying optical branches for both compounds with its more prominent peaks located around the latter as is shown in Fig. 12. These 12 branches have contributions from the vibrations of all atoms [Y(Lu), Ni, Si], indicating that the coupling between the d electrons from Y(Lu) and Ni to Si p electrons will form Cooper pairs, therefore, they are responsible for the observed superconductivity of these compounds.

## V Discussion

To summarize, both YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} present bulk superconductivity, showing the features of type-I superconductors with \kappa=0.113(11) for YNiSi_{3} and \kappa=0.42(4) for LuNiSi_{3}. The main superconducting parameters for both compounds are given in Table 3.

The discovery of type-I superconductivity in ternary compounds is not unprecedented with recent publications reporting the appearance of type-I superconductivity in the cage compound LaTi_{2}Al_{20}[11] and in the NCS LaPdSi_{3}[12] and LaIrSi_{3}[13] compounds. The case of the NCS LaRhSi_{3} is even more intriguing since it has been recently reported as a type-II/1 superconductor with \kappa=0.25[24, 26]. This compound has a phase diagram with resistivity and susceptibility measurements giving an exceptionally high upper critical field (\approx120 mT) compared to H_{\rm c}(0) obtained from standard specific-heat and magnetization measurements (\approx20 mT), interpreted as arising from surface superconductivity.

Figure 11: (a) FBZ of the space-group Cmmm. The main symmetry points and lines are labeled in black and red, respectively. (b) Extended Fermi surface of YNiSi_{3}. The FBZ is shown by black lines, and it is oriented along the \Delta direction (k_{y}). (c) Extended Fermi surface of LuNiSi_{3}.

  DFT results show that both YNiSi_{3} and LuNiSi_{3} have a nonmagnetic ground state and that, although SOC does not affect the FS of these compounds, SOC does act significantly on the Lu f states below the Fermi level resulting in a large splitting of these orbitals that overcomes the insignificant crystal-field splitting. ELF shows that for both compounds there are three types of atomic bonding: metallic, covalent, and ionic. The metallic bond is observed between Lu(Y) and Si on the (002) plane and the Ni and Si atoms on the (001) plane. The electronic structure indicates that these compounds are good conductors along the [100] and [001] directions but not along [010]. From the FS, we find that the second hole branch is built up by hybridization of Y(Lu) d, Ni d, and Si p states, whereas Ni d and Si p states hybridize to form the electron branch. These branches connect the FBZ boundaries and are responsible for the observed superconductivity. The partial F(\omega) and spectrum function \omega^{-2}F(\omega) indicate that the coupling of Y(Lu), Ni d, and Si p electrons in the low-lying optical phonon branches will form the Cooper pairs responsible of the superconducting state. These findings show that these compounds are anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) metals with a multiband superconducting state.

The larger spectral weight \omega^{-2}F(\omega) present in LuNiSi_{3} for the low-lying optical branches together with the large \eta_{\rm F} might explain the higher critical temperature seen in LuNiSi_{3}.

## VI VI. Conclusion

We have reported the discovery of superconductivity in YNiSi_{3} [T_{\rm c} = 1.36(3) K] and LuNiSi_{3} [T_{\rm c} = 1.61(2) K] by characterizing the superconducting behaviors of single crystals through magnetization, heat-capacity, and resistivity experiments with support from DFT band-structure calculations. Both compounds show bulk superconductivity with features that are typical of type-I SC but with a low jump in the specific heat [\Delta C_{\rm el}/\gamma_{\rm a}T_{\rm c} is equal to 1.14(9) and 0.71(5) for the Y and Lu compounds, respectively]. Resistivity measurements show a highly anisotropic behavior between the measurements under an applied field with the configuration H\perp b displaying the highest critical fields. DFT calculations show that these compounds are anisotropic 3D metals with a multiband superconducting ground state.
