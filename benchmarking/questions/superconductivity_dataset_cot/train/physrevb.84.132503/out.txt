###### Abstract

We report microwave surface impedances of FeSe0.4Te0.6 single crystals measured at 12, 19, and 44 GHz. The penetration depth exhibits a power-law behavior, \delta\lambda_{L}=\lambda_{L}(T)-\lambda_{L}(0)\propto CT^{\alpha} with an exponent n\simeq 2, which is considered to result from impurity scattering. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density largely deviates from the behavior expected in the BCS theory. We believe that this deviation is caused by the crossover from the dirty regime near T_{c} to the clean regime at low temperatures, which is supported by the rapid increase of the quasiparticle scattering time obtained from the microwave conductivity. We also believe that the previously published data of the superfluid density can be interpreted in this scenario.

Iron-based superconductors have attracted much attention since the discovery of LaFeAsO1_{-x}F_{x} with T_{c}=28 K. [1] These compounds are expected to have an unconventional pairing mechanism because they contain Fe, one of the most familiar ferromagnetic elements. Indeed, there have been many studies on various pairing symmetries of iron-based superconductors. [2, 3, 4, 5] The penetration depth studies have also suggested that the details of the pairing symmetry depend on the materials. [6, 7, 8, 9]

However, the estimates of the value of the superconducting gaps are inconsistent among different groups even in the same compounds. [2] One reason is that the temperature dependence of the superfluid densities n_{s}(T) in some compounds cannot be understood in the framework of the BCS model. A typical example is n_{s}(T) in FeSe0.4Te0.6, which we focus on in this Brief Report. FeSe0.4Te0.6 [10] (T_{c}=14 K) (the so-called 11 system) has the simplest crystal structure (PbO-type) among all iron-based superconductors. This compound does not contain arsenic, which is common in most iron-based superconductors, but the electronic structure of this system is similar to that of the FeAs layers. [11] It was suggested that n_{s}(T) in Fe1.03Se0.37Te0.63 can be fitted by a two gap model that takes into account interband scattering. [12] However, the model is based on the assumption that the sample is within the clean limit. In the 11 system, unlike ordinary metals, the resistivity of the material shows a small temperature dependence and has a relatively large value in the normal state: \rho(15\text{ K})\simeq 0.5\text{ m}\Omega cm. [13, 14, 15] Thus it is possible that there are unusual characteristics of quasiparticle scattering that affect the superconductivity and that produce some anomalous superconducting features. We believe that the microwave conductivity measurement is needed to evaluate the quasiparticle scattering in the superconducting state. In this Brief Report, we present the results of surface impedance measurements in FeSe0.4Te0.6 single crystals, from which we extracted the microwave conductivity \sigma and n_{s}. Then, we show that the crossover from the dirty regime near T_{c} to the clean regime at low temperatures can affect n_{s}(T). We believe that the scenario is applicable to many other iron-based superconductors that have the "dirty" nature in the normal state.

The single crystals with nominal composition FeSe0.4Te0.6 were grown by the Bridgman method with annealing. [13, 14, 15] Composition analysis by the energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) method revealed that the actual Se/Te ratio is approximately \text{Se}:\text{Te}=1:2. Although we could not know the exact amount of excess irons, since EDX analysis has an error of several percent, we did not observe significant Fe nonstoichiometry. We estimate excess iron in our samples is 3% at most, because our samples showed similar transport properties to the good superconducting sample in Ref. [16]. The transition temperature determined from dc magnetic susceptibility is T_{c}=14 K with the width \Delta T<0.5 K, which is rather sharp.

The surface impedance Z_{s}=R_{s}-iX_{s}, where R_{s} is the surface resistance and X_{s} is the surface reactance, was measured by a cavity perturbation technique. We used three kinds of cylindrical oxygen-free Cu cavity resonators, operated in the TE011 mode at 12, 19, and 44 GHz, which have a quality factor, Q\sim 60\,000 (12 GHz, 19 GHz), and 26 000 (44 GHz), respectively. A piece of crystal is mounted on a sapphire rod and is placed in the antinode of the microwave magnetic field H_{\omega}. H_{\omega} is parallel to the c axis, so that the shielding current flows in the ab planes. In this technique, one measures the changes of Q and the resonant frequency f of the cavity, which are caused by introducing a sufficiently small sample. The shifts in the inverse of Q and f are proportional to R_{s} and X_{s}, respectively. The absolute values of Z_{s} were obtained by assuming the Hagen-Rubens limit (\omega\tau\ll 1), where R_{s}=X_{s}=(\mu_{0}\omega\rho/2)^{\frac{1}{3}} above T_{c} (\omega=2\pi f is the angular frequency, \tau is the quasiparticle scattering time, and \mu_{0} is the permeability in vacuum).

For the case of local electrodynamics, we can extract \sigma from Z_{s} using the relation Z_{s}=(-i\mu_{0}\omega/\sigma)^{\frac{1}{3}}. In the two-fluid model, \sigma is expressed as

\[\sigma=\sigma_{1}+i\sigma_{2}=\frac{n_{n}e^{2}\tau}{m^{*}}\frac{1}{1-i\omega \tau}+i\frac{n_{s}e^{2}}{m^{*}\omega},\] (1)

where we assume the Drude-like normal fluid, e is the electric charge, and n_{n}/m^{*} and n_{s}/m^{*} are the normal fluid and the superfluid density over the effective mass, respectively. At low  temperatures and at low frequencies, the assumption \sigma_{1}\ll\sigma_{2} is valid, and one obtains the relation

\[X_{s}=\mu_{0}\omega\lambda_{L},\] (2)

where \lambda_{L} is the London penetration depth. Since \lambda_{L} is related to n_{s} via the London equation \lambda_{L}^{-2}=\mu_{0}n_{s}e^{2}/m^{*}, \lambda_{L}(T) at low temperatures will give us information about the superconducting gap structure, particularly the presence or the absence of nodes in the gap.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of Z_{s} at the three frequencies. In general, R_{s} increases as the frequency increases. However, in our samples, crystal 3 at 44 GHz measurement shows the lowest R_{s} at 1.6 K. This result indicates that the main contribution to the residual surface resistance R_{s}^{\rm res} has an extrinsic origin. The surface impedance measurements are susceptible to defects on the sample surface. For layered conductors in general, the presence of delaminated edges on the sample is reported to cause excess loss of microwave power.[17] Thus we expect the thicker samples to show larger values of R_{s}^{\rm res}. In fact, crystal 3, which was cleaved from 2 after the 12 and 19 GHz measurements, is the thinnest among the samples and has the lowest R_{s}^{\rm res}, which agrees with the above expectation.

Figure 2 shows \lambda_{L}(T) for crystal 2 at low temperatures. The absolute value of \lambda_{L} at 0 K is \lambda_{L}(0)\simeq 470 nm, which is in fair agreement with the other measurements.[12; 18] The penetration depth is found to behave in a power-law manner, \delta\lambda_{L}\equiv\lambda_{L}(T)-\lambda_{L}(0)\propto CT^{n}, with the exponent n\simeq 2. This behavior is also consistent with the previous electrodynamic study in the MHz region.[12; 18] In general, a power-law temperature dependence implies the presence of low-energy quasiparticle excitations. In this case, the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) behaves as D(E)\propto E^{n} close to the Fermi level, where E is the quasiparticle energy. At first sight, our result might seems to be inconsistent with a very flat DOS observed in an scanningl tunneling microscopy (STM) study.[19] However, impurity scattering can cause quadratic temperature dependence. It has been shown that, in a two-band superconductor with s_{\pm}-wave symmetry with nonmagnetic impurities, the behavior of \lambda_{L} at low temperature is essentially the same as in a conventional s-wave superconductor with a considerable amount of magnetic impurities.[20] However, our samples might contain both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities. Thus we cannot determine whether sign change exists or not from this experiment.

Figure 3(a) shows \sigma_{1}(T) in the superconducting state. By subtracting R_{s}^{\rm res} from the raw data of R_{s} before calculating \sigma, we can avoid the influence of surface defects and precisely discuss the quasiparticle dynamics. It should be noted that a small error in estimating R_{s}^{\rm res} does not change the essential feature of \sigma_{1}(T) at large. In all samples, a considerable enhancement of \sigma_{1} was observed below T_{c}. Although the magnitude of the peak is somewhat different between the two samples (see the 12 GHz data), it tends to decrease with increasing frequency. It is well known that in the clean limit of the BCS superconductors, \sigma_{1}(T) has a coherence peak. However, the peaks observed in our \sigma_{1}(T) data are

Figure 1: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the microwave surface impedance of FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} single crystals, Z_{s}=R_{s}-iX_{s}, at 12, 19, and 44 GHz, respectively. All samples were from the same batch. Crystal 1 (with dimensions 1.0\times 1.0\times 0.1 mm^{3}, T_{c}=14 K) shows a sharper superconducting transition than crystal 2 (0.7\times 0.5\times 0.1 mm^{3} for 12 and 19 GHz, T_{c}=13.5 K) and crystal 3 (0.5\times 0.3\times 0.05 mm^{3} for 44 GHz, T_{c}=13.5 K). The inset shows \rho(T) near T_{c} measured before cutting into small pieces for cavity measurements.

  much larger and broader than the coherence peak. Such peaks were also observed in the cuprate superconductors [21, 22, 23] and in other iron-based superconductors. [6, 7] Below T_{c}, quasiparticle scattering is suppressed because the quasiparticle DOS near the Fermi level decreases by the emergence of the superconducting gap, giving rise to the peak in \sigma_{1}(T) below T_{c}.

Since the coherence effect is not important in this system, we used the two-fluid model [see Eq. (1)] to extract \tau and n_{s} as follows:

\[\omega\tau=\frac{\sigma_{1}}{1-\bar{\sigma_{2}}},\] (3) \[\frac{n_{s}(T)}{n_{s}(0)}=\bar{\sigma_{2}}-\frac{\bar{\sigma_{1}^{ 2}}}{1-\bar{\sigma_{2}}},\] (4)

where we assume that all carriers condense at T=0 K. We also introduced the dimensionless conductivity \bar{\sigma}=\bar{\sigma_{1}}+i\bar{\sigma_{2}}=\mu_{0}\omega\lambda_{L}^{2}(0 )(\sigma_{1}+i\sigma_{2}). Figure 3(b) shows the temperature dependences of \tau. As anticipated, we found the rapid increase in \tau in all samples below T_{c}. The magnitude of the peak in \sigma_{1}(T) reflects the degree of impurity scattering. In crystal 1, which has a larger peak than 2, \tau increases more rapidly than in 2. The quasiparticle scattering time \tau in crystal 1 reaches more than 10 ps far below T_{c}. This value is two orders of magnitude larger than that in the normal state and is comparable to that in LiFeAs in the superconducting state. [24]

We find that \tau depends on frequency. As frequency decreases, \tau increases more rapidly in the superconducting state. Although we do not completely understand the origin of this frequency dependence, it might be related to the energy dependence of the DOS near the Fermi level. It is consistent with the observation that the frequency dependence is more profound at higher temperatures, where the number of thermally excited quasiparticles increases.

Next, we discuss n_{s}(T). When Eq. (2) is valid, n_{s}(T) is given by n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0)=\lambda_{L}(0)^{2}/\lambda_{L}(T)^{2}=X_{s}(0)^{2}/X_{s}(T)^ {2}. However, there was some deviation from Eq. (2) at the highest measurement frequency, 44 GHz, and in the temperature range of 6-14 K, since the normal fluid contribution to X_{s} is not negligible. In this case, we have to consider the quasiparticle dynamics by analyzing \sigma data using Eq. (4). Figure 4 shows n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) in crystal 2, which is very much different from that of the BCS superconductors. It is clear that this is convex downward in a wide temperature range. Near T_{c}, n_{s} increases very slowly with decreasing temperature, but this is irrelevant to the sample inhomogeneity such as the spatial distribution of Se content, because our samples show a rather sharp superconducting transition. In addition, damaged edges have almost no effect on n_{s}(T). [25] For the conventional s-wave superconductors, such temperature dependence does not appear whether they are in the clean limit or the dirty limit. [26] This behavior is sometimes interpreted as a characteristic of multigap superconductors having at least one very small gap. If we try to fit the data by a two-gap model, where n_{s}(T)=xn_{s1}(T)+(1-x)n_{s2}(T) (0<x<1), we get the gap value 2\Delta\simeq 1.7\,k_{B}T_{c} for both gaps, which is much smaller than the value 2\Delta=3.6\,k_{B}T_{c} clearly measured by STM. [19] This discrepancy indicates that the fitting using a simple two-gap model does not work for FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6}.

To explain this peculiar temperature dependence, we have to clarify whether FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} is a clean superconductor or not by comparing the electric mean free path l with the

Figure 4: (Color online) Temperature dependences of the superfluid density n_{s} in FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} and LiFeAs. [24] For clarity, only the 19 GHz data for crystal 2 are shown. The black solid (dashed) line is a curve expected for a conventional superconductor with 2\Delta=3.5k_{B}T_{c} in the clean (dirty) limit. The red solid curve is a fit to clean s wave from 0.3T_{c} to T_{c}.

  coherence length \xi. We can calculate l=v_{F}\tau with the Fermi velocity v_{F} measured by the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}.[27] In ARPES, a very small v_{F} is observed for the outer hole pocket (\alpha_{3}) centered at the \Gamma point and the electron pocket at the M point. With v_{F}\simeq 1.4\times 10^{-4} m/s for the \alpha_{3} pocket, l is about 7 A just above T_{c}. This is half of the coherence length, \xi\sim 15 A, estimated from an upper critical field measurement.[18, 28] Thus the sample is in the dirty regime near T_{c}. As the temperature decreases, l extends with the rapid increase in \tau, and l>100 A at 0.5T_{c}, which shows that the sample is in the clean limit.

Therefore, the behavior of n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) can be understood as follows: only a small amount of quasiparticle collapses into the condensate near T_{c} because l\simeq\xi. At sufficiently low temperatures, the sample enters the clean limit, where n_{s} increases with a massive loss of conductivity spectral weight, resulting in an n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) with a positive curvature. To summarize, it is important for n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) in FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} that there is a crossover from the dirty regime to the clean regime in the superconducting state, with decreasing temperature. This interpretation can be applied also to other iron-based superconductors, such as the doped compounds Ba(Fe,Co)_{2}As_{2}[29] and (Ba,K)Fe_{2}As_{2},[7] where similar temperature dependence is often observed. Furthermore, the report on (Ba,K)Fe_{2}As_{2}, which showed that n_{s}(T) changes dramatically with a small impurity concentration,[7] can be understood as a result of the increase of \xi/l near T_{c}. On the other hand, as for the stoichiometric LiFeAs, which shows \xi/l<1 even above T_{c}, n_{s}(T) can be fitted by a simple two-gap model[24] because the samples are in the clean regime at all temperatures below T_{c}. For more quantitative analysis, we need to consider the multiband nature. For example, extending the two-gap model beyond the clean limit will reveal the value of superconducting gaps.

In conclusion, we have measured Z_{s} of FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} single crystals. The quadratic temperature dependence of \lambda_{L} indicates the presence of impurity scattering. In the superconducting state, an enhancement of \sigma_{1} caused by the rapid increase of \tau was observed. The temperature dependence of superfluid density n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) shows a positive curvature in most of the temperature regime measured because the crystals are not in the clean limit near T_{c} and only become clean below T_{c}. This behavior indicates that one should carefully assess the relation between l and \xi in discussing n_{s}(T) in iron-based superconductors.

We appreciate Noriyuki Nakai and Tetsuo Hanaguri for fruitful discussions.

###### Abstract

We report microwave surface impedances of FeSe0.4Te0.6 single crystals measured at 12, 19, and 44 GHz. The penetration depth exhibits a power-law behavior, \delta\lambda_{L}=\lambda_{L}(T)-\lambda_{L}(0)\propto CT^{\alpha} with an exponent n\simeq 2, which is considered to result from impurity scattering. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density largely deviates from the behavior expected in the BCS theory. We believe that this deviation is caused by the crossover from the dirty regime near T_{c} to the clean regime at low temperatures, which is supported by the rapid increase of the quasiparticle scattering time obtained from the microwave conductivity. We also believe that the previously published data of the superfluid density can be interpreted in this scenario.

Iron-based superconductors have attracted much attention since the discovery of LaFeAsO1_{-x}F_{x} with T_{c}=28 K. [1] These compounds are expected to have an unconventional pairing mechanism because they contain Fe, one of the most familiar ferromagnetic elements. Indeed, there have been many studies on various pairing symmetries of iron-based superconductors. [2, 3, 4, 5] The penetration depth studies have also suggested that the details of the pairing symmetry depend on the materials. [6, 7, 8, 9]

However, the estimates of the value of the superconducting gaps are inconsistent among different groups even in the same compounds. [2] One reason is that the temperature dependence of the superfluid densities n_{s}(T) in some compounds cannot be understood in the framework of the BCS model. A typical example is n_{s}(T) in FeSe0.4Te0.6, which we focus on in this Brief Report. FeSe0.4Te0.6 [10] (T_{c}=14 K) (the so-called 11 system) has the simplest crystal structure (PbO-type) among all iron-based superconductors. This compound does not contain arsenic, which is common in most iron-based superconductors, but the electronic structure of this system is similar to that of the FeAs layers. [11] It was suggested that n_{s}(T) in Fe1.03Se0.37Te0.63 can be fitted by a two gap model that takes into account interband scattering. [12] However, the model is based on the assumption that the sample is within the clean limit. In the 11 system, unlike ordinary metals, the resistivity of the material shows a small temperature dependence and has a relatively large value in the normal state: \rho(15\text{ K})\simeq 0.5\text{ m}\Omega cm. [13, 14, 15] Thus it is possible that there are unusual characteristics of quasiparticle scattering that affect the superconductivity and that produce some anomalous superconducting features. We believe that the microwave conductivity measurement is needed to evaluate the quasiparticle scattering in the superconducting state. In this Brief Report, we present the results of surface impedance measurements in FeSe0.4Te0.6 single crystals, from which we extracted the microwave conductivity \sigma and n_{s}. Then, we show that the crossover from the dirty regime near T_{c} to the clean regime at low temperatures can affect n_{s}(T). We believe that the scenario is applicable to many other iron-based superconductors that have the "dirty" nature in the normal state.

The single crystals with nominal composition FeSe0.4Te0.6 were grown by the Bridgman method with annealing. [13, 14, 15] Composition analysis by the energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) method revealed that the actual Se/Te ratio is approximately \text{Se}:\text{Te}=1:2. Although we could not know the exact amount of excess irons, since EDX analysis has an error of several percent, we did not observe significant Fe nonstoichiometry. We estimate excess iron in our samples is 3% at most, because our samples showed similar transport properties to the good superconducting sample in Ref. [16]. The transition temperature determined from dc magnetic susceptibility is T_{c}=14 K with the width \Delta T<0.5 K, which is rather sharp.

The surface impedance Z_{s}=R_{s}-iX_{s}, where R_{s} is the surface resistance and X_{s} is the surface reactance, was measured by a cavity perturbation technique. We used three kinds of cylindrical oxygen-free Cu cavity resonators, operated in the TE011 mode at 12, 19, and 44 GHz, which have a quality factor, Q\sim 60\,000 (12 GHz, 19 GHz), and 26 000 (44 GHz), respectively. A piece of crystal is mounted on a sapphire rod and is placed in the antinode of the microwave magnetic field H_{\omega}. H_{\omega} is parallel to the c axis, so that the shielding current flows in the ab planes. In this technique, one measures the changes of Q and the resonant frequency f of the cavity, which are caused by introducing a sufficiently small sample. The shifts in the inverse of Q and f are proportional to R_{s} and X_{s}, respectively. The absolute values of Z_{s} were obtained by assuming the Hagen-Rubens limit (\omega\tau\ll 1), where R_{s}=X_{s}=(\mu_{0}\omega\rho/2)^{\frac{1}{3}} above T_{c} (\omega=2\pi f is the angular frequency, \tau is the quasiparticle scattering time, and \mu_{0} is the permeability in vacuum).

For the case of local electrodynamics, we can extract \sigma from Z_{s} using the relation Z_{s}=(-i\mu_{0}\omega/\sigma)^{\frac{1}{3}}. In the two-fluid model, \sigma is expressed as

\[\sigma=\sigma_{1}+i\sigma_{2}=\frac{n_{n}e^{2}\tau}{m^{*}}\frac{1}{1-i\omega \tau}+i\frac{n_{s}e^{2}}{m^{*}\omega},\] (1)

where we assume the Drude-like normal fluid, e is the electric charge, and n_{n}/m^{*} and n_{s}/m^{*} are the normal fluid and the superfluid density over the effective mass, respectively. At low  temperatures and at low frequencies, the assumption \sigma_{1}\ll\sigma_{2} is valid, and one obtains the relation

\[X_{s}=\mu_{0}\omega\lambda_{L},\] (2)

where \lambda_{L} is the London penetration depth. Since \lambda_{L} is related to n_{s} via the London equation \lambda_{L}^{-2}=\mu_{0}n_{s}e^{2}/m^{*}, \lambda_{L}(T) at low temperatures will give us information about the superconducting gap structure, particularly the presence or the absence of nodes in the gap.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of Z_{s} at the three frequencies. In general, R_{s} increases as the frequency increases. However, in our samples, crystal 3 at 44 GHz measurement shows the lowest R_{s} at 1.6 K. This result indicates that the main contribution to the residual surface resistance R_{s}^{\rm res} has an extrinsic origin. The surface impedance measurements are susceptible to defects on the sample surface. For layered conductors in general, the presence of delaminated edges on the sample is reported to cause excess loss of microwave power.[17] Thus we expect the thicker samples to show larger values of R_{s}^{\rm res}. In fact, crystal 3, which was cleaved from 2 after the 12 and 19 GHz measurements, is the thinnest among the samples and has the lowest R_{s}^{\rm res}, which agrees with the above expectation.

Figure 2 shows \lambda_{L}(T) for crystal 2 at low temperatures. The absolute value of \lambda_{L} at 0 K is \lambda_{L}(0)\simeq 470 nm, which is in fair agreement with the other measurements.[12; 18] The penetration depth is found to behave in a power-law manner, \delta\lambda_{L}\equiv\lambda_{L}(T)-\lambda_{L}(0)\propto CT^{n}, with the exponent n\simeq 2. This behavior is also consistent with the previous electrodynamic study in the MHz region.[12; 18] In general, a power-law temperature dependence implies the presence of low-energy quasiparticle excitations. In this case, the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) behaves as D(E)\propto E^{n} close to the Fermi level, where E is the quasiparticle energy. At first sight, our result might seems to be inconsistent with a very flat DOS observed in an scanningl tunneling microscopy (STM) study.[19] However, impurity scattering can cause quadratic temperature dependence. It has been shown that, in a two-band superconductor with s_{\pm}-wave symmetry with nonmagnetic impurities, the behavior of \lambda_{L} at low temperature is essentially the same as in a conventional s-wave superconductor with a considerable amount of magnetic impurities.[20] However, our samples might contain both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities. Thus we cannot determine whether sign change exists or not from this experiment.

Figure 3(a) shows \sigma_{1}(T) in the superconducting state. By subtracting R_{s}^{\rm res} from the raw data of R_{s} before calculating \sigma, we can avoid the influence of surface defects and precisely discuss the quasiparticle dynamics. It should be noted that a small error in estimating R_{s}^{\rm res} does not change the essential feature of \sigma_{1}(T) at large. In all samples, a considerable enhancement of \sigma_{1} was observed below T_{c}. Although the magnitude of the peak is somewhat different between the two samples (see the 12 GHz data), it tends to decrease with increasing frequency. It is well known that in the clean limit of the BCS superconductors, \sigma_{1}(T) has a coherence peak. However, the peaks observed in our \sigma_{1}(T) data are

Figure 1: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the microwave surface impedance of FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} single crystals, Z_{s}=R_{s}-iX_{s}, at 12, 19, and 44 GHz, respectively. All samples were from the same batch. Crystal 1 (with dimensions 1.0\times 1.0\times 0.1 mm^{3}, T_{c}=14 K) shows a sharper superconducting transition than crystal 2 (0.7\times 0.5\times 0.1 mm^{3} for 12 and 19 GHz, T_{c}=13.5 K) and crystal 3 (0.5\times 0.3\times 0.05 mm^{3} for 44 GHz, T_{c}=13.5 K). The inset shows \rho(T) near T_{c} measured before cutting into small pieces for cavity measurements.

  much larger and broader than the coherence peak. Such peaks were also observed in the cuprate superconductors [21, 22, 23] and in other iron-based superconductors. [6, 7] Below T_{c}, quasiparticle scattering is suppressed because the quasiparticle DOS near the Fermi level decreases by the emergence of the superconducting gap, giving rise to the peak in \sigma_{1}(T) below T_{c}.

Since the coherence effect is not important in this system, we used the two-fluid model [see Eq. (1)] to extract \tau and n_{s} as follows:

\[\omega\tau=\frac{\sigma_{1}}{1-\bar{\sigma_{2}}},\] (3) \[\frac{n_{s}(T)}{n_{s}(0)}=\bar{\sigma_{2}}-\frac{\bar{\sigma_{1}^{ 2}}}{1-\bar{\sigma_{2}}},\] (4)

where we assume that all carriers condense at T=0 K. We also introduced the dimensionless conductivity \bar{\sigma}=\bar{\sigma_{1}}+i\bar{\sigma_{2}}=\mu_{0}\omega\lambda_{L}^{2}(0 )(\sigma_{1}+i\sigma_{2}). Figure 3(b) shows the temperature dependences of \tau. As anticipated, we found the rapid increase in \tau in all samples below T_{c}. The magnitude of the peak in \sigma_{1}(T) reflects the degree of impurity scattering. In crystal 1, which has a larger peak than 2, \tau increases more rapidly than in 2. The quasiparticle scattering time \tau in crystal 1 reaches more than 10 ps far below T_{c}. This value is two orders of magnitude larger than that in the normal state and is comparable to that in LiFeAs in the superconducting state. [24]

We find that \tau depends on frequency. As frequency decreases, \tau increases more rapidly in the superconducting state. Although we do not completely understand the origin of this frequency dependence, it might be related to the energy dependence of the DOS near the Fermi level. It is consistent with the observation that the frequency dependence is more profound at higher temperatures, where the number of thermally excited quasiparticles increases.

Next, we discuss n_{s}(T). When Eq. (2) is valid, n_{s}(T) is given by n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0)=\lambda_{L}(0)^{2}/\lambda_{L}(T)^{2}=X_{s}(0)^{2}/X_{s}(T)^ {2}. However, there was some deviation from Eq. (2) at the highest measurement frequency, 44 GHz, and in the temperature range of 6-14 K, since the normal fluid contribution to X_{s} is not negligible. In this case, we have to consider the quasiparticle dynamics by analyzing \sigma data using Eq. (4). Figure 4 shows n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) in crystal 2, which is very much different from that of the BCS superconductors. It is clear that this is convex downward in a wide temperature range. Near T_{c}, n_{s} increases very slowly with decreasing temperature, but this is irrelevant to the sample inhomogeneity such as the spatial distribution of Se content, because our samples show a rather sharp superconducting transition. In addition, damaged edges have almost no effect on n_{s}(T). [25] For the conventional s-wave superconductors, such temperature dependence does not appear whether they are in the clean limit or the dirty limit. [26] This behavior is sometimes interpreted as a characteristic of multigap superconductors having at least one very small gap. If we try to fit the data by a two-gap model, where n_{s}(T)=xn_{s1}(T)+(1-x)n_{s2}(T) (0<x<1), we get the gap value 2\Delta\simeq 1.7\,k_{B}T_{c} for both gaps, which is much smaller than the value 2\Delta=3.6\,k_{B}T_{c} clearly measured by STM. [19] This discrepancy indicates that the fitting using a simple two-gap model does not work for FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6}.

To explain this peculiar temperature dependence, we have to clarify whether FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} is a clean superconductor or not by comparing the electric mean free path l with the

Figure 4: (Color online) Temperature dependences of the superfluid density n_{s} in FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} and LiFeAs. [24] For clarity, only the 19 GHz data for crystal 2 are shown. The black solid (dashed) line is a curve expected for a conventional superconductor with 2\Delta=3.5k_{B}T_{c} in the clean (dirty) limit. The red solid curve is a fit to clean s wave from 0.3T_{c} to T_{c}.

  coherence length \xi. We can calculate l=v_{F}\tau with the Fermi velocity v_{F} measured by the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on FeSe_{0.5}Te_{0.5}.[27] In ARPES, a very small v_{F} is observed for the outer hole pocket (\alpha_{3}) centered at the \Gamma point and the electron pocket at the M point. With v_{F}\simeq 1.4\times 10^{-4} m/s for the \alpha_{3} pocket, l is about 7 A just above T_{c}. This is half of the coherence length, \xi\sim 15 A, estimated from an upper critical field measurement.[18, 28] Thus the sample is in the dirty regime near T_{c}. As the temperature decreases, l extends with the rapid increase in \tau, and l>100 A at 0.5T_{c}, which shows that the sample is in the clean limit.

Therefore, the behavior of n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) can be understood as follows: only a small amount of quasiparticle collapses into the condensate near T_{c} because l\simeq\xi. At sufficiently low temperatures, the sample enters the clean limit, where n_{s} increases with a massive loss of conductivity spectral weight, resulting in an n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) with a positive curvature. To summarize, it is important for n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) in FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} that there is a crossover from the dirty regime to the clean regime in the superconducting state, with decreasing temperature. This interpretation can be applied also to other iron-based superconductors, such as the doped compounds Ba(Fe,Co)_{2}As_{2}[29] and (Ba,K)Fe_{2}As_{2},[7] where similar temperature dependence is often observed. Furthermore, the report on (Ba,K)Fe_{2}As_{2}, which showed that n_{s}(T) changes dramatically with a small impurity concentration,[7] can be understood as a result of the increase of \xi/l near T_{c}. On the other hand, as for the stoichiometric LiFeAs, which shows \xi/l<1 even above T_{c}, n_{s}(T) can be fitted by a simple two-gap model[24] because the samples are in the clean regime at all temperatures below T_{c}. For more quantitative analysis, we need to consider the multiband nature. For example, extending the two-gap model beyond the clean limit will reveal the value of superconducting gaps.

In conclusion, we have measured Z_{s} of FeSe_{0.4}Te_{0.6} single crystals. The quadratic temperature dependence of \lambda_{L} indicates the presence of impurity scattering. In the superconducting state, an enhancement of \sigma_{1} caused by the rapid increase of \tau was observed. The temperature dependence of superfluid density n_{s}(T)/n_{s}(0) shows a positive curvature in most of the temperature regime measured because the crystals are not in the clean limit near T_{c} and only become clean below T_{c}. This behavior indicates that one should carefully assess the relation between l and \xi in discussing n_{s}(T) in iron-based superconductors.

We appreciate Noriyuki Nakai and Tetsuo Hanaguri for fruitful discussions.
