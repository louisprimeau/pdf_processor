###### Abstract

The phase diagram of the LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O system has been extensively studied through hole and electron doping as well as As/P substitution. It has been revealed that there are three different superconducting phases with different Fermi surface (FS) topologies and thus with possibly different pairing glues. One of them is well understood as spin fluctuation-mediated superconductivity within a FS nesting scenario. Another one with the FSs in a bad nesting condition must be explained in a different context such as orbital or spin fluctuation in a strongly correlated electronic system. In both phases, _T_-linear resistivity was commonly observed when the superconducting transition temperature _T_{c}_ becomes the highest value, indicating that the strength of bosonic fluctuation determines _T_{c}_. In the last superconducting phase, the nesting condition of FSs and the related bosonic fluctuation are moderate. Variety of phase diagram characterizes the multiple orbital nature of the iron-based superconductors which are just near the boundary between weak and strong correlation regimes.

Figure 1 shows the powder x-ray diffraction patterns for La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14} and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}. The diffraction pattern for LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{1-x}H with y=0.25 is very similar to that for y=0.30, and we only show the results of y=0.30 in Fig. 1. Almost all the diffraction peaks in Fig. 1 can be assigned to the calculated Bragg peaks for the tetragonal P4/nmm symmetry. The in-plane (a) and out-of-plane lattice constants (c) were obtained by the least squares fitting of the x-ray diffraction data.

The crystal structures of LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14} and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{1-x}H_{y} (y=0.25 and 0.30) were characterized by high resolution powder x-ray diffraction with the x-ray beam energy of 11.5 keV or 15 keV at room temperature at BL-8A/8B of Photon Factory in KEK, Japan. The lattice constants, pnictogen heights, and Pn-Fe-Pn bond angles were calculated from the measured data by Rietveld analysis [25]. The lattice constants estimated by Rietveld analysis are almost the same as those determined from powder x-ray diffraction data using Cu K\alpha radiation. La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O samples were easily decomposed in air, so we could not perform the powder x-ray diffraction experiments for these samples using synchrotron x-ray beam.

Electrical resistivity was measured by a standard four-probe method. T_{\rm c} of almost all samples was determined by zero resistivity. In La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, the onset temperature of resistive transition is also shown. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with SQUID magnetometer in an applied field of 10 Oe. The Knight shift and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) of ^{31}P-NMR were measured at the field of \sim11.93 T.

## III Results

In Figs. 2(a)-2(d) are plotted the lattice constants a and c as a function of P content x for La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25}, and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25}, and (d) LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.30} at room temperature. The x dependence of the pnictogen height from the Fe plane h_{Pn} and As/P-Fe-As/P bond angle \alpha of (e) LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, (f) LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.075}H_{0.25}, and (g) LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}.

The pnictogen height from the Fe plane h_{Pn} and As/P bond angle \alpha were estimated for LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25}, and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25}, and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}, as shown in Figs. 2(e)-2(g), respectively. The values of h_{Pn} and \alpha for x=0 (As 100%) are consistent with the previous work by Hosono and Matsuishi [22]. These quantities also linearly change with x. The increase of \alpha with x implies that P substitution does not uniformly shrink the lattice but deforms the Fe-As/P tetrahedron. This deformation of the Fe-As/P tetrahedron is considered to play a crucial role in the nonmonotonic changes of many physical properties that were observed in our previous studies [16, 17]. It is expected that the effect of tetrahedron deformation is different in different carrier doping levels. We show the results for each doping region.

First, we show the results of hole doped system, La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O. The temperature (T) dependences of resistivity (\rho) and magnetic susceptibility (\chi) of La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O are shown for various P contents in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The composition dependence of resistivity behavior is complicated. At x=1.0 (P 100%) resistivity is very low and exhibits a metallic T dependence. Superconductivity is observed around 5 K. When P concentration is reduced, resistivity slightly increases and T_{\rm c} increases up to \sim12 K at x=0.8. With further decreasing P content, superconductivity disappears and \rho(T) shows a kink at around 20 K. We consider that this kink feature corresponds to the AFM phase transition accompanied with the structural phase transition [26]. At lower P contents, the kink of \rho(T) disappears and

Almost all the diffraction peaks are indexed assuming the tetragonal structure with the P4/nmm symmetry. The peaks indicated by triangles are due to impurities.

  the superconductivity manifests itself again, for example, at 12 K at x=0.4. However, this superconducting composition region is very narrow and the other AFM phase appears below x=0.3. The superconductivity for x=0.4, 0.8, and x=1.0 was also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility.

Figure 3(c) illustrates the phase diagram of La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, T_{\rm c} and Neel temperature T_{N} being plotted as a function of x. We can clearly see two superconducting phases (SC1 and SC2) and two AFM phases (AFM1 and AFM2). This is very similar to the phase diagram of LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O [17, 27, 28] that is indicated in the same figure by open symbols and dashed curves. Although in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O the AFM state between x=0.4 and 0.7 was observed only by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) but not clearly seen in \rho(T)[17], it is visible in \rho(T) for the case of La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O. Therefore, we can safely conclude that there exists the second AFM phase (AFM2) between the two superconducting phases in the parent and hole doped compounds. The effect of hole doping is the expansion of the first AFM phase (AFM1) near x=0 and the shift of the first superconducting phase (SC1) to the higher x region.

In this work, the synchrotron x-ray diffraction could not be performed at low temperatures for La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O because the samples are easily decomposed. To confirm the structural phase transition together with the phase transition to AFM2 state in La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, a further diffraction study is required.

Next, the results for the electron doped system, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, are presented in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a)

The inset of top panel (a) shows the temperature (T) dependence of the electrical resistivity \rho for x=0.40 and 0.50 at low temperatures.

The blue and green circles indicate T_{\rm c} determined by zero resistivity and by the onset of resistive transition, respectively. T_{\rm c} and T_{N} of LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O in previous reports are also plotted in panel (c) by large open symbols [17] and small ones [27, 28]. Solid and broken lines are the guide for the eyes.

  shows the T dependence of resistivity for various x values. Roughly speaking, resistivity does not change with x so much. All the samples show a metallic T dependence of resistivity with a superconducting transition. Bulk superconductivity was also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The resistivity is the lowest at x=1.0, which is commonly observed in all the studied As/P substitution systems. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and the inset, the T dependence becomes almost linear, \rho(T)\simT, and T_{\rm c} shows a maximum value at x=0.4-0.5. At the lower and the higher P contents, T dependence approaches the Fermi liquid behavior \rho\sim T^{2}. The T_{\rm c} is plotted as a function of x in Fig. 4(c). In spite of the linear change of all the structure parameters [Figs. 2(b) and 2(e)], T_{\rm c} changes nonmonotonically with x, peaking at x=0.4-0.5.

Finally the results of heavily electron doped systems, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25} and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}, are examined. By using hydrogen, we could achieve the heavy electron doping in the 1111 system. The T dependences of resistivity for all the P compositions are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a). As is clearly seen, all the samples show metallic \rho(T) with very small resistivity values. For example, the residual resistivity is less than 250 \mu\Omega cm for all the compositions although the samples are polycrystals. As shown in Figs. 5(a), 5(b) 6(a), and 6(b), the superconductivity appears only around x=0 in these systems. The maximum T_{\rm c} (\sim35 K) is observed at x=0 (As 100%) for y=0.30. This value is higher than those for lower doping levels (y). The T_{\rm c} value for y=0.25 is much lower than the case of y=0.30.

When x is slightly increased, T_{\rm c} is rapidly suppressed and eventually disappears above x=0.2. The T_{\rm c} values of both H-doped systems are plotted as a function of x in Figs. 5(c) and 6(c). It should be noted that the nonsuperconducting samples with x>0.2 are not insulators but very good metals,

  exhibiting T^{2} resistivity. This suggests that there is no AFM phase in this compositional region.

## IV Discussion

All the data of T_{\text{c}} and T_{N} are summarized in Fig. 7(a), together with the results for F contents of y=0, 0.05, and 0.10 in our previous works [16, 17]. Here we can identify three superconducting regions. The first one (SC1) is near the AFM1 phase, while the second one (SC2) is close to the AFM2 phase. The last one (SC3) is located at very high H-doping compositions.

According to the band calculation [2], the Fermi surfaces of LaFeAsO are expected as illustrated in Fig. 7(b). Here the nesting between hole and electron FSs is crucial for spin fluctuation. Since the sizes of hole and electron FSs are comparable, the nesting condition is relatively good, which causes AFM order in AFM1. When holes are doped into the parent compound LaAsFeO, the hole FSs near the T point slightly expand while the electron FS near (\pm\pi, 0) or (0, \pm\pi) shrinks. This makes the nesting condition better, resulting in the stability of AFM1 phase. This could be the reason for the expansion of AFM1 phase with Sr substitution.

For LaFePO, the band calculation predicts that the d_{xy} FS near (\pi,\pi) is missing [2, 29]. [See Fig. 7(c).] Therefore, the nesting between d_{yz} and d_{xz} FS is important for spin fluctuation. The AFM2 phase is considered to be in a strong limit of this fluctuation. When electrons are doped, this spin correlation is weakened and the AFM2 phase vanishes. Instead, the SC2 phase emerges. Therefore, it is likely that the superconductivity in the SC2 phase is mediated by the two-dimensional spin fluctuation via the d_{yz}/d_{xz} FS nesting.

The strength of spin fluctuation can be monitored by the power (n) of T in resistivity \rho(T)= \rho_{0}+AT^{n}. The x dependence of n is summarized in Fig. 8. The fitting of \rho(T) was performed between 100 K and the onset temperature of resistive transition. The fitting parameters of \rho(T) for x=0.40, 0.50 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, and x=0 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}, where \rho(T)\simT as presented in Figs. 4(a) and 6(a), are shown as examples in the Appendix. In the electron doped systems with y=0.05, 0.10, and 0.14, n decreases from 2 (at x=1.0) to 1 with decreasing x. At the x composition where n\sim 1, T_{\text{c}} reaches a maximum value. This can be understood as follows. At x=1.0, spin fluctuation is weak and the system is close to the Fermi liquid. As x decreases, spin fluctuation strength increases and the system turns to a non-Fermi liquid state near the quantum critical point, where the T-linear resistivity and the T_{\text{c}} maximum are observed.

The T-linear resistivity is caused by some bosonic fluctuation but not necessarily by spin fluctuation. However, in the case of SC2, the corresponding AFM spin fluctuation was clearly observed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Figures 9(a)-9(d) are contour plots of the AFM fluctuation component of 1I/T_{1}T for various compositions, where T_{1} is a nuclear spin relaxation time estimated from

The contour lines of T_{\text{c}} are drawn by extrapolation on the basis of the data shown in Figs. 3(c), 4(c) 5(c), 6(c) and previous results [16, 17]. The dots indicate the position of materials that were actually synthesized.

  the ^{31}P-NMR experiment. Here we assume that (1/T_{1}T) is decomposed as (1/T_{1}T)=(1/T_{1}T)_{AFM}+(1/T_{1}T)_{0}[30]. The first term represents the strength of AFM fluctuation due to FS nesting, while the second one is q independent and proportional to the square of density of states at E_{F}. The second term was estimated by assuming that its T dependence is the same as that of K_{s}^{2}. Here, K_{s} is the spin part of Knight shift, which is proportional to the density of states at E_{F}. Figure 9 clearly demonstrates that the composition (x) region of the strong AFM fluctuation corresponds to the x region of high T_{\rm c} for y = 0.05, 0.10, and 0.14. It means that when the AFM fluctuation is enhanced, the T_{\rm c} is raised in the SC2 phase.

What is remarkable here is that even if the system approaches the quantum critical point with increasing As concentration it does not go into an AFM ordered phase but into another superconducting phase (SC1). As discussed in our previous paper, this is linked to the band crossover with As substitution, namely, the sinking down of d_{z}: band below E_{F} and the rising up of the d_{xy} band above E_{F}[16, 17].

Next, we discuss the SC3 phase. In the heavily electron doped state, the hole FS must be radically shrunk, while the electron FS is expanded [31]. [See Fig. 7(d).] The imbalance of FS sizes makes the nesting condition worse. In this circumstance, it is inappropriate to take the nesting scenario under the assumption of moderately electron correlation. Actually, the NMR measurement confirms that the low energy spin fluctuation is very weak in LaFeAs_{0.6}P_{0.4}O_{0.7}H_{0.3}. As shown in Fig. 9(e), the increase in the 1/T_{1}T due to AFM spin fluctuations, evaluated as |(1/T_{1}T)_{\rm AFM}|\sim 0.002, is significantly smaller than |(1/T_{1}T)_{\rm AFM}|\sim 0.07 at (x,y)= (0.40,0.10) that corresponds to the highest T_{\rm c} composition in SC2 phase. Note that the T-linear resistivity with high T_{\rm c} is observed at x = 0 for y = 0.30 [Fig. 8(e)], while the lower-T_{\rm c} samples for y = 0.25 and the nonsuperconducting ones for y = 0.25 and 0.30 show T^{2} or larger power law behavior of \rho(T). It means that a strong bosonic fluctuation governs the physical properties in the SC3 phase.

One of the candidates for this bosonic fluctuation is the spin fluctuation due to the next nearest neighbor hopping of d_{xy} orbital electrons [29, 31]. This is based on a strong electron correlation regime in real space, in contrast to the FS nesting picture in k space. According to this scenario, the rapid suppression of T_{\rm c} with increasing x can be explained by the disappearance of d_{xy} FS near (\pi,\pi), because this orbital mainly contributes to the spin fluctuation via the next nearest neighbor hopping. Since the system rapidly changes to the

The solid lines are the guide for the eyes.

  Fermi liquid with increasing x, electron correlation strongly depends on the orbitals forming FSs. Another possibility is superconductivity mediated by other bosonic fluctuation such as orbital fluctuation. The contribution of orbital degree of freedom has been widely discussed in the iron-based superconductors [9]. The electronic nematicity could be a smoking gun of orbital fluctuation [10, 11, 12].

Finally, we return to the discussion of SC1 phase. In this phase, it has been found that the spin fluctuation monitored by 1/_T_1T of NMR is not strongly enhanced at low temperatures [32]. The T dependence of resistivity also suggests a weaker bosonic fluctuation [16, 17]. The expected FSs are illustrated in Fig. 7(b). Here the nesting condition is moderate, as pointed out in Refs. [29, 31]. Usui and coworkers proposed that the spin fluctuation due to FS nesting (low energy limit) does not play a major role but the spin fluctuation due to finite energy hopping contributes to superconductivity. Actually the 1/_T_1T of NMR indicated that AFM spin fluctuation starts to develop at higher temperature in SC1 than in SC2, which may indicate the contribution of spin fluctuation with higher energy scale [30]. Because of the multiple-orbital character, various kinds of spin fluctuations with various energy scales are possibly involved in the superconductivity. Another possibility is the contribution of other bosonic fluctuation. To specify the pairing mechanism in this phase, further study is required.

## V Conclusion

We have systematically studied the As/P substitution effects on the electronic state of LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O for various carrier doping levels (y). In the hole-doped La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, the temperature-dependent resistivity indicates that there exist two AFM phases (AFM1 and AFM2) and two superconducting phases (SC1 and SC2) as in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O. In electron-doped LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O with the doping level of y=0.14, SC1 state is destabilized by heavy electron doping, while SC2 survives around x=0.40-0.50. In further electron-doped LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{1-x}H_{y} with y=0.30, another superconducting phase (SC3) appears at x\sim 0. In these regions of (x,y)=(0.40-0.50,0.14) and (0,\,0.30), resistivity shows non-Fermi-liquid behaviors, indicating the existence of strong bosonic fluctuation.

The extensive study over a wide x-y composition range has revealed three distinct superconducting phases with different FS topologies. One of them (SC2) can be well understood as the superconductivity mediated by AFM spin fluctuation via the nesting of d_{yz}d_{zx} FSs, because T_{\rm c} is clearly correlated with the spin fluctuation strength monitored by 1/_T_1T in NMR and the power n in \rho\sim T^{n}. The superconducting phase (SC3) in the heavily electron doped region should be considered in a strong correlation regime where the FS nesting scenario does not work. In this phase, a particular orbital (d_{xy}) seems to play a crucial role in superconductivity. In the last superconducting phase (SC1), the nesting condition is moderate and the bosonic fluctuation monitored by \rho(T) and 1/_T_1T is also moderate. Contribution of spin fluctuation with various energy scales is one of the possible candidates for pairing glue in SC1, although the possibility of other bosonic fluctuation cannot be excluded.

## Appendix

Here we provide the fitting parameters of temperature(T) dependent resistivity \rho(T) for the optimal T_{\rm c} samples (x=0.40, 0.50 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, and x=0 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}) to supplement the main text. As shown in Figs. 4(a) and 6(a), the \rho(T) can be expressed as \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n} at low temperatures, where \rho_{0} is residual resistivity, n the power of T, and A the coefficient. The fitting of \rho(T) was performed between 100 K and the onset T of resistive transition. Table 1 shows the fitting results of \rho_{0}, A, and n for x=0.40, 0.50 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14} and x=0 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}.

###### Abstract

The phase diagram of the LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O system has been extensively studied through hole and electron doping as well as As/P substitution. It has been revealed that there are three different superconducting phases with different Fermi surface (FS) topologies and thus with possibly different pairing glues. One of them is well understood as spin fluctuation-mediated superconductivity within a FS nesting scenario. Another one with the FSs in a bad nesting condition must be explained in a different context such as orbital or spin fluctuation in a strongly correlated electronic system. In both phases, _T_-linear resistivity was commonly observed when the superconducting transition temperature _T_{c}_ becomes the highest value, indicating that the strength of bosonic fluctuation determines _T_{c}_. In the last superconducting phase, the nesting condition of FSs and the related bosonic fluctuation are moderate. Variety of phase diagram characterizes the multiple orbital nature of the iron-based superconductors which are just near the boundary between weak and strong correlation regimes.

2017 14 March 20172017 8 June 2017 29 June 2017 14 March 2017 8 June 2017 29 June 2017 14 March 2017 8 June 2017 29 June 2017 14 March 2017 29 June 2017  All the samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction using Cu K\alpha radiation at room temperature. Figure 1 shows the powder x-ray diffraction patterns for La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14} and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}. The diffraction pattern for LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{1-x}H with y=0.25 is very similar to that for y=0.30, and we only show the results of y=0.30 in Fig. 1. Almost all the diffraction peaks in Fig. 1 can be assigned to the calculated Bragg peaks for the tetragonal P4/nmm symmetry. The in-plane (a) and out-of-plane lattice constants (c) were obtained by the least squares fitting of the x-ray diffraction data.

The crystal structures of LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14} and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{1-x}H_{y} (y=0.25 and 0.30) were characterized by high resolution powder x-ray diffraction with the x-ray beam energy of 11.5 keV or 15 keV at room temperature at BL-8A/8B of Photon Factory in KEK, Japan. The lattice constants, pnictogen heights, and Pn-Fe-Pn bond angles were calculated from the measured data by Rietveld analysis [25]. The lattice constants estimated by Rietveld analysis are almost the same as those determined from powder x-ray diffraction data using Cu K\alpha radiation. La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O samples were easily decomposed in air, so we could not perform the powder x-ray diffraction experiments for these samples using synchrotron x-ray beam.

Electrical resistivity was measured by a standard four-probe method. T_{\rm c} of almost all samples was determined by zero resistivity. In La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, the onset temperature of resistive transition is also shown. Magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with SQUID magnetometer in an applied field of 10 Oe. The Knight shift and the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) of ^{31}P-NMR were measured at the field of \sim11.93 T.

## III Results

In Figs. 2(a)-2(d) are plotted the lattice constants a and c as a function of P content x for La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25}, and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25}, and (d) LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.30} at room temperature. The x dependence of the pnictogen height from the Fe plane h_{Pn} and As/P-Fe-As/P bond angle \alpha of (e) LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, (f) LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.075}H_{0.25}, and (g) LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}.

The pnictogen height from the Fe plane h_{Pn} and As/P bond angle \alpha were estimated for LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25}, and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25}, and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}, as shown in Figs. 2(e)-2(g), respectively. The values of h_{Pn} and \alpha for x=0 (As 100%) are consistent with the previous work by Hosono and Matsuishi [22]. These quantities also linearly change with x. The increase of \alpha with x implies that P substitution does not uniformly shrink the lattice but deforms the Fe-As/P tetrahedron. This deformation of the Fe-As/P tetrahedron is considered to play a crucial role in the nonmonotonic changes of many physical properties that were observed in our previous studies [16, 17]. It is expected that the effect of tetrahedron deformation is different in different carrier doping levels. We show the results for each doping region.

First, we show the results of hole doped system, La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O. The temperature (T) dependences of resistivity (\rho) and magnetic susceptibility (\chi) of La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O are shown for various P contents in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. The composition dependence of resistivity behavior is complicated. At x=1.0 (P 100%) resistivity is very low and exhibits a metallic T dependence. Superconductivity is observed around 5 K. When P concentration is reduced, resistivity slightly increases and T_{\rm c} increases up to \sim12 K at x=0.8. With further decreasing P content, superconductivity disappears and \rho(T) shows a kink at around 20 K. We consider that this kink feature corresponds to the AFM phase transition accompanied with the structural phase transition [26]. At lower P contents, the kink of \rho(T) disappears and

Almost all the diffraction peaks are indexed assuming the tetragonal structure with the P4/nmm symmetry. The peaks indicated by triangles are due to impurities.

  the superconductivity manifests itself again, for example, at 12 K at x=0.4. However, this superconducting composition region is very narrow and the other AFM phase appears below x=0.3. The superconductivity for x=0.4, 0.8, and x=1.0 was also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility.

Figure 3(c) illustrates the phase diagram of La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, T_{\rm c} and Neel temperature T_{N} being plotted as a function of x. We can clearly see two superconducting phases (SC1 and SC2) and two AFM phases (AFM1 and AFM2). This is very similar to the phase diagram of LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O [17, 27, 28] that is indicated in the same figure by open symbols and dashed curves. Although in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O the AFM state between x=0.4 and 0.7 was observed only by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) but not clearly seen in \rho(T)[17], it is visible in \rho(T) for the case of La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O. Therefore, we can safely conclude that there exists the second AFM phase (AFM2) between the two superconducting phases in the parent and hole doped compounds. The effect of hole doping is the expansion of the first AFM phase (AFM1) near x=0 and the shift of the first superconducting phase (SC1) to the higher x region.

In this work, the synchrotron x-ray diffraction could not be performed at low temperatures for La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O because the samples are easily decomposed. To confirm the structural phase transition together with the phase transition to AFM2 state in La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, a further diffraction study is required.

Next, the results for the electron doped system, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, are presented in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a)

The blue and green circles indicate T_{\rm c} determined by zero resistivity and by the onset of resistive transition, respectively. T_{\rm c} and T_{N} of LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O in previous reports are also plotted in panel (c) by large open symbols [17] and small ones [27, 28]. Solid and broken lines are the guide for the eyes.

  shows the T dependence of resistivity for various x values. Roughly speaking, resistivity does not change with x so much. All the samples show a metallic T dependence of resistivity with a superconducting transition. Bulk superconductivity was also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The resistivity is the lowest at x=1.0, which is commonly observed in all the studied As/P substitution systems. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and the inset, the T dependence becomes almost linear, \rho(T)\simT, and T_{\rm c} shows a maximum value at x=0.4-0.5. At the lower and the higher P contents, T dependence approaches the Fermi liquid behavior \rho\sim T^{2}. The T_{\rm c} is plotted as a function of x in Fig. 4(c). In spite of the linear change of all the structure parameters [Figs. 2(b) and 2(e)], T_{\rm c} changes nonmonotonically with x, peaking at x=0.4-0.5.

Finally the results of heavily electron doped systems, LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.75}H_{0.25} and LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}, are examined. By using hydrogen, we could achieve the heavy electron doping in the 1111 system. The T dependences of resistivity for all the P compositions are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 6(a). As is clearly seen, all the samples show metallic \rho(T) with very small resistivity values. For example, the residual resistivity is less than 250 \mu\Omega cm for all the compositions although the samples are polycrystals. As shown in Figs. 5(a), 5(b) 6(a), and 6(b), the superconductivity appears only around x=0 in these systems. The maximum T_{\rm c} (\sim35 K) is observed at x=0 (As 100%) for y=0.30. This value is higher than those for lower doping levels (y). The T_{\rm c} value for y=0.25 is much lower than the case of y=0.30.

When x is slightly increased, T_{\rm c} is rapidly suppressed and eventually disappears above x=0.2. The T_{\rm c} values of both H-doped systems are plotted as a function of x in Figs. 5(c) and 6(c). It should be noted that the nonsuperconducting samples with x>0.2 are not insulators but very good metals,

  exhibiting T^{2} resistivity. This suggests that there is no AFM phase in this compositional region.

## IV Discussion

All the data of T_{\text{c}} and T_{N} are summarized in Fig. 7(a), together with the results for F contents of y=0, 0.05, and 0.10 in our previous works [16, 17]. Here we can identify three superconducting regions. The first one (SC1) is near the AFM1 phase, while the second one (SC2) is close to the AFM2 phase. The last one (SC3) is located at very high H-doping compositions.

According to the band calculation [2], the Fermi surfaces of LaFeAsO are expected as illustrated in Fig. 7(b). Here the nesting between hole and electron FSs is crucial for spin fluctuation. Since the sizes of hole and electron FSs are comparable, the nesting condition is relatively good, which causes AFM order in AFM1. When holes are doped into the parent compound LaAsFeO, the hole FSs near the T point slightly expand while the electron FS near (\pm\pi, 0) or (0, \pm\pi) shrinks. This makes the nesting condition better, resulting in the stability of AFM1 phase. This could be the reason for the expansion of AFM1 phase with Sr substitution.

For LaFePO, the band calculation predicts that the d_{xy} FS near (\pi,\pi) is missing [2, 29]. [See Fig. 7(c).] Therefore, the nesting between d_{yz} and d_{xz} FS is important for spin fluctuation. The AFM2 phase is considered to be in a strong limit of this fluctuation. When electrons are doped, this spin correlation is weakened and the AFM2 phase vanishes. Instead, the SC2 phase emerges. Therefore, it is likely that the superconductivity in the SC2 phase is mediated by the two-dimensional spin fluctuation via the d_{yz}/d_{xz} FS nesting.

The strength of spin fluctuation can be monitored by the power (n) of T in resistivity \rho(T)= \rho_{0}+AT^{n}. The x dependence of n is summarized in Fig. 8. The fitting of \rho(T) was performed between 100 K and the onset temperature of resistive transition. The fitting parameters of \rho(T) for x=0.40, 0.50 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, and x=0 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}, where \rho(T)\simT as presented in Figs. 4(a) and 6(a), are shown as examples in the Appendix. In the electron doped systems with y=0.05, 0.10, and 0.14, n decreases from 2 (at x=1.0) to 1 with decreasing x. At the x composition where n\sim 1, T_{\text{c}} reaches a maximum value. This can be understood as follows. At x=1.0, spin fluctuation is weak and the system is close to the Fermi liquid. As x decreases, spin fluctuation strength increases and the system turns to a non-Fermi liquid state near the quantum critical point, where the T-linear resistivity and the T_{\text{c}} maximum are observed.

The T-linear resistivity is caused by some bosonic fluctuation but not necessarily by spin fluctuation. However, in the case of SC2, the corresponding AFM spin fluctuation was clearly observed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Figures 9(a)-9(d) are contour plots of the AFM fluctuation component of 1I/T_{1}T for various compositions, where T_{1} is a nuclear spin relaxation time estimated from

Figure 7: (a) The schematic phase diagram of (La,Sr)FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}(O,F/H). Three blue areas indicate the antiferromagnetic phases (AFM1, AFM2, and AFM3). The contour lines of T_{\text{c}} are drawn by extrapolation on the basis of the data shown in Figs. 3(c), 4(c) 5(c), 6(c) and previous results [16, 17]. The dots indicate the position of materials that were actually synthesized.

The solid red and broken blue lines indicate the hole and electron Fermi surfaces, respectively.

  the ^{31}P-NMR experiment. Here we assume that (1/T_{1}T) is decomposed as (1/T_{1}T)=(1/T_{1}T)_{AFM}+(1/T_{1}T)_{0}[30]. The first term represents the strength of AFM fluctuation due to FS nesting, while the second one is q independent and proportional to the square of density of states at E_{F}. The second term was estimated by assuming that its T dependence is the same as that of K_{s}^{2}. Here, K_{s} is the spin part of Knight shift, which is proportional to the density of states at E_{F}. Figure 9 clearly demonstrates that the composition (x) region of the strong AFM fluctuation corresponds to the x region of high T_{\rm c} for y = 0.05, 0.10, and 0.14. It means that when the AFM fluctuation is enhanced, the T_{\rm c} is raised in the SC2 phase.

What is remarkable here is that even if the system approaches the quantum critical point with increasing As concentration it does not go into an AFM ordered phase but into another superconducting phase (SC1). As discussed in our previous paper, this is linked to the band crossover with As substitution, namely, the sinking down of d_{z}: band below E_{F} and the rising up of the d_{xy} band above E_{F}[16, 17].

Next, we discuss the SC3 phase. In the heavily electron doped state, the hole FS must be radically shrunk, while the electron FS is expanded [31]. [See Fig. 7(d).] The imbalance of FS sizes makes the nesting condition worse. In this circumstance, it is inappropriate to take the nesting scenario under the assumption of moderately electron correlation. Actually, the NMR measurement confirms that the low energy spin fluctuation is very weak in LaFeAs_{0.6}P_{0.4}O_{0.7}H_{0.3}. As shown in Fig. 9(e), the increase in the 1/T_{1}T due to AFM spin fluctuations, evaluated as |(1/T_{1}T)_{\rm AFM}|\sim 0.002, is significantly smaller than |(1/T_{1}T)_{\rm AFM}|\sim 0.07 at (x,y)= (0.40,0.10) that corresponds to the highest T_{\rm c} composition in SC2 phase. Note that the T-linear resistivity with high T_{\rm c} is observed at x = 0 for y = 0.30 [Fig. 8(e)], while the lower-T_{\rm c} samples for y = 0.25 and the nonsuperconducting ones for y = 0.25 and 0.30 show T^{2} or larger power law behavior of \rho(T). It means that a strong bosonic fluctuation governs the physical properties in the SC3 phase.

One of the candidates for this bosonic fluctuation is the spin fluctuation due to the next nearest neighbor hopping of d_{xy} orbital electrons [29, 31]. This is based on a strong electron correlation regime in real space, in contrast to the FS nesting picture in k space. According to this scenario, the rapid suppression of T_{\rm c} with increasing x can be explained by the disappearance of d_{xy} FS near (\pi,\pi), because this orbital mainly contributes to the spin fluctuation via the next nearest neighbor hopping. Since the system rapidly changes to the

The solid lines are the guide for the eyes.

  Fermi liquid with increasing x, electron correlation strongly depends on the orbitals forming FSs. Another possibility is superconductivity mediated by other bosonic fluctuation such as orbital fluctuation. The contribution of orbital degree of freedom has been widely discussed in the iron-based superconductors [9]. The electronic nematicity could be a smoking gun of orbital fluctuation [10, 11, 12].

Finally, we return to the discussion of SC1 phase. In this phase, it has been found that the spin fluctuation monitored by 1/_T_1T of NMR is not strongly enhanced at low temperatures [32]. The T dependence of resistivity also suggests a weaker bosonic fluctuation [16, 17]. The expected FSs are illustrated in Fig. 7(b). Here the nesting condition is moderate, as pointed out in Refs. [29, 31]. Usui and coworkers proposed that the spin fluctuation due to FS nesting (low energy limit) does not play a major role but the spin fluctuation due to finite energy hopping contributes to superconductivity. Actually the 1/_T_1T of NMR indicated that AFM spin fluctuation starts to develop at higher temperature in SC1 than in SC2, which may indicate the contribution of spin fluctuation with higher energy scale [30]. Because of the multiple-orbital character, various kinds of spin fluctuations with various energy scales are possibly involved in the superconductivity. Another possibility is the contribution of other bosonic fluctuation. To specify the pairing mechanism in this phase, further study is required.

## V Conclusion

We have systematically studied the As/P substitution effects on the electronic state of LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O for various carrier doping levels (y). In the hole-doped La_{0.9}Sr_{0.1}FeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O, the temperature-dependent resistivity indicates that there exist two AFM phases (AFM1 and AFM2) and two superconducting phases (SC1 and SC2) as in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O. In electron-doped LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O with the doping level of y=0.14, SC1 state is destabilized by heavy electron doping, while SC2 survives around x=0.40-0.50. In further electron-doped LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{1-x}H_{y} with y=0.30, another superconducting phase (SC3) appears at x\sim 0. In these regions of (x,y)=(0.40-0.50,0.14) and (0,\,0.30), resistivity shows non-Fermi-liquid behaviors, indicating the existence of strong bosonic fluctuation.

The extensive study over a wide x-y composition range has revealed three distinct superconducting phases with different FS topologies. One of them (SC2) can be well understood as the superconductivity mediated by AFM spin fluctuation via the nesting of d_{yz}d_{zx} FSs, because T_{\rm c} is clearly correlated with the spin fluctuation strength monitored by 1/_T_1T in NMR and the power n in \rho\sim T^{n}. The superconducting phase (SC3) in the heavily electron doped region should be considered in a strong correlation regime where the FS nesting scenario does not work. In this phase, a particular orbital (d_{xy}) seems to play a crucial role in superconductivity. In the last superconducting phase (SC1), the nesting condition is moderate and the bosonic fluctuation monitored by \rho(T) and 1/_T_1T is also moderate. Contribution of spin fluctuation with various energy scales is one of the possible candidates for pairing glue in SC1, although the possibility of other bosonic fluctuation cannot be excluded.

Here we provide the fitting parameters of temperature(T) dependent resistivity \rho(T) for the optimal T_{\rm c} samples (x=0.40, 0.50 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14}, and x=0 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}) to supplement the main text. As shown in Figs. 4(a) and 6(a), the \rho(T) can be expressed as \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n} at low temperatures, where \rho_{0} is residual resistivity, n the power of T, and A the coefficient. The fitting of \rho(T) was performed between 100 K and the onset T of resistive transition. Table 1 shows the fitting results of \rho_{0}, A, and n for x=0.40, 0.50 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.86}F_{0.14} and x=0 in LaFeAs_{1-x}P_{x}O_{0.70}H_{0.30}.
