###### Abstract

After the discovery of nematic topological superconductivity in
Cu,Bi2Se3, carrier-doped topological insulators are established as a
fertile ground for topological superconductors. The superconductor
Cu1.5(PbSe)5(Bi2Se3)6 (CPSBS) contains Bi2Se3 blocks as a constitutional
unit, but its superconducting gap appears to have nodes [S. Sasaki _et
al._, Phys. Rev. B **90**, 220504 (2014)], which is in contrast to the
fully opened gap in Cu3Bi2Se3 and the relation between the two
superconductors remained an open question. Here, we report our
observation of clear twofold symmetry in the in-plane magnetic field
direction dependencies of the upper critical field and of the specific
heat of CPSBS, where the direction of the maxima, which is different
from that in Cu3Bi2Se3, indicates that the gap nodes are located in the
mirror plane of the crystal lattice. This means that the topological
nematic state with mirror-symmetry-protected nodes is realized in CPSBS.

The search for concrete materials to realize novel topological states of
matter is an exciting frontier in condensed matter physics [1, 2, 3]. In
that search, topological superconductors attract particular attention
due to the potential appearance of exotic quasiparticles called Majorana
fermions at their boundaries [2, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The superconductors
derived from topological insulators (TIs) are expected to be a fertile
ground in this respect, owing to the strong spin-orbit coupling which
may give rise to an unconventional momentum-dependent superconducting
gap even for the isotropic pairing force coming from conventional
electron-phonon interactions [8, 9].

The first of such materials was Cu3Bi2Se3[10], which is synthesized by
intercalating Cu into the van der Waals gap of the prototypical TI
material Bi2Se3. Cu3Bi2Se3 shows superconductivity with T_(c) ≃ 3 K for
x ≃ 0.3, and early point-contact spectroscopy measurements pointed to
the occurrence of topological superconductivity associated with surface
Majorana fermions [11]. Recent measurements of its bulk superconducting
properties have elucidated [12, 13] that it realizes a topological
superconducting state which spontaneously breaks in-plane rotational
symmetry in a twofold-symmetric manner, even though the crystal lattice
symmetry is threefold. Such an unconventional state is consistent with
one of the four possible superconducting states constrained by the
D_(3d) lattice symmetry of Bi2Se3[8, 9]; this state, named the Δ_(4x) or
Δ_(4y) state depending on the direction of nodes or gap minima, is
characterized by a nematic order parameter and hence is called a
_nematic superconducting state_[14]. It was reported that Sr2Bi2Se3[15]
and Nb3Bi2Se3[16] also realize the nematic superconducting state [17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

An interesting superconducting compound related to Cu2Bi2Se3 is
Cu4(PbSe)5(Bi2Se3)6 (CPSBS), which was discovered in 2014 [24]. Its
parent compound (PbSe)5(Bi2Se3)6 (PSBS) can be viewed as a natural
heterostructure formed by a stack of two-quintuple-layer (QL) Bi2Se3
units alternating with one-bilayer PbSe units [25, 26, 27, 28, 29].
Since the binary compound PbSe is a topologically trivial insulator,
PSBS consists of ultrathin TI layers separated by trivial-insulator
layers. When Cu is intercalated into the van der Waals gap in the Bi2Se3
unit of PSBS, superconductivity with T_(c) = 2.8 K shows up and a nearly
100

In this Rapid Communication, we report our discovery of twofold symmetry
in the upper critical field H_(c2) and the specific heat c_(p) in their
dependencies on the magnetic field direction in the basal plane. The
pattern of the twofold symmetry indicates that the gap nodes are lying
in the mirror plane of the crystal, suggesting that the Δ_(4x) state
with symmetry-protected nodes is realized in CPSBS. This is in contrast
to the Δ_(4y) state realized in Cu2Bi2Se3, in which the nodes are not
protected by symmetry and thus are lifted to form gap minima. We discuss
that the likely cause of the Δ_(4x) state is the weak distortion of the
Bi2Se3 lattice imposed by the PbSe units. This establishes CPSBS as a
nematic topological superconductor with symmetry-protected nodes.

High-quality PSBS single crystals were grown by using a modified
Bridgman method following Refs. [24, 27]. X-ray Laue images were used
for identifying the crystallographic a axis upon cutting the pristine
crystals, which were then electrochemically treated to intercalate Cu
following the recipe of Kriener _et al._[31], and the superconductivity
was activated by annealing. The precise x value determined by the weight
change [31] was 1.47 for the two samples presented here. The
superconducting shielding fraction (SF) of the samples was measured in a
commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometer. Further experimental details are given in the Supplemental
Material [32].

To elucidate the possible in-plane anisotropy of the superconducting
state, we employed the measurements of both the out-of-plane resistance
R_(⊥) and the specific heat c_(p) in various orientations of the
in-plane magnetic field H [see Fig. 1(a) for configurations]. From the
R_(⊥)(H) data, the upper critical field H_(c2) was extracted by
registering the field where 50

The temperature dependence of R_(⊥) presents a weak upturn below ∼100 K
[Fig. 1(c)], which reflects the quasi-two-dimensional (2D) electronic
states of CPSBS. The R_(⊥)(H) curves measured at 0.5 K with the applied
magnetic field in the three orthogonal directions, a, b, and c^(*) axes,
are shown in Fig. 2(a). One can immediately see that H_(c2) for the
three magnetic field directions are different; the smallest value for
H ∥ c^(*) is a consequence of the quasi-2D nature and was already
reported [24], but here we observe that there is also an additional
in-plane anisotropy between H ∥ a and H ∥ b. The precise in-plane
magnetic field direction dependence of H_(c2) at 0.5 K is shown in the
main panel of Fig. 2(b), where one can see clear twofold symmetry with
maxima at H ∥ a and the variation ΔH_(c2)^(∥) of ∼0.25 T. As explained
in detail in the Supplemental Material [32], the a axis in CPSBS is
parallel to the mirror plane and hence the direction of H_(c2) maxima is
90^(∘) rotated from that in Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃[13]. We note that anisotropic
H_(c2) measurements with the current along the b axis were also
performed, and H_(c2) was not affected by the current direction [32].
Also, the H_(c2) anisotropy in R_(⊥)(H) was reproduced in one more
sample [32].

For comparison, the magnetic field direction dependence of H_(c2) at 0.5
K in the ac^(*) plane is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b), where the
magnitude of the variation in H_(c2), ΔH_(c2)^(⊥), is about 1.0 T. This
ΔH_(c2)^(⊥) value means that, for the observed twofold in-plane
anisotropy with ΔH_(c2)^(∥) ∼ 0.25 T to be ascribed to an accidental
c^(*)-axis component of H, a sample misalignment of ∼30^(∘) would be
necessary. This is obviously beyond the possible error in our
experimental setup, and one can conclude that the twofold in-plane
anisotropy is intrinsic.

Due to the volume sensitivity, the c_(p)(T) data provide a better
estimate of the superconducting volume fraction (VF) than the
diamagnetic SF. After subtracting the phononic contribution [32], the
electronic specific heat c_(el) shows a clear anomaly associated with
the superconducting transition; Fig. 1(e) shows a plot of c_(el)/T vs T,
which is fitted with a line-nodal gap theory [33] used for CPSBS in Ref.
[24]. This fitting yields the superconducting VF of 85

The magnetic field dependencies of c_(el) at various temperatures for
both H ∥ a and H ∥ b are shown in Fig. 3; the data presented here are
after subtracting the Schottky anomaly [32] by using the same g-factor
as that reported in Ref. [24]. One can see that at 2.01 and 1.01 K,
c_(el) changes little above a

certain H value, which we identify as H_(c2). However, at lower
temperature (≲0.5 K) the change in the $c_{\rm el}(H)/T$ behavior across
H_(c2) becomes less evident and we lose the sensitivity to determine
H_(c2). As a result, the in-plane anisotropy in H_(c2) is best visible
in $c_{\rm el}$ at intermediate temperatures around 1 K [Figs. 4(a) and
4(b)]. In our analysis of $c_{\rm el}(H)$, H_(c2) was determined as the
crossing point of the two linear fittings of the $c_{\rm el}/T$ vs H
data below and above H_(c2) as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b); here, one
can see that the difference in H_(c2) for H ∥ a and H ∥ b is better
discernible at 1.01 K with ΔH_(c2) ∼ 0.34 T than at 0.76 K. Importantly,
H_(c2) is larger for H ∥ a, which is consistent with the result of the
R_(⊥)(H) measurements.

The temperature dependencies of H_(c2) extracted from R_(⊥)(H) and
$c_{\rm el}(H)$ for the principal magnetic field orientations are
plotted in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), respectively. The absolute values of
H_(c2) in the two panels are different, mainly because Fig. 4(c) shows
the midpoint of the transition while Fig. 4(d) shows the complete
suppression. Nevertheless, the in-plane anisotropy is consistently found
in the R_(⊥)(H) and $c_{\rm el}(H)$ results. In Figs. 4(c) and 4(d), the
H_(c2)(T) data are fitted empirically with
H_(c2)(T) = H_(c2)(0)[1 − (T/T_(c))^(a)] with a ≈ 1.2; the
inapplicability of the conventional Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory
for H_(c2)(T) was already reported for CPSBS and was discussed to be a
possible consequence of unconventional pairing [24].

To supplement the conclusion from H_(c2), we have also measured the
detailed magnetic field direction dependence of $c_{\rm el}$ at 0.76 and
1.01 K in various strengths of the in-plane magnetic field from 2.4 to
6.0 T [Figs. 5(a) and 5(b)]. One can clearly see twofold-symmetric
variations where the maxima occur at H ∥ a for H < H_(c2), but the
anisotropy quickly disappears for H > H_(c2) [see also Fig. 5(c)]. This
disappearance of the anisotropy in the normal state strongly supports
the interpretation that the anisotropy is due to the nematicity which
arises spontaneously in the superconducting state. It also demonstrates
that the observed c_(p) anisotropy cannot be due to some g-factor
anisotropy which might show up through the Schottky anomaly.

It is useful to note that in Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃, a sign change in the magnetic
field direction dependence of $c_{\rm el}$ was observed [13]; namely,
the maxima in $c_{\rm el}$ were observed for H normal to a mirror plane
at high T and/or high H, but at low T and low H, $c_{\rm el}$ presented
minima in this direction. Such a switching behavior was explained as a
result of the competition between the Doppler-shift effect and the
vortex-scattering effect discussed by Vorontsov and Vekhter (VV) [34].
According to VV, the latter effect is dominant at higher H at any
temperature in a nodal superconductor and causes the maxima in
$c_{\rm el}$ to appear for H in the nodal direction.

In view of the VV theory, the twofold in-plane anisotropy in CPSBS with
maxima in $c_{\rm el}$ appearing for H ∥ a near H_(c2) points to the
realization of the Δ_(4x)-type superconducting gap, which has gap nodes
in the mirror plane [see Fig. 5(d)]. This conclusion is different from
that for Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃[13], where the Δ_(4y) state is realized. Note that
the direction of maxima in H_(c2)(φ)[35] is also consistent with the
Δ_(4x) gap in CPSBS and with the Δ_(4y) gap in Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃. While the
Δ_(4x) state was originally predicted for the three-dimensional
ellipsoidal Fermi surface of Bi₂Se₃ to have point nodes [8], the
quasi-2D nature of the Fermi surface in CPSBS [28] extends the original

[24].

point nodes into line nodes along the c^(*) direction, at least in the
extreme 2D limit [36]. As pointed out by Fu [14], the nodes in the
Δ_(4x) state are protected by mirror symmetry, which explains why CPSBS
is a nodal superconductor despite its essential similarity to
Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃.

It is useful to mention that the crystallographic symmetry of CPSBS
belongs to the monoclinic space group C2/m[26, 27, 29], which means that
the lattice is actually twofold symmetric [37]. The monoclinic nature
arises from the fact that PSBS is a heterostructure of two dissimilar
crystal symmetries, the trigonal lattice of Bi₂Se₃ and the square
lattice of PbSe (see Ref. [32] for details). The lowering of the
symmetry makes one of the three equivalent mirror planes in Bi₂Se₃ to be
the only mirror plane, which contains the monoclinic a axis; in fact,
there is a weak but finite uniaxial distortion [32] in the Bi₂Se₃ QL
units in PSBS [26, 27]. According to the theory [14, 35], under the
constraint of the D_(3d) point group, an odd-parity superconducting
state which breaks in-plane rotation symmetry must obey E_(u) symmetry
and in general has a nematic gap function Δ(k) = η₁Δ_(4x) + η₂Δ_(4y),
where the two nodal gap functions Δ_(4x) and Δ_(4y) are degenerate and
η⃗ = (η₁, η₂) can be viewed as the nematic director. This is why the
E_(u) state is called nematic. However, for the physical properties to
present a twofold anisotropy, a uniaxial symmetry-breaking perturbation
is necessary [35]. In CPSBS, the weak uniaxial lattice distortion, which
leads to the C2/m symmetry, is apparently responsible for lifting the
degeneracy between Δ_(4x) and Δ_(4y) and makes the nematic director take
the definite direction η⃗ = (1, 0). Such a situation is rather similar to
that realized in the high-T_(c) cuprate YBa₂Cu₃O_(y), in which a tiny
orthorhombic distortion dictates the orientation of the spontaneously
formed nematic state [38], although the nematicity is about the normal
state in YBa₂Cu₃O_(y) while it is about the superconducting state in
CPSBS.

We note that the ARPES measurements on superconducting CPSBS found no
clear evidence for twofold-symmetric Fermi-surface distortion within the
experimental error of ∼2

In summary, we found that both the H_(c2) and the c_(p) of
superconducting CPSBS present twofold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy with
maxima occurring for H ∥ a. This points to the realization of the
Δ_(4x)-type superconducting gap associated with symmetry-protected line
nodes extending along the c^(*) direction. Hence, CPSBS is a nematic
topological superconductor differing from Cu_(x)Bi₂Se₃ in the
orientation of the nematic director.
