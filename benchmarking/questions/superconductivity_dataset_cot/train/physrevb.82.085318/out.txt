29 May  be incorporated above 1\!\times\!10^{22} cm^{-3} in the present doping technology. Some theoretical studies predict the higher T_{C} with increasing the doping concentration. The superconducting properties in (110) films are also evaluated. It is difficult to incorporate boron atoms into (110) films. The maximum doping level in (110) films is 4\!\times\!10^{21} cm^{-3} which is twice lower than those in (111) and (001) films. Superconductivity is not observed for n_{\rm B}\!<\!9\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} for (110) films. The critical boron concentration of SI transition in (110) films is 9\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} which is very different from those in (111) and (001) films.

On the other hand, the relationship between T_{C} and the carrier concentration n_{H} (=1/eR_{H}) measured by Hall effect measurement on the basis of the simple assumption exhibits a different behavior, as shown in Fig. 2. T_{C} as a function of carrier concentration n_{H} is almost the same around SI transition, independent of the growth orientation. The critical carrier concentration of SI transition is 4\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3}. The carrier concentration in (110) films is generally lower than boron concentration. The critical boron concentration of 9 \times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} in (110) films is much higher than the critical carrier concentration of 4\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3}. In contrast, the critical boron concentration of 3\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} in (111) and (001) films is lower than the critical carrier concentration.

Figure 3 shows the relationship between the carrier and boron concentrations. The Hall carrier concentration exceeds the actual doping concentration for n_{\rm B}\!\approx\!3\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} in (111) and (001) films except one (001) sample. Only in the superconducting sample, anomaly high carrier concentration is observed. Hall carrier concentration n_{H} deviates from the actual doping concentration n_{\rm B} by the Hall scattering factor r_{H} according to

\[n_{\rm B}=r_{H}\cdot n_{H}=\frac{r_{H}}{eR_{H}}.\] (1)

r_{H} is calculated by the ratio between n_{  scattering factor is determined as r_{H}=\langle\tau^{2}\rangle/\langle\tau\rangle^{2}, where \tau is the relaxation time of the carrier.[10] Then, r_{H} is related to the scattering mechanism and the band structure. For nondegenerate and spherically symmetric band structure, r_{H}>1 is given. As it is well known, r_{H}=3\,\pi/8=1.18 for phonon scattering and r_{H}=315\,\pi/512=1.93 for ionized impurity scattering in the case of the nondegenerate single band. However, Allgaier[11] indicated that anisotropy of the Fermi surface decreases r_{H} and induces r_{H}< 1. Carrier concentration exceeds actual doping concentration due to the distorted Fermi surface. The top of the valence band in diamond (including other diamond structure such as silicon and germanium) at the \Gamma point is triply degenerate. When the Fermi level (E_{F}) enters into the valence band and the bands move away from \Gamma point, the three bands split and become anisotropic, as calculated by Cardona[12] and Boeri _et al.[13]_ A schematic of the Fermi surface in the (111) plane of \bm{k} space is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The Fermi surface extends along the \{110\} directions in heavily boron-doped diamond. This distorted Fermi surface in the valence band causes r_{H}<1, as is also indicated in silicon[14, 15] and germanium.[16] Yokoya[17] evaluated the band structure with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in our (111) boron-doped CVD diamond samples. For n_{\rm B}=3\,\times\,10^{20} cm^{-3}, the E_{F} lies around the top of the valence band. In the heavily doped region, the E_{F} enters the valence band. The boron concentration has an important effect on the position of E_{F} from the valence-band maximum and superconducting properties. Unlike in silicon and germanium, the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in diamond is not related to the Mott's conventional MIT. When the E_{F} enters into the valence band, the system becomes metallic. The boron concentration of SI transition corresponds to that of MIT. Intermediate concentration region (metal, but not superconductivity) does not exist. In insulating region, the hopping conductivity is observed as also reported by Klein _et al.[18]_

It is generally observed in superconductor metals that Hall carrier concentration exceeds atomic concentration.[19, 20] In some cases, Hall carrier concentration of superconductor metals is several times larger than that of nonsuperconductor metals. The reason for this is that the Fermi surface is not simply spherical. The Fermi surface of superconductor metals is distorted compared with that of nonsuperconductor metals. The distorted Fermi surface results in large Hall concentration and superconducting transition. It is worth noting that the Hall mobility \mu_{H} of boron-doped diamond with n_{\rm B}\geq3\,\times\,10^{20} cm^{-3} is 1-10 cm^{2}/V s and close to those of typical superconductor metals. For example, \mu_{H} of Pb is 8.4.[20]

## IV IV. Lattice expansion

The critical boron concentration of SI transition is different among three growth orientation as shown in Fig. 1. On the other hand, the critical carrier concentration of SI transition is same independent of the growth orientation as shown in Fig. 2. This fact leads us to understand that the doping site is related to superconductivity in diamond. The perpendicular lattice expansion measured by XRD as a function of boron concentration is shown in Fig. 4. Vegard's law is the model representing the lattice mismatch when the dopant occupies the substitutional site.[21] Vegard's law in boron-doped diamond is expressed as

\[\frac{\Delta a}{a_{s}}=\frac{r_{\rm B}-r_{C}}{r_{C}}\frac{n_{\rm B}}{n_{C}}= 8.12\,\times\,10^{-25}\cdot n_{\rm B},\] (2)

where \Delta a/a_{s} is the lattice expansion ratio. a_{s} is the lattice constant of the substrate and 3.5671 A in diamond. r_{\rm B} and r_{C} are covalent bonding radii of boron and carbon atoms, namely, 0.088 nm and 0.077 nm, respectively. n_{C} is the concentration of carbon atoms. The perpendicular lattice expansions in (111) and (001) films fit Vegard's law. It is deduced that almost all the boron atoms occupy the substitutional site in (111) and (001) films and fully activated. An additional contribution of the deformation potential should be considered. The free carrier concentration shifts the energies of the valence- and conduction-band maximums. The change in the total energy of the semiconductor shifts the lattice parameter. Bardeen and Shockley[22] proposed and Yokota[23] introduced an additional term to the Vegard's law in p-type semiconductors. It can be deduced from the results in (111) and (001) films that the contribution of the deformation potential is small compared with that of the introduction of substitutional boron. Thus, the amount of substitutional boron atoms mainly determines the lattice expansion.

On the other hand, the lattice expansion ratios in (110) films are far lower than the theoretical values. As the interstitial dopant atoms increase, the lattice mismatch deviates downward from Vegard's law. Therefore, it is predicted that (110) films have a high interstitial boron concentration. Around the critical boron concentration of 9\,\times\,10^{20} cm^{-3} in (110) films, only the boron concentration of 3\,\times\,10^{20} cm^{-3} may occupy substitutional site and contribute carriers related to the superconducting transition. The first work for the SI

Figure 4: (Color online) Perpendicular lattice expansion as a function of boron concentration: triangle plots are for (111) boron-doped diamond films, square plots for (001) films, and diamond-shaped plots for (110) films. Open square plots are reported by Bustarret _et al._ Dashed line shows the Vegardâ€™s law using the covalent bonding radii r_{\rm B} and r_{C} of 0.088 nm and 0.077 nm, respectively. Dotted line is drawn so as to fit the data in plots of (110) films.

  transition by Bustarret _et al._[3] and Klein _et al._[18] can also be explained from the amount of interstitial boron atoms. The critical boron concentration of their (001) CVD samples fabricated using a H_{2}/CH_{4}/B_{2}H_{6} gas mixture was 5 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3}, which is higher than that of 3 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3} in our (111) and (001) films. The lattice expansions in their works are smaller than those in our (111) and (001) films as shown in Fig. 4.[24] It is indicated that the samples reported by Bustarret _et al._ and Klein _et al._ have a high concentration of interstitial boron atoms compared with our (111) and (001) films. Other possible contribution to the lattice expansion is B-B dimers. However, the B-B bond length is very large. The existence of B-B dimers induces upward deviations in the diamond lattice.[25] In the case of (110) films, B-B dimers do not contribute deviations from Vegard's law.

Figure 5(a) shows the dependence of T_{C} on the perpendicular lattice expansion ratio deduced by x-ray diffraction. The T_{C} dependence is the same except for the heavy concentration range. This indicates that only substitutional boron induces superconductivity. The lattice expansion ratios approach 0.25% as T_{C} approaches zero, which corresponds to the situation where the diamond lattice has a boron concentration of 3 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3}. The difference of T_{C} between (111) and (001) films in the heavy doping range is explained by the shape of lattice expansion. Figure 5(b) shows the dependence of T_{C} on the in-plane lattice expansion ratio. Insets are the shape of the lattice expansion of (111) and (001) samples. In (111) samples, in-plane lattice fit the substrate. The crystalline lattice is strained like a heteroepitaxial growth such as SiGe on Si. In-plane lattice expansion ratio is less than 0.08% of the measurement limit of RSM with XRD. On the other hand, a relaxed and isotropic layer exists in (001) samples. Note that the Vegard's law for the strained layer is different from Eq. (2) by 1 + _p_/1 - p, where p is Poisson's ratio.[26] However, Poisson's ratio of diamond is 0.08 which is much smaller than other materials. The calculated values of Vegard's law for the strained and relaxed and layer is different by a factor of 1.18. The number is less than the errors of the measurement. The lattice strain changes the Fermi-surface topology and then r_{H}.[27] In the heavily doped region of n_{\rm B} \sim 1 \times 10^{22} cm^{-3}, carrier concentration in (111) films is larger than that in (001) films. r_{H} is 0.3-0.5 in (111) films while r_{H} is 0.7-0.8 in (001) films. This difference may be attributed to the crystalline lattice strain.

## V V. Conclusion

The critical boron concentration of superconductor-to-insulator transition in (111) and (001) films is 3 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3}, which is different from that of 9 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3} in (110) films. On the other hand, the critical carrier concentration evaluated by Hall effect measurement is a common value (4 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3}) in the three orientations. Carrier concentration is also a valuable parameter in diamond superconductor. The high critical boron concentration in (110) films is due to the existence of interstitial boron atoms. A boron concentration of 3 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3} in substitutional site is required for inducing superconductivity in diamond. Carrier concentrations in (111) and (001) films exceed the actual doping concentration in superconducting region. One of the major reasons is caused by the distortion of the Fermi surface.

29 May  be incorporated above 1\!\times\!10^{22} cm^{-3} in the present doping technology. Some theoretical studies predict the higher T_{C} with increasing the doping concentration. The superconducting properties in (110) films are also evaluated. It is difficult to incorporate boron atoms into (110) films. The maximum doping level in (110) films is 4\!\times\!10^{21} cm^{-3} which is twice lower than those in (111) and (001) films. Superconductivity is not observed for n_{\rm B}\!<\!9\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} for (110) films. The critical boron concentration of SI transition in (110) films is 9\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} which is very different from those in (111) and (001) films.

On the other hand, the relationship between T_{C} and the carrier concentration n_{H} (=1/eR_{H}) measured by Hall effect measurement on the basis of the simple assumption exhibits a different behavior, as shown in Fig. 2. T_{C} as a function of carrier concentration n_{H} is almost the same around SI transition, independent of the growth orientation. The critical carrier concentration of SI transition is 4\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3}. The carrier concentration in (110) films is generally lower than boron concentration. The critical boron concentration of 9 \times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} in (110) films is much higher than the critical carrier concentration of 4\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3}. In contrast, the critical boron concentration of 3\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} in (111) and (001) films is lower than the critical carrier concentration.

Figure 3 shows the relationship between the carrier and boron concentrations. The Hall carrier concentration exceeds the actual doping concentration for n_{\rm B}\!\approx\!3\!\times\!10^{20} cm^{-3} in (111) and (001) films except one (001) sample. Only in the superconducting sample, anomaly high carrier concentration is observed. Hall carrier concentration n_{H} deviates from the actual doping concentration n_{\rm B} by the Hall scattering factor r_{H} according to

\[n_{\rm B}=r_{H}\cdot n_{H}=\frac{r_{H}}{eR_{H}}.\] (1)

r_{H} is calculated by the ratio between n_{  scattering factor is determined as r_{H}=\langle\tau^{2}\rangle/\langle\tau\rangle^{2}, where \tau is the relaxation time of the carrier.[10] Then, r_{H} is related to the scattering mechanism and the band structure. For nondegenerate and spherically symmetric band structure, r_{H}>1 is given. As it is well known, r_{H}=3\,\pi/8=1.18 for phonon scattering and r_{H}=315\,\pi/512=1.93 for ionized impurity scattering in the case of the nondegenerate single band. However, Allgaier[11] indicated that anisotropy of the Fermi surface decreases r_{H} and induces r_{H}< 1. Carrier concentration exceeds actual doping concentration due to the distorted Fermi surface. The top of the valence band in diamond (including other diamond structure such as silicon and germanium) at the \Gamma point is triply degenerate. When the Fermi level (E_{F}) enters into the valence band and the bands move away from \Gamma point, the three bands split and become anisotropic, as calculated by Cardona[12] and Boeri _et al.[13]_ A schematic of the Fermi surface in the (111) plane of \bm{k} space is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The Fermi surface extends along the \{110\} directions in heavily boron-doped diamond. This distorted Fermi surface in the valence band causes r_{H}<1, as is also indicated in silicon[14, 15] and germanium.[16] Yokoya[17] evaluated the band structure with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in our (111) boron-doped CVD diamond samples. For n_{\rm B}=3\,\times\,10^{20} cm^{-3}, the E_{F} lies around the top of the valence band. In the heavily doped region, the E_{F} enters the valence band. The boron concentration has an important effect on the position of E_{F} from the valence-band maximum and superconducting properties. Unlike in silicon and germanium, the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in diamond is not related to the Mott's conventional MIT. When the E_{F} enters into the valence band, the system becomes metallic. The boron concentration of SI transition corresponds to that of MIT. Intermediate concentration region (metal, but not superconductivity) does not exist. In insulating region, the hopping conductivity is observed as also reported by Klein _et al.[18]_

It is generally observed in superconductor metals that Hall carrier concentration exceeds atomic concentration.[19, 20] In some cases, Hall carrier concentration of superconductor metals is several times larger than that of nonsuperconductor metals. The reason for this is that the Fermi surface is not simply spherical. The Fermi surface of superconductor metals is distorted compared with that of nonsuperconductor metals. The distorted Fermi surface results in large Hall concentration and superconducting transition. It is worth noting that the Hall mobility \mu_{H} of boron-doped diamond with n_{\rm B}\geq3\,\times\,10^{20} cm^{-3} is 1-10 cm^{2}/V s and close to those of typical superconductor metals. For example, \mu_{H} of Pb is 8.4.[20]

## IV IV. Lattice expansion

The critical boron concentration of SI transition is different among three growth orientation as shown in Fig. 1. On the other hand, the critical carrier concentration of SI transition is same independent of the growth orientation as shown in Fig. 2. This fact leads us to understand that the doping site is related to superconductivity in diamond. The perpendicular lattice expansion measured by XRD as a function of boron concentration is shown in Fig. 4. Vegard's law is the model representing the lattice mismatch when the dopant occupies the substitutional site.[21] Vegard's law in boron-doped diamond is expressed as

\[\frac{\Delta a}{a_{s}}=\frac{r_{\rm B}-r_{C}}{r_{C}}\frac{n_{\rm B}}{n_{C}}= 8.12\,\times\,10^{-25}\cdot n_{\rm B},\] (2)

where \Delta a/a_{s} is the lattice expansion ratio. a_{s} is the lattice constant of the substrate and 3.5671 A in diamond. r_{\rm B} and r_{C} are covalent bonding radii of boron and carbon atoms, namely, 0.088 nm and 0.077 nm, respectively. n_{C} is the concentration of carbon atoms. The perpendicular lattice expansions in (111) and (001) films fit Vegard's law. It is deduced that almost all the boron atoms occupy the substitutional site in (111) and (001) films and fully activated. An additional contribution of the deformation potential should be considered. The free carrier concentration shifts the energies of the valence- and conduction-band maximums. The change in the total energy of the semiconductor shifts the lattice parameter. Bardeen and Shockley[22] proposed and Yokota[23] introduced an additional term to the Vegard's law in p-type semiconductors. It can be deduced from the results in (111) and (001) films that the contribution of the deformation potential is small compared with that of the introduction of substitutional boron. Thus, the amount of substitutional boron atoms mainly determines the lattice expansion.

On the other hand, the lattice expansion ratios in (110) films are far lower than the theoretical values. As the interstitial dopant atoms increase, the lattice mismatch deviates downward from Vegard's law. Therefore, it is predicted that (110) films have a high interstitial boron concentration. Around the critical boron concentration of 9\,\times\,10^{20} cm^{-3} in (110) films, only the boron concentration of 3\,\times\,10^{20} cm^{-3} may occupy substitutional site and contribute carriers related to the superconducting transition. The first work for the SI

Figure 4: (Color online) Perpendicular lattice expansion as a function of boron concentration: triangle plots are for (111) boron-doped diamond films, square plots for (001) films, and diamond-shaped plots for (110) films. Open square plots are reported by Bustarret _et al._ Dashed line shows the Vegardâ€™s law using the covalent bonding radii r_{\rm B} and r_{C} of 0.088 nm and 0.077 nm, respectively. Dotted line is drawn so as to fit the data in plots of (110) films.

  transition by Bustarret _et al._[3] and Klein _et al._[18] can also be explained from the amount of interstitial boron atoms. The critical boron concentration of their (001) CVD samples fabricated using a H_{2}/CH_{4}/B_{2}H_{6} gas mixture was 5 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3}, which is higher than that of 3 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3} in our (111) and (001) films. The lattice expansions in their works are smaller than those in our (111) and (001) films as shown in Fig. 4.[24] It is indicated that the samples reported by Bustarret _et al._ and Klein _et al._ have a high concentration of interstitial boron atoms compared with our (111) and (001) films. Other possible contribution to the lattice expansion is B-B dimers. However, the B-B bond length is very large. The existence of B-B dimers induces upward deviations in the diamond lattice.[25] In the case of (110) films, B-B dimers do not contribute deviations from Vegard's law.

Figure 5(a) shows the dependence of T_{C} on the perpendicular lattice expansion ratio deduced by x-ray diffraction. The T_{C} dependence is the same except for the heavy concentration range. This indicates that only substitutional boron induces superconductivity. The lattice expansion ratios approach 0.25% as T_{C} approaches zero, which corresponds to the situation where the diamond lattice has a boron concentration of 3 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3}. The difference of T_{C} between (111) and (001) films in the heavy doping range is explained by the shape of lattice expansion. Figure 5(b) shows the dependence of T_{C} on the in-plane lattice expansion ratio. Insets are the shape of the lattice expansion of (111) and (001) samples. In (111) samples, in-plane lattice fit the substrate. The crystalline lattice is strained like a heteroepitaxial growth such as SiGe on Si. In-plane lattice expansion ratio is less than 0.08% of the measurement limit of RSM with XRD. On the other hand, a relaxed and isotropic layer exists in (001) samples. Note that the Vegard's law for the strained layer is different from Eq. (2) by 1 + _p_/1 - p, where p is Poisson's ratio.[26] However, Poisson's ratio of diamond is 0.08 which is much smaller than other materials. The calculated values of Vegard's law for the strained and relaxed and layer is different by a factor of 1.18. The number is less than the errors of the measurement. The lattice strain changes the Fermi-surface topology and then r_{H}.[27] In the heavily doped region of n_{\rm B} \sim 1 \times 10^{22} cm^{-3}, carrier concentration in (111) films is larger than that in (001) films. r_{H} is 0.3-0.5 in (111) films while r_{H} is 0.7-0.8 in (001) films. This difference may be attributed to the crystalline lattice strain.

## V V. Conclusion

The critical boron concentration of superconductor-to-insulator transition in (111) and (001) films is 3 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3}, which is different from that of 9 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3} in (110) films. On the other hand, the critical carrier concentration evaluated by Hall effect measurement is a common value (4 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3}) in the three orientations. Carrier concentration is also a valuable parameter in diamond superconductor. The high critical boron concentration in (110) films is due to the existence of interstitial boron atoms. A boron concentration of 3 \times 10^{20} cm^{-3} in substitutional site is required for inducing superconductivity in diamond. Carrier concentrations in (111) and (001) films exceed the actual doping concentration in superconducting region. One of the major reasons is caused by the distortion of the Fermi surface.

Figure 5: (Color online) Dependence of T_{C} on (a) perpendicular and (b) in-plane lattice expansion ratio deduced by x-ray diffraction. Triangle plots are for (111) boron-doped diamond films, square plots for (001) films, and diamond-shaped plots for (110) films. Solid lines are drawn so as to fit the data in plots. Insets are the shape of the lattice expansion of (111) and (001) samples.
