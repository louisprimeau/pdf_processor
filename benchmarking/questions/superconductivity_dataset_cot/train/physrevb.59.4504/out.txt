###### Abstract

We observed a rare-earth ion-size effect on T_{c} in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (R=Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, Sm, and Nd) systems which is similar to that in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} systems in our previous reports. For fixed Pr and Ca concentration (fixed x and y), T_{c} is linearly dependent on rare-earth ion radius r_{K}^{3+}. For a fixed Pr concentration x, there exists a maximum of T_{c} (T_{c,\max}) in T_{c} vs Ca concentration y curves. T_{c,\max} shifts to higher Ca concentration region for samples with larger R ion radius. The enhancement of T_{c} (\Delta T_{c,\max} =T_{c,\max}-T_{c,y=0}; T_{c,y=0} is the transition temperature T_{c} without Ca doping) increases with increasing R ion radius. We proposed an empirical formula for T_{c} (r_{K}^{3+},x,y) to fit our experimental data: T_{c}(x,y)=T_{c,0}-A\beta^{2}(\alpha/x+y/\beta)^{2}-Bx. All fitting parameters in this formula, T_{c0}, B, \beta, \alpha/\beta, and A\beta^{2}, are rare-earth ion-size dependent. [S0163-1829(99)01506-4]

## 1 Introduction

The substitution of Y by trivalent rare-earth elements in orthorhombic YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (YBCO), yields a superconducting phase with T_{c} identical to YBCO,[1] except for Ce, Tb, Pm, and Pr. It shows that the magnetic moments of the lanthanide ions have a weak effect on the CuO_{2} sheets. The insensitivity of the superconducting properties to the substitution is presumably due to their layered structure and the nearly complete lack of interaction between rare-earth and CuO_{2} sheets.[2]

Although crystallographically identical to all the other rare-earth-based superconductors, PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (PrBCO) inhibits the superconducting and metallic behavior.[3, 4, 5] The Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system is particularly interesting since it is isostructural to YBCO, yet the superconductivity is strongly suppressed as a function of Pr concentration.

The suppression of T_{c} by Pr doping in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2} Cu_{3}O_{7-y} has been attributed to several possible mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the filling of holes (hole filling) in CuO_{2} sheets due to the substitution of Pr ions with its valence greater than +3 and, hence, implies the suppression of superconductivity and metallic behavior, arising from a reduced number of carriers (holes) in CuO_{2} sheets. Indeed, magnetic susceptibility,[4, 5, 6] Hall measurements,[5] thermoelectric power,[7] muon spin resonance,[8] neutron diffraction,[9] specific-heat measurement,[10] and x-ray-absorption spectroscopy[11] are consistent with a Pr valence substantially larger than 3+. Superconductivity observed in a Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} film[12] strongly supports this mechanism. Based on the spin-polaron model, Wood[13] obtained an agreement with experimental data for a Pr concentration dependence of T_{c} in the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system.

However, this idea was later questioned. X-ray-absorption near-edge spectroscopy,[14] valence-band resonant photoemission,[15] lattice constant[16] and Raman spectrum[17] indicate a Pr valence close to 3+. According to electron-energy-loss spectroscopy measurement,[18] the total number of holes on O sites was shown to be independent of Pr concentration x. It suggests that Pr ions are trivalent and localize, rather than fill, the mobile holes on CuO_{2} planes. The localization leads to the suppression of superconductivity and induces a metal-insulator transition. In fact, most experimental results supporting hole filling would also support hole localization. Recently, Kao, Yu, and Guan[19] measured the hole concentration p per unit cell by using iodometric titration technique for (Gd_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (x= 0.1- 0.9) and (R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (R= Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, and Nd) samples. The chemical hole concentration p was compared to the Hall number \mathbf{n}_{H} and T_{c} reported in literature. What is most surprising is that the total carrier concentration p is independent of Pr concentration and remains primarily constant even when the samples are not superconducting in higher Pr concentration region (x\geq 0.5) in (Gd_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}.[19] It should also be noted that the total carrier concentration p remains primarily constant even when T_{c} is changed by almost 100% with the changing of R ions in (R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}.[19] The authors proposed that the total hole concentration p measured by iodometric technique is not changed with Pr doping but the concentration of mobile holes \mathbf{n}_{H} measured by the Hall effect is changed with T_{c} and Pr doping. It strongly suggests that T_{c} suppression appears to be caused by hole localization rather than hole filling.

The second mechanism for T_{c} suppression involves the spin-flip effect of the pairing electrons (pair breaking), being explained on the basis of Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) theory,[20] which has been used widely and successfully for interpretation of conventional alloy superconductors with paramagnetic doping. This model suggests Pr ion acts as a strong magnetic pair breaker.[21, 22, 6, 23] AG theory predicts that a reduced transition temperature T_{c}/T_{c0} will be a universal function of the reduced concentration x/x_{\rm cr},

\[\ln\{T_{c}/T_{c0}\}=\Psi(1/2)-\Psi(1/2+0.14xT_{c0}/x_{\rm cr}T_{c}),\] (1)

where T_{c0} is the T_{c} for ''pure'' material (without doping), x_{\rm cr} is the critical concentration for complete suppression of superconductivity and Ps is a digamma function. For _x__m_0, it gives an asymptotic form,

\[T_{c} = T_{c0} - \left[ {\left( {\pi /4k_{B}} \right)N\left( {E_{F}} \right)\tau^{2}\left( {g - 1} \right)^{2}J\left( {J + 1} \right)} \right]x,\]

where _N_(E_{F}) is the density of state at Fermi level and g and J, respectively, the Lande g factor and the total angular momentum of Hund's rules ground state of the Pr ion and t is the exchange interaction parameter.

The close correspondence of T_{c} vs x data with results based on AG theory [Eq. (2)] has been interpreted as an evidence for pair breaking.21-23 Spin-polarized electronic band-structure calculations24 for _R_Ba2Cu3O7-y (_R_ = Y, Gd, and Pr) also confirms the pair-breaking mechanism. AG theory (pair-breaking model) successfully explained the basic features of experiments, but the theory is difficult to explain the metal-insulator transition at larger Pr concentration in (Y1-_Pr_T)Ba2Cu3O7-y [34, 36, 21, 25]

Fehrenbacher and Rice26 proposed that the difference between PrBa2Cu3O7-y and other _R_Ba2Cu3O7-y comes from an enhanced stability of the PrV state due to the hybridization with oxygen neighbors, involving the transfer of holes from primary planar O 2_p_s or 2_p_p_ states. A particularly important unusual characteristic of Pr ions is its 4f wave function, while the other rare-earth ions are characterized by more symmetric orbital. Hybridization could generate an exchange interaction between the Pr magnetic moment and the mobile holes on CuO2 planes, leading to hole localization and/or pair breaking. Though this model has been widely used in discussion of Y1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y , it could not explain the rare-earth ion-size effect on T_{c} in the R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y system.27,28

After systematic studies of the superconducting and normal-state properties of the R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y system, Guan and co-workers reported that the superconducting transition temperature T_{c},27 the magnetic ordering temperature of Pr ions T_{N},28 the normal-state resistivity r,29,30 and the Hall number per unit cell n_{H} in R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y (Ref. 30) are all R ion-size dependent. It was also reported that the Hall number **n__H_** of R0,50a,Ba2Cu3O7-y (Ref. 31) and T_{c} of _R_Ba2Cu3-_x_Ga3O7-y (Ref. 32) are also ion-size dependent.

For a constant Pr concentration, T_{c} of R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y linearly decreases with increasing R ion radius, and the _c_-axis per unit cell increases with increasing R ion radius. One would expect the opposite trend based on the hybridization picture, since the average distance between CuO2 plane becomes larger leading to a weaker Pr-CuO2 hybridization. Khomdskii33 suggested that Pr can induce a lattice distortion, especially the buckling of the CuO2 plane. It was established that the distance between Pr and its surrounding oxygen, _d_Pr-O, is less than _d_Y-O. If _d_Pr-O keeps invariant in all R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y , one would expect a stronger buckling for R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y with larger R ion radius, leading to larger resistivity and stronger suppression of superconductivity.

Among all cation dopiness, Ca substitution for Y in YBCO has attracted much attention.34-40 The valence state of Ca2+ is lower than that of Y3+. Such a substitution will generate excess holes and T_{c} is suppressed by the overdoping effect. On the other hand, it has been known that Ca doping is likely to coinrotroduce oxygen vacancies, reducing the number of the generated holes. This indicates that doping with Ca ions has a counterbalance effect on the suppression of T_{c}.

Ca doping is able to increase the T_{c} of the oxygen-deficient YBCO.35 The replacement of 20% Ca ions in tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 induces the superconductivity; whereas the same amount of Ca, in fully oxygenated YBa2Cu3O7-y , lowers T_{c} from 90 to 78 K. Yakabe _et al._36 showed that there exists a maximum of T_{c} about 90 K with the variation of the carrier density in single phase Y1-_x_Ca,Ba2Cu3O7-y thin films up to 50% Ca concentration. Similar behavior was observed in Y1-_x_Ca,Ba2Cu2Cu3O6-y ,37 , Y1-_x_Ca,Ba2Cu2Se3O7-38 Y1-_x_Ca,Sr2Cu3O7-y , (_M_ = Ti, and R; y = 0.33 and 0.15), and Y1-_x_Ca,SrBaCu3-_y_M_,_y_O6+z (_M_ = Al, Co, Fe, and Ga, y = 0, 0.4).39 These observations indicate that the substitution of Ca2+ for Y3+ in these compounds compensates the loss of the holes and restores the superconductivity.

The T_{c} of Y1-_x_-_y_Pr_Ta_Ba2Cu3O7-z (Ref. 22) could be enhanced by Ca doping and there exists a maximum of T_{c} (T_{c},max) for varying Ca concentration y. The T_{c} vs y curves can be resolved into two parts: (1) the counteracting effects of generation and filling of holes on the CuO2 sheets by Ca2+ and Pr4+ ions, respectively, and (2) the depairing of superconducting electrons via exchange interaction of mobile holes on the CuO2 sheets with local Pr magnetic moments. Combining the features of both models, Neumeier _et al._22 suggested an empirical polynomial function,

\[T_{c} = T_{c0} - A\left( {\alpha - \beta x + y} \right)^{2} - Bx,\]

where _T__c_0 is the maximum obtained value of T_{c}, _A_(_a_ - _b_x_+_y_)2 is an empirical term that represents the effect of hole generation by Ca ions and hole filling by Pr ions, - a is an optimal hole concentration, b is the deviation of the effective valence, _t_(Pr), of Pr ions from +3 [i.e., _b_= _t_(Pr) - 3], - B_{x} describes the overall depression of T_{c} with x due to the pair-breaking mechanism.

In this paper we study the effect of codoping of Pr and Ca on T_{c} in R1-_x_-_y_Pr_Ta_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7-z (_R_ = Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, Sm, and Nd), and observe a rare-earth ion-size effect on T_{c} in these systems. For fixed Pr and Ca concentration, T_{c} is linearly dependent on rare-earth ion radius _r__R_3+ . We proposed an empirical formula for T_{c} (_r__R_3+ ,x,_y_) to fit our experimental data.

## II Experimental

Polycrystalline samples R1-_x_-_y_Pr_Ta_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7-z (_R_ = Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, Sm, and Nd) were prepared by standard solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometry amounts of high-purity R2O3, Pr6O11, CaCO3, BaCO3, and CuO powders were mixed, ground and calcined three times at 900, 910, 920 degC, respectively, for 24 h followed by furnace cooling to room temperature. Each time the powders were ground and mixed before next firing for ensuring the homogeneity of samples. The resultant powders were reground and pressed under the pressure 40 kg/cm3 into pellets, which were sintered in flowing oxygen at 930 degC for 30 h followed by a slow cooling to 680 degC staying for 8 h, and then slowly  cooled to 450 degC for 30 h before a final cool to room temperature.

The structure of the samples were examined by Rigaku Rotaflex rotating anode x-ray diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation with a wavelength = 1.5406 A. Differential thermal analysis was also carried out in several groups of samples to check the presence of other phases. T_{c} was determined from electrical resistivity measurement using a low-frequency (37 Hz) four-lead technique. The measuring current is limited to 20 _m_A. Electrical contacts to the samples were made by silver-paste epoxy. The dc magnetization was measured by a Quantum design superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer.

## III Results and Discussion

X-ray-diffraction patterns at room temperature show that all samples have layered orthorhombic perovskitelike structure and no extra peaks arising from the impurity phases within the experimental errors (<5%). As an example, the x-ray powder-diffraction patterns of Gd0.8-yPr0.2Ca3 Ba2Cu3O7-z are shown in Fig. 1. The additional peaks, labeled by symbol "_s_', are arising from silicon, added as a standard in order to determine the lattice parameters of our samples. These results indicate Ca doping (_y_  0.3) in _R_BCO does not yield impurity phases in bulk material.

The lattice parameters **a**, **b**, and **c** of Er0.8-yPr0.2 Ca3Ba2Cu3C7-z are shown in Fig. 2. The c axis increases with increasing Ca concentration y. It is due to that the radius of Ca ions (99 pm) is much larger than that of Er ions (89

  pm). This increment is reduced in other R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} system where the R ion radius is larger. The lattice parameter **b** decreases and **a** increases slightly with increasing Ca concentration y. These behaviors are similar to that reported in the Y_{1-x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system.[42] Yang _et al.[41]_ reported that the c axis of R(Ba_{1-x}Ca_{x})Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (R = Y and Pr) decreases abruptly, where Ca ions occupy the Ba site and it is just opposite to the observed result shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, we believe that the Ca ions replace the R site but not the Ba site in our R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} samples.

It was reported that in fully oxygenated YBCO, Ca doping is accompanied by the loss of oxygen content,[40] but it was also reported that the oxygen content does not change with Ca concentration in the Y_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} system.[22] It suggests that the loss of oxygen content, resulting from Ca doping, can be compensated by Pr doping. On the other hand, in oxygen-deficient YBCO,[42] the length of the c axis increases progressively with decreasing oxygen content. When the R ion radius is comparable to that of Ca ions in our R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} samples, the c axis does not increase apparently. (For example, in Eu_{0.8-y}Pr_{0.2}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, c = 11.698 A, when y = 0 and c = 11.707 A, when y = 0.2. r_{\rm Ba}^{\rm +} = 95 pm). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the oxygen content does not vary much in our samples.

The temperature dependence of dc molar magnetization M(T) of R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} was measured both in zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) over the temperature range 5-90 K in the magnetic field of 10 G. A typical result for Dy_{0.9-y}Pr_{0.1}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} is shown in Fig. 3. The M(T) curves demonstrate a superconducting transition with a "knee" in ZFC. It could be due to the granular character of the sintered samples. The superconducting transition of sintered pellets could be divided as a two-step process with first the transition of grains and followed by the transition of intergrain barriers or junctions at lower temperatures. The "knee"disappears when the sample is ground and when the powder dc magnetization measurements are performed as shown in Fig. 4.

Normal-state resistivity \rho(T) was measured in the tem

  perature range between T_{c} and 290 K. All samples are 'metallic' with linear temperature dependence before reaching the superconducting transition temperature. Typical resistivity vs temperature data \rho(T) for Dy_{0.9-y}Pr_{0.1}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are shown in Fig. 5. T_{c} is defined as the temperature at which \rho drops to 50% of its extrapolated normal-state resistivity.

The M(T) and \rho(T) of Eu_{0.9-y}Pr_{0.1}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} and Eu_{0.8-y}Pr_{0.2}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are shown in Figs. 6-9.

Both M(T) and \rho(T) of Eu_{0.8-y}Pr_{0.2}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} exhibit that T_{c} is raised by Ca doping before y reaches 0.2 and then decreases with more Ca doping due to the overdoping effect. There is a distinct maximum (T_{c,\max}) in T_{c} vs Ca concentration y. The enhancement of T_{c} (\Delta T_{c,\max}=T_{c,\max}-T_{c,\,y=0}\approx11 K at y = 0.2, T_{c,\,y=0} is the transition temperature T_{c} without Ca doping) is much larger than that in Y_{0.8-y}Pr_{0.2}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, ^{22} (\Delta T_{c,\max}=2.5 K at y = 0.1). For Pr concentration x = 0.1, the substitution of 5% Ca does not change T_{c} substantially and when y is increased to 0.1, T_{c} is decreased by 5.3 K indicative of T_{c,\max} located in the region 0<y<0.05.

Superconducting transition temperatures T_{c} as a function of R ion radius r_{R}^{3+} for R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are shown in Fig. 10 (x = 0.1) and Fig. 11 (x = 0.2), which demonstrate that T_{c} decreases approximately linearly with increasing r_{R}^{3+}. The solid lines in the figures are the linear fitting. The observed rare-earth ion size effect on T_{c} in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} systems is similar to that in

Figure 12: -(dT_{c}/dr_{R}^{3+}) vs Ca concentration y for R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}BCO. The lines drawn through the data are guides to the eyes.

  R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} systems in our previous reports.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]

The negative slope of the solid lines in Figs. 10 and 11, -\,dT_{c}/dr_{R}^{3+}, are plotted in Fig. 12. For x\!=\!0.2, the -\,dT_{c}/dr_{R}^{3+} decreases monotonically with increasing Ca concentration y. For x\!=\!0.1, the -\,dT_{c}/dr_{R}^{3+} decreases with increasing Ca concentration y in the region 0<y<0.1, but saturates at about y\!=\!0.15. These results imply that the rare-earth ion size dependence of T_{c} is weaker in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} for increasing Ca concentration y and that the trend of rare-earth ion size effect on T_{c} for Ca-doped RBCO is opposite to that for Pr-doped RBCO.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]

T_{c} of R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} for x\!=\!0.1 and x\!=\!0.2 as a function of Ca concentration y are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively. In the case of Pr concentration x\!=\!0.1 (Fig. 13), the monotonic decrease of T_{c} with increasing Ca concentration y for samples with a smaller R ion (Dy and Gd) implies that the T_{c,\max}, possibly, locates in the region 0<y<0.05. For Pr concentration x\!=\!0.2 (Fig. 14), a T_{c,\max} is clearly visible in each series. For a sample with a larger R ion radius, T_{c,\max} in T_{c} vs y curves shifts to higher Ca concentration y, which reveals that a larger number of Ca ions are required to compensate the reduction of the mobile holes. Figure 14 indicates that the enhancement of T_{c} (\Delta T_{c,\max}) becomes larger for sample with a larger R ion radius.

In order to make a quantitative analysis for T_{c}(x,y), we fit our data using the Eq. (3), T_{c}\!=\!T_{c0}\!-\!A(\alpha\!-\!\beta x\!+\!y)^{2}-Bx.

Typical results of fitting for Dy_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} and Gd_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are shown in Figs. 15 and 16. The symbols represent the T_{c}, obtained from resistivity measurements, associated with the vertical bars indicating the transition width. The resultant parameters of fitting for R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (R\!=\! Y, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd) are shown in Table I. Some parameters, for example, A and \alpha, seem scattered with respect to R ion radius. It is inconsistent with the results that T_{c}(r_{R}^{3+},x,y) itself depends on the R ion radius linearly for fixed x and y as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. This discrepancy might be due to the fact that Ca ions do not contribute an equal number of holes to CuO_{2} planes for samples with different R ion radius.

  Guan _et al._[31] reported that the Hall number **n_{H}** (cell^{- 1}) of R0.9CaO_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) increases with decreasing R ion radius. In Nd_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, and Tm_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} systems, **n_{H}** (cell^{- 1}) at 100 K is about 0.5 and 2.0, respectively. For pure _R_BCO, **n_{H}** at 100 K is about 0.4 in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, and 0.6 in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}.[4, 25] It should be noticed that the difference of **n_{H}** between Nd_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} and Tm_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} is much larger (about 7 times) than that between NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}. It suggests that Ca ions contribute much more mobile holes to CuO_{2} sheets in Tm_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} than in Nd_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}. On the other hand, the reported **n_{H}** is about 0.3 in Nd_{0.9}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (Ref. [30]) and 0.4 in Y_{0.9}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}.[43] The difference of **n_{H}** between them is also as small as that between NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}. We suggest that the Eq. (3) should be modified to following form:

\[T_{c}(x,y)=T_{c0}-A\,\beta^{2}(\alpha/\beta-x+y/\beta)^{2}-Bx,\] (4)

where A\,\beta^{2}(\alpha/\beta-x+y/\beta)^{2} is equivalent to A\,(\alpha-\beta x+y)^{2} in Eq. (3), -\,\alpha/\beta is an optimal hole concentration, and 1/\beta is the number of holes contributed by a Ca ion to CuO_{2} planes. The parameters in Eq. (4), T_{c0}, B, \beta, \alpha/\beta, and A\,\beta^{2}, as a function of R ion radius are shown in Fig. 17. Our data established that all parameters, T_{c0}, A\,\beta^{2}, B, \alpha/\beta, and \beta, depend on the R ion radius linearly.

The parameter B increases with increasing R ion radius, indicating a stronger pair-breaking effect due to Pr doping for a sample with larger R ion radius, which is consistent with the R ion-size effect observed in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]

T_{c0} increases slightly with increasing R ion radius. This result is in accordance with the earlier results for pure RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}.[1]\alpha/\beta is positive and decreases with increasing R ion radius, indicating that the pure and fully oxygenated RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are all in the overdoped region.

\beta increases with increasing R ion radius, indicating that

  the number of holes contributed by Ca ions decreases with increasing R ion radius. \beta could be fitted by a linear relation, \beta\!=\!-8.9+0.11r_{R}^{3+}.

Guan _et al._[31] reported that the Hall number {\bf n}_{H} (cell^{-1}) of R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (R\!=\!Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) increases linearly with respect to (r_{R}^{3+}-r_{C_{A}}^{2+})^{2}. Especially noteworthy are that 1/\beta is the number of holes contributed by a Ca ion to CuO_{2} planes and it should be related to mobile holes, {\bf n}_{H}. As illustrated in Fig. 18, the measured {\bf n}_{H} (Ref. [31]) is, indeed, proportional to 1/(0.11r_{R}^{3+}\!-8.9). It strongly supports the validity of Eq. (4).

The parameter A\,\beta^{2} increases with increasing R ion radius, suggesting a sharper carrier concentration dependence of T_{c} for sample with larger R ion radius.

Finally, an overall T_{c} as a function of r_{R}^{3+}, x, and y in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} is proposed. All parameters in Eq. (4), T_{c0}, A\,\beta^{2}, B, \alpha\beta, and \beta, depend on the R ion radius linearly (see Fig. 17):

###### Abstract

We observed a rare-earth ion-size effect on T_{c} in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (R=Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, Sm, and Nd) systems which is similar to that in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} systems in our previous reports. For fixed Pr and Ca concentration (fixed x and y), T_{c} is linearly dependent on rare-earth ion radius r_{K}^{3+}. For a fixed Pr concentration x, there exists a maximum of T_{c} (T_{c,\max}) in T_{c} vs Ca concentration y curves. T_{c,\max} shifts to higher Ca concentration region for samples with larger R ion radius. The enhancement of T_{c} (\Delta T_{c,\max} =T_{c,\max}-T_{c,y=0}; T_{c,y=0} is the transition temperature T_{c} without Ca doping) increases with increasing R ion radius. We proposed an empirical formula for T_{c} (r_{K}^{3+},x,y) to fit our experimental data: T_{c}(x,y)=T_{c,0}-A\beta^{2}(\alpha/x+y/\beta)^{2}-Bx. All fitting parameters in this formula, T_{c0}, B, \beta, \alpha/\beta, and A\beta^{2}, are rare-earth ion-size dependent. [S0163-1829(99)01506-4]

## 1 Introduction

The substitution of Y by trivalent rare-earth elements in orthorhombic YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (YBCO), yields a superconducting phase with T_{c} identical to YBCO,[1] except for Ce, Tb, Pm, and Pr. It shows that the magnetic moments of the lanthanide ions have a weak effect on the CuO_{2} sheets. The insensitivity of the superconducting properties to the substitution is presumably due to their layered structure and the nearly complete lack of interaction between rare-earth and CuO_{2} sheets.[2]

Although crystallographically identical to all the other rare-earth-based superconductors, PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (PrBCO) inhibits the superconducting and metallic behavior.[3, 4, 5] The Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system is particularly interesting since it is isostructural to YBCO, yet the superconductivity is strongly suppressed as a function of Pr concentration.

The suppression of T_{c} by Pr doping in Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2} Cu_{3}O_{7-y} has been attributed to several possible mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the filling of holes (hole filling) in CuO_{2} sheets due to the substitution of Pr ions with its valence greater than +3 and, hence, implies the suppression of superconductivity and metallic behavior, arising from a reduced number of carriers (holes) in CuO_{2} sheets. Indeed, magnetic susceptibility,[4, 5, 6] Hall measurements,[5] thermoelectric power,[7] muon spin resonance,[8] neutron diffraction,[9] specific-heat measurement,[10] and x-ray-absorption spectroscopy[11] are consistent with a Pr valence substantially larger than 3+. Superconductivity observed in a Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} film[12] strongly supports this mechanism. Based on the spin-polaron model, Wood[13] obtained an agreement with experimental data for a Pr concentration dependence of T_{c} in the Y_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system.

However, this idea was later questioned. X-ray-absorption near-edge spectroscopy,[14] valence-band resonant photoemission,[15] lattice constant[16] and Raman spectrum[17] indicate a Pr valence close to 3+. According to electron-energy-loss spectroscopy measurement,[18] the total number of holes on O sites was shown to be independent of Pr concentration x. It suggests that Pr ions are trivalent and localize, rather than fill, the mobile holes on CuO_{2} planes. The localization leads to the suppression of superconductivity and induces a metal-insulator transition. In fact, most experimental results supporting hole filling would also support hole localization. Recently, Kao, Yu, and Guan[19] measured the hole concentration p per unit cell by using iodometric titration technique for (Gd_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (x= 0.1- 0.9) and (R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} (R= Yb, Er, Dy, Gd, and Nd) samples. The chemical hole concentration p was compared to the Hall number \mathbf{n}_{H} and T_{c} reported in literature. What is most surprising is that the total carrier concentration p is independent of Pr concentration and remains primarily constant even when the samples are not superconducting in higher Pr concentration region (x\geq 0.5) in (Gd_{1-x}Pr_{x})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}.[19] It should also be noted that the total carrier concentration p remains primarily constant even when T_{c} is changed by almost 100% with the changing of R ions in (R_{0.8}Pr_{0.2})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y}.[19] The authors proposed that the total hole concentration p measured by iodometric technique is not changed with Pr doping but the concentration of mobile holes \mathbf{n}_{H} measured by the Hall effect is changed with T_{c} and Pr doping. It strongly suggests that T_{c} suppression appears to be caused by hole localization rather than hole filling.

The second mechanism for T_{c} suppression involves the spin-flip effect of the pairing electrons (pair breaking), being explained on the basis of Abrikosov-Gor'kov (AG) theory,[20] which has been used widely and successfully for interpretation of conventional alloy superconductors with paramagnetic doping. This model suggests Pr ion acts as a strong magnetic pair breaker.[21, 22, 6, 23] AG theory predicts that a reduced transition temperature T_{c}/T_{c0} will be a universal function of the reduced concentration x/x_{\rm cr},

\[\ln\{T_{c}/T_{c0}\}=\Psi(1/2)-\Psi(1/2+0.14xT_{c0}/x_{\rm cr}T_{c}),\] (1)

where T_{c0} is the T_{c} for ''pure'' material (without doping), x_{\rm cr} is the critical concentration for complete suppression of superconductivity and Ps is a digamma function. For _x__m_0, it gives an asymptotic form,

\[T_{c} = T_{c0} - \left[ {\left( {\pi /4k_{B}} \right)N\left( {E_{F}} \right)\tau^{2}\left( {g - 1} \right)^{2}J\left( {J + 1} \right)} \right]x,\]

where _N_(E_{F}) is the density of state at Fermi level and g and J, respectively, the Lande g factor and the total angular momentum of Hund's rules ground state of the Pr ion and t is the exchange interaction parameter.

The close correspondence of T_{c} vs x data with results based on AG theory [Eq. (2)] has been interpreted as an evidence for pair breaking.21-23 Spin-polarized electronic band-structure calculations24 for _R_Ba2Cu3O7-y (_R_ = Y, Gd, and Pr) also confirms the pair-breaking mechanism. AG theory (pair-breaking model) successfully explained the basic features of experiments, but the theory is difficult to explain the metal-insulator transition at larger Pr concentration in (Y1-_Pr_T)Ba2Cu3O7-y [34, 36, 21, 25]

Fehrenbacher and Rice26 proposed that the difference between PrBa2Cu3O7-y and other _R_Ba2Cu3O7-y comes from an enhanced stability of the PrV state due to the hybridization with oxygen neighbors, involving the transfer of holes from primary planar O 2_p_s or 2_p_p_ states. A particularly important unusual characteristic of Pr ions is its 4f wave function, while the other rare-earth ions are characterized by more symmetric orbital. Hybridization could generate an exchange interaction between the Pr magnetic moment and the mobile holes on CuO2 planes, leading to hole localization and/or pair breaking. Though this model has been widely used in discussion of Y1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y , it could not explain the rare-earth ion-size effect on T_{c} in the R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y system.27,28

After systematic studies of the superconducting and normal-state properties of the R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y system, Guan and co-workers reported that the superconducting transition temperature T_{c},27 the magnetic ordering temperature of Pr ions T_{N},28 the normal-state resistivity r,29,30 and the Hall number per unit cell n_{H} in R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y (Ref. 30) are all R ion-size dependent. It was also reported that the Hall number **n__H_** of R0,50a,Ba2Cu3O7-y (Ref. 31) and T_{c} of _R_Ba2Cu3-_x_Ga3O7-y (Ref. 32) are also ion-size dependent.

For a constant Pr concentration, T_{c} of R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y linearly decreases with increasing R ion radius, and the _c_-axis per unit cell increases with increasing R ion radius. One would expect the opposite trend based on the hybridization picture, since the average distance between CuO2 plane becomes larger leading to a weaker Pr-CuO2 hybridization. Khomdskii33 suggested that Pr can induce a lattice distortion, especially the buckling of the CuO2 plane. It was established that the distance between Pr and its surrounding oxygen, _d_Pr-O, is less than _d_Y-O. If _d_Pr-O keeps invariant in all R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y , one would expect a stronger buckling for R1-_x_Pr_Ba2Cu3O7-y with larger R ion radius, leading to larger resistivity and stronger suppression of superconductivity.

Among all cation dopiness, Ca substitution for Y in YBCO has attracted much attention.34-40 The valence state of Ca2+ is lower than that of Y3+. Such a substitution will generate excess holes and T_{c} is suppressed by the overdoping effect. On the other hand, it has been known that Ca doping is likely to coinrotroduce oxygen vacancies, reducing the number of the generated holes. This indicates that doping with Ca ions has a counterbalance effect on the suppression of T_{c}.

Ca doping is able to increase the T_{c} of the oxygen-deficient YBCO.35 The replacement of 20% Ca ions in tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 induces the superconductivity; whereas the same amount of Ca, in fully oxygenated YBa2Cu3O7-y , lowers T_{c} from 90 to 78 K. Yakabe _et al._36 showed that there exists a maximum of T_{c} about 90 K with the variation of the carrier density in single phase Y1-_x_Ca,Ba2Cu3O7-y thin films up to 50% Ca concentration. Similar behavior was observed in Y1-_x_Ca,Ba2Cu2Cu3O6-y ,37 , Y1-_x_Ca,Ba2Cu2Se3O7-38 Y1-_x_Ca,Sr2Cu3O7-y , (_M_ = Ti, and R; y = 0.33 and 0.15), and Y1-_x_Ca,SrBaCu3-_y_M_,_y_O6+z (_M_ = Al, Co, Fe, and Ga, y = 0, 0.4).39 These observations indicate that the substitution of Ca2+ for Y3+ in these compounds compensates the loss of the holes and restores the superconductivity.

The T_{c} of Y1-_x_-_y_Pr_Ta_Ba2Cu3O7-z (Ref. 22) could be enhanced by Ca doping and there exists a maximum of T_{c} (T_{c},max) for varying Ca concentration y. The T_{c} vs y curves can be resolved into two parts: (1) the counteracting effects of generation and filling of holes on the CuO2 sheets by Ca2+ and Pr4+ ions, respectively, and (2) the depairing of superconducting electrons via exchange interaction of mobile holes on the CuO2 sheets with local Pr magnetic moments. Combining the features of both models, Neumeier _et al._22 suggested an empirical polynomial function,

\[T_{c} = T_{c0} - A\left( {\alpha - \beta x + y} \right)^{2} - Bx,\]

where _T__c_0 is the maximum obtained value of T_{c}, _A_(_a_ - _b_x_+_y_)2 is an empirical term that represents the effect of hole generation by Ca ions and hole filling by Pr ions, - a is an optimal hole concentration, b is the deviation of the effective valence, _t_(Pr), of Pr ions from +3 [i.e., _b_= _t_(Pr) - 3], - B_{x} describes the overall depression of T_{c} with x due to the pair-breaking mechanism.

In this paper we study the effect of codoping of Pr and Ca on T_{c} in R1-_x_-_y_Pr_Ta_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7-z (_R_ = Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, Sm, and Nd), and observe a rare-earth ion-size effect on T_{c} in these systems. For fixed Pr and Ca concentration, T_{c} is linearly dependent on rare-earth ion radius _r__R_3+ . We proposed an empirical formula for T_{c} (_r__R_3+ ,x,_y_) to fit our experimental data.

## II Experimental

Polycrystalline samples R1-_x_-_y_Pr_Ta_Ca3Ba2Cu3O7-z (_R_ = Er, Dy, Gd, Eu, Sm, and Nd) were prepared by standard solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometry amounts of high-purity R2O3, Pr6O11, CaCO3, BaCO3, and CuO powders were mixed, ground and calcined three times at 900, 910, 920 degC, respectively, for 24 h followed by furnace cooling to room temperature. Each time the powders were ground and mixed before next firing for ensuring the homogeneity of samples. The resultant powders were reground and pressed under the pressure 40 kg/cm3 into pellets, which were sintered in flowing oxygen at 930 degC for 30 h followed by a slow cooling to 680 degC staying for 8 h, and then slowly  cooled to 450 degC for 30 h before a final cool to room temperature.

The structure of the samples were examined by Rigaku Rotaflex rotating anode x-ray diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation with a wavelength = 1.5406 A. Differential thermal analysis was also carried out in several groups of samples to check the presence of other phases. T_{c} was determined from electrical resistivity measurement using a low-frequency (37 Hz) four-lead technique. The measuring current is limited to 20 _m_A. Electrical contacts to the samples were made by silver-paste epoxy. The dc magnetization was measured by a Quantum design superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer.

## III Results and Discussion

X-ray-diffraction patterns at room temperature show that all samples have layered orthorhombic perovskitelike structure and no extra peaks arising from the impurity phases within the experimental errors (<5%). As an example, the x-ray powder-diffraction patterns of Gd0.8-yPr0.2Ca3 Ba2Cu3O7-z are shown in Fig. 1. The additional peaks, labeled by symbol "_s_', are arising from silicon, added as a standard in order to determine the lattice parameters of our samples. These results indicate Ca doping (_y_  0.3) in _R_BCO does not yield impurity phases in bulk material.

The lattice parameters **a**, **b**, and **c** of Er0.8-yPr0.2 Ca3Ba2Cu3C7-z are shown in Fig. 2. The c axis increases with increasing Ca concentration y. It is due to that the radius of Ca ions (99 pm) is much larger than that of Er ions (89

  pm). This increment is reduced in other R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} system where the R ion radius is larger. The lattice parameter **b** decreases and **a** increases slightly with increasing Ca concentration y. These behaviors are similar to that reported in the Y_{1-x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-y} system.[42] Yang _et al.[41]_ reported that the c axis of R(Ba_{1-x}Ca_{x})Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (R = Y and Pr) decreases abruptly, where Ca ions occupy the Ba site and it is just opposite to the observed result shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, we believe that the Ca ions replace the R site but not the Ba site in our R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} samples.

It was reported that in fully oxygenated YBCO, Ca doping is accompanied by the loss of oxygen content,[40] but it was also reported that the oxygen content does not change with Ca concentration in the Y_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} system.[22] It suggests that the loss of oxygen content, resulting from Ca doping, can be compensated by Pr doping. On the other hand, in oxygen-deficient YBCO,[42] the length of the c axis increases progressively with decreasing oxygen content. When the R ion radius is comparable to that of Ca ions in our R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} samples, the c axis does not increase apparently. (For example, in Eu_{0.8-y}Pr_{0.2}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, c = 11.698 A, when y = 0 and c = 11.707 A, when y = 0.2. r_{\rm Ba}^{\rm +} = 95 pm). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the oxygen content does not vary much in our samples.

The temperature dependence of dc molar magnetization M(T) of R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} was measured both in zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) over the temperature range 5-90 K in the magnetic field of 10 G. A typical result for Dy_{0.9-y}Pr_{0.1}Ca_{3}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} is shown in Fig. 3. The M(T) curves demonstrate a superconducting transition with a "knee" in ZFC. It could be due to the granular character of the sintered samples. The superconducting transition of sintered pellets could be divided as a two-step process with first the transition of grains and followed by the transition of intergrain barriers or junctions at lower temperatures. The "knee"disappears when the sample is ground and when the powder dc magnetization measurements are performed as shown in Fig. 4.

Normal-state resistivity \rho(T) was measured in the tem

  perature range between T_{c} and 290 K. All samples are 'metallic' with linear temperature dependence before reaching the superconducting transition temperature. Typical resistivity vs temperature data \rho(T) for Dy_{0.9-y}Pr_{0.1}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are shown in Fig. 5. T_{c} is defined as the temperature at which \rho drops to 50% of its extrapolated normal-state resistivity.

The M(T) and \rho(T) of Eu_{0.9-y}Pr_{0.1}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} and Eu_{0.8-y}Pr_{0.2}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are shown in Figs. 6-9.

Both M(T) and \rho(T) of Eu_{0.8-y}Pr_{0.2}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} exhibit that T_{c} is raised by Ca doping before y reaches 0.2 and then decreases with more Ca doping due to the overdoping effect. There is a distinct maximum (T_{c,\max}) in T_{c} vs Ca concentration y. The enhancement of T_{c} (\Delta T_{c,\max}=T_{c,\max}-T_{c,\,y=0}\approx11 K at y = 0.2, T_{c,\,y=0} is the transition temperature T_{c} without Ca doping) is much larger than that in Y_{0.8-y}Pr_{0.2}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, ^{22} (\Delta T_{c,\max}=2.5 K at y = 0.1). For Pr concentration x = 0.1, the substitution of 5% Ca does not change T_{c} substantially and when y is increased to 0.1, T_{c} is decreased by 5.3 K indicative of T_{c,\max} located in the region 0<y<0.05.

Superconducting transition temperatures T_{c} as a function of R ion radius r_{R}^{3+} for R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are shown in Fig. 10 (x = 0.1) and Fig. 11 (x = 0.2), which demonstrate that T_{c} decreases approximately linearly with increasing r_{R}^{3+}. The solid lines in the figures are the linear fitting. The observed rare-earth ion size effect on T_{c} in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} systems is similar to that in

Figure 12: -(dT_{c}/dr_{R}^{3+}) vs Ca concentration y for R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}BCO. The lines drawn through the data are guides to the eyes.

  R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} systems in our previous reports.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]

The negative slope of the solid lines in Figs. 10 and 11, -\,dT_{c}/dr_{R}^{3+}, are plotted in Fig. 12. For x\!=\!0.2, the -\,dT_{c}/dr_{R}^{3+} decreases monotonically with increasing Ca concentration y. For x\!=\!0.1, the -\,dT_{c}/dr_{R}^{3+} decreases with increasing Ca concentration y in the region 0<y<0.1, but saturates at about y\!=\!0.15. These results imply that the rare-earth ion size dependence of T_{c} is weaker in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} for increasing Ca concentration y and that the trend of rare-earth ion size effect on T_{c} for Ca-doped RBCO is opposite to that for Pr-doped RBCO.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]

T_{c} of R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} for x\!=\!0.1 and x\!=\!0.2 as a function of Ca concentration y are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively. In the case of Pr concentration x\!=\!0.1 (Fig. 13), the monotonic decrease of T_{c} with increasing Ca concentration y for samples with a smaller R ion (Dy and Gd) implies that the T_{c,\max}, possibly, locates in the region 0<y<0.05. For Pr concentration x\!=\!0.2 (Fig. 14), a T_{c,\max} is clearly visible in each series. For a sample with a larger R ion radius, T_{c,\max} in T_{c} vs y curves shifts to higher Ca concentration y, which reveals that a larger number of Ca ions are required to compensate the reduction of the mobile holes. Figure 14 indicates that the enhancement of T_{c} (\Delta T_{c,\max}) becomes larger for sample with a larger R ion radius.

In order to make a quantitative analysis for T_{c}(x,y), we fit our data using the Eq. (3), T_{c}\!=\!T_{c0}\!-\!A(\alpha\!-\!\beta x\!+\!y)^{2}-Bx.

Typical results of fitting for Dy_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} and Gd_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are shown in Figs. 15 and 16. The symbols represent the T_{c}, obtained from resistivity measurements, associated with the vertical bars indicating the transition width. The resultant parameters of fitting for R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (R\!=\! Y, Dy, Gd, Eu, and Nd) are shown in Table I. Some parameters, for example, A and \alpha, seem scattered with respect to R ion radius. It is inconsistent with the results that T_{c}(r_{R}^{3+},x,y) itself depends on the R ion radius linearly for fixed x and y as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. This discrepancy might be due to the fact that Ca ions do not contribute an equal number of holes to CuO_{2} planes for samples with different R ion radius.

  Guan _et al._[31] reported that the Hall number **n_{H}** (cell^{- 1}) of R0.9CaO_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (_R_ = Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) increases with decreasing R ion radius. In Nd_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, and Tm_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} systems, **n_{H}** (cell^{- 1}) at 100 K is about 0.5 and 2.0, respectively. For pure _R_BCO, **n_{H}** at 100 K is about 0.4 in NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, and 0.6 in YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}.[4, 25] It should be noticed that the difference of **n_{H}** between Nd_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} and Tm_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} is much larger (about 7 times) than that between NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}, and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}. It suggests that Ca ions contribute much more mobile holes to CuO_{2} sheets in Tm_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} than in Nd_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}. On the other hand, the reported **n_{H}** is about 0.3 in Nd_{0.9}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (Ref. [30]) and 0.4 in Y_{0.9}Pr_{0.2}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}.[43] The difference of **n_{H}** between them is also as small as that between NdBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} and YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}. We suggest that the Eq. (3) should be modified to following form:

\[T_{c}(x,y)=T_{c0}-A\,\beta^{2}(\alpha/\beta-x+y/\beta)^{2}-Bx,\] (4)

where A\,\beta^{2}(\alpha/\beta-x+y/\beta)^{2} is equivalent to A\,(\alpha-\beta x+y)^{2} in Eq. (3), -\,\alpha/\beta is an optimal hole concentration, and 1/\beta is the number of holes contributed by a Ca ion to CuO_{2} planes. The parameters in Eq. (4), T_{c0}, B, \beta, \alpha/\beta, and A\,\beta^{2}, as a function of R ion radius are shown in Fig. 17. Our data established that all parameters, T_{c0}, A\,\beta^{2}, B, \alpha/\beta, and \beta, depend on the R ion radius linearly.

The parameter B increases with increasing R ion radius, indicating a stronger pair-breaking effect due to Pr doping for a sample with larger R ion radius, which is consistent with the R ion-size effect observed in R_{1-x}Pr_{x}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}.[27, 28, 29, 30, 31]

T_{c0} increases slightly with increasing R ion radius. This result is in accordance with the earlier results for pure RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z}.[1]\alpha/\beta is positive and decreases with increasing R ion radius, indicating that the pure and fully oxygenated RBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} are all in the overdoped region.

\beta increases with increasing R ion radius, indicating that

  the number of holes contributed by Ca ions decreases with increasing R ion radius. \beta could be fitted by a linear relation, \beta\!=\!-8.9+0.11r_{R}^{3+}.

Guan _et al._[31] reported that the Hall number {\bf n}_{H} (cell^{-1}) of R_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} (R\!=\!Tm, Ho, Gd, and Nd) increases linearly with respect to (r_{R}^{3+}-r_{C_{A}}^{2+})^{2}. Especially noteworthy are that 1/\beta is the number of holes contributed by a Ca ion to CuO_{2} planes and it should be related to mobile holes, {\bf n}_{H}. As illustrated in Fig. 18, the measured {\bf n}_{H} (Ref. [31]) is, indeed, proportional to 1/(0.11r_{R}^{3+}\!-8.9). It strongly supports the validity of Eq. (4).

The parameter A\,\beta^{2} increases with increasing R ion radius, suggesting a sharper carrier concentration dependence of T_{c} for sample with larger R ion radius.

Finally, an overall T_{c} as a function of r_{R}^{3+}, x, and y in R_{1-x-y}Pr_{x}Ca_{y}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-z} is proposed. All parameters in Eq. (4), T_{c0}, A\,\beta^{2}, B, \alpha\beta, and \beta, depend on the R ion radius linearly (see Fig. 17):

\[T_{c}(r_{R}^{3+},x,y) = (55\!+\!0.46r_{R}^{3+})-(56r_{R}^{3+}\!-\!4800)[0.47\!-\!3.9\] (5) \[\times 10^{-3}r_{R}^{3+}\!-\!x\!+\!y/(0.11r_{R}^{3+}\!-\!8.9)]^{2}\] \[+(17r_{R}^{3+}\!-\!1400)x,\quad\mbox{for}\quad r_{R}^  * [22] J.
