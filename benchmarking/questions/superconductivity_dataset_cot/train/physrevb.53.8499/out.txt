###### Abstract

The anisotropic magnetization _M_(_T_) of single-crystal TbNi2B2C is reported as a function of applied magnetic field (**H**) for temperatures T from 2 to 300 K and with **H** parallel and perpendicular to the c axis (**H**[**c** and **H**L**_c_). In low field (_H_ <= 100 G) TbNi2B2C orders antiferromagnetically at Neel temperature T_{N} = (14.9 +- 0.1) K. Weak ferromagnetic (WF) behavior is found for T <= 8 K and H <= 10 kG. Both phase transitions are also detected in zero-field in-plane resistivity r_{b}(_T_) measurements. In contrast, previous low-field _M_(_T_,_H_) data showed antiferromagnetic ground states for (Gd,DyHo,Er,Tm)Ni2B2C crystals. The origin of the WF ordering, given the point symmetry (4/_mmm_) of the Tb + 3 ions, is addressed together with the observed in-plane anisotropy in the high-field magnetization. Possible reasons for the absence of superconductivity above 2 K in TbNi2B2C are also discussed. Finally, a partial _H_-_T_ magnetic phase diagram of TbNi2B2C is presented for **H**[[110] and aspects of the similar _H_-_T_ diagram for **H**[[100] are discussed.

## Introduction

The _R_Ni2B2C series of compounds exhibits a wide variety of low-temperature (_T_) ground states ranging from superconductivity (_R_ = Lu, Sc, Y, Th), to superconductivity coexisting with magnetic order (_R_ = Tm, Er, Ho, and Dy), to magnetic order without superconductivity (_R_ = Gd).1-7 These compounds crystallize in a layered crystal structure, which consists of the body-centered-tetragonal (bct) TbCr2Si2 structure with additional carbon atoms in each R layer.8 Theoretically these compounds are expected to show electronically three-dimensional behavior and conventional BCS-type superconductivity.9 Experimentally the R = Tm, Er, Ho compounds undergo antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the superconducting state and display an interplay between the magnetic ordering and the superconductivity in resistivity measurements of polycrystalline samples.2 Moreover, single crystals of each compound containing magnetic R atoms possess highly anisotropic normal-state magnetizations and also anisotropic and suppressed superconducting state properties, indicating the existence of significant interactions between the local magnetic moments and the superconducting electrons.4-6 More recently the discovery of superconductivity at T_{m}  6 K in single-crystal and polycrystalline DyNi2B2C below the AF ordering temperature T_{N}  10.3 K provided a rare example of superconductivity evolving out of an AF ground state.7 GdNi2B2C, on the other hand, does not become superconducting for T > 2 K.2,10 even though it orders antiferromagnetically below 20 K.10 Thus, with GdNi2B2C and DyNi2B2C as neighboring compounds, it is interesting to study the electronic and magnetic properties of single-crystal TbNi2B2C, which does not show any indication of superconductivity above 2 K in polycrystalline form.2

In this report, we present electronic transport and static magnetization (_M_) data of single-crystal TbNi2B2C. It is found that in addition to similarities with the R = Dy, Tm, Er, and Ho compounds, a new feature, a weak ferromagnetic (WF) component, develops at T  9 K, below T_{N} = 14.9 K, and at low ( <= 10 kG) magnetic fields H. We will discuss the magnetic anisotropy in the normal state in terms of crystalline electric-field (CEF) effects and the possible origin of WF together with the in-plane magnetization anisotropy of TbNi2B2C. We will also discuss possible reasons for the lack of superconductivity in TbNi2B2C based on the measured data.

## Experimental details

Crystals of TbNi2B2C were grown by the Ames Lab Ni2B flux method.5,11 This method yields plates of TbNi2B2C with masses up to 300 mg with the crystallographic _c_-axis perpendicular to the plate surface. Powder x-ray-diffraction patterns of crushed single crystals show the crystals to be single phase. The three crystallographic axes ([100], [110], and [001]) were determined by Laue x-ray diffraction for the crystal which was used for magnetization measurements. _M_(_H_,_T_) data were measured using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. A Linear Research Inc. LR400 four-wire ac resistance bridge was used in conjunction with the T and H environmental control of the SQUID magnetometer to measure in-plane four-probe resistivity as a function of temperature.

## Results

Figure 1(a) shows _M_(_T_)/_H_ of single-crystal TbNi2B2C for **H**[[001] (_M_001) and **H**[[100] (_M_100) with H = 10 kG. Figure 1(b) shows inverse _M_(_T_)/_H_ data together with a calculated powder averaged curve \left[ {(2M_{100} + M_{001})/3H} \right]^{- 1}. The magnetization data are highly anisotropic, with a larger magnetization for **H**[[100] than for **H**][[001]. The inverse _M_(_T_)/_H_ data for both field orientations in Fig. 1(b) show nearly linear behaviors above ~100 K and deviate from the linear behaviors below 100 K for both directions of **H**. The inverse _M_(_T_)/_H_ of the powder average reveals a linear behavior for the whole temperature range above 15 K, concealing (averaging) the deviations observed for **H**[**c** and **H**L** below ~100 K. Similar effects have already been seen in other _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C (_R_ = Tm, Er, and Ho) single crystals.4-6 The data above 100 K are fit to the Curie-Weiss law _M_/_H_ = _C_/(_T_ - _th_), where the Curie constant C = _N_m_  T_{N} value, defined as the temperature of maximum d(MT)/HdT, decreases from 14.95 K at H = 1 kG to 10.5 K at 20 kG, which is similar to T_{N}(H) of single-crystal (Ho, Er)Ni2B2C.[5, 6] Above 25 kG, the AF ordering disappears and the magnetization saturates below 5 K to between 8.2_m__B_ and 8.7_m__B_, depending on the applied field. These data indicate that a field-induced magnetic phase transition occurs for 20 kG \leq_H_ \leq25 kG below 10 K. The phase transition observed in magnetization data in Fig. 1 and in the transport measurement in Fig. 2 near T = 8 K is observed for H = 1 kG as an increase of magnetization below 9 K, with M \approx 0.4_m__B_ at 2 K, indicating that a weak ferromagnetic (WF) component may develop out of the antiferromagnetic state for small applied magnetic fields. Above 10 kG, the feature near 8 K seems not to exist anymore indicating the possibility of a second magnetic phase transition.

In order to further understand the low-temperature and low-field region, we obtained _M_(_T_) data with H = 100 G and _M_(_H_) data at T = 2 K which are plotted in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. In Fig. 4, in addition to the AF transition at _T__N_^{\infty}15 K, the WF component is seen to develop below \approx 9 K and saturates below \approx 4 K. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization shows a lower saturation value at 2 K (0.22 m_{B}) and higher onset temperature (\approx 9 K) of the weak ferromagnetism than the field-cooling (FC) magnetization (0.25_m__B_ and \approx 8 K, respectively). Figure 5 shows a magnetic isotherm at 2 K. Whereas there is a hysteresis between the virgin curve 1 and the magnetization for field ramping down (curve 2), no noticeable hysteresis is found in the subsequent field sweeps indicated with arrows and numbers in Fig. 5. Extrapolating the higher field (500-1000 G) linear regions to zero field gives a saturated WF moment of 0.5_m__B_.

To investigate the low-temperature magnetization anisotropy of the crystal, field-dependent magnetization measurements were performed at 2 K with the field applied in three different crystallographic directions, i.e., **H**\left[ 100\right], [110], and [001], and the results are plotted in Fig. 6. There are large anisotropies between all three orientations, i.e., not only between **H**\left[ 100\right] and **H**\left[ 001\right] but also within the _ab_ plane, between **H**\left[ 100\right] and **H**\left[ 110\right]. M001 is smaller than

  both M100 and M110 and shows no field-induced magnetic transition below H = 50 kG. It should be noted that the weak ferromagnetic moment, seen for both **H**[[100]] and **H**[[110]], does not appear for **H**[[001]]. Within the basal plane, the anisotropy between M100 and M110 is most pronounced for H above the first metamagnetic transition at ~11 kG. Whereas two metamagnetic transitions are found for **H**[[110]] near H = 16.5 and 23 kG, there are three possible transitions evident for **H**[[100]]. The significant hysteresis found for **H**[[100]] upon increasing and decreasing H, as shown by the arrows in Fig. 6, makes it difficult to resolve the nature or number of magnetic phases for H between 12 and 22 kG. The in-plane anisotropy of the saturated magnetic moment for TbNi2B2C is qualitatively similar to that found for HoNi2B2C, which is interpreted in terms of anisotropy due to CEF interaction,[12] although in the case of HoNi2B2C M110>_M_100 at 50 kG and 2 K. In the highest field (50 kG), the saturated paramagnetic moment of ~6.6_m_B for **H**[[110]] is significantly lower than the value of ~9.5_m_B for **H**[[100]]. It should be noted that the M100~9.5_m_B at 2 K and 50 kG is significantly larger than the saturation moment of 9.0_m_B for isolated Tb +3. We speculate that the value of M100~9.5_m_B (larger by 5.5% than 9.0_m_B) comes from the ferromagnetic polarization of conduction-electron spins due to the exchange interaction between the local magnetic moments and conduction-electron spins. However, the estimated _m_eff(~9.8_m_B) for the powder average is the same, within experimental error, as the theoretical _m_eff value (9.72_m_B) of the Tb +3 Hund's rule ground state. More studies will be necessary to clarify the reason for this difference.

Figure 7 shows field-induced magnetic transitions below H = 50 kG with **H**[[110]] at four different temperatures. At 2 K, there are two phase transitions near H = 16.5 and 23 kG in addition to the weak ferromagnetic component in the low-field region as seen in Fig. 5. Thus, a metamagnetic state exists between 16.5 and 23 kG and a saturated paramagnetic state exists at higher fields. At H = 50 kG the saturated magnetic moment of Tb +3 is 6.6_m_B, which is 73% of the theoretical maximum magnetization of 9_m_B. As the temperature increases, the first transition fades away and only one transition above H = 20 kG remains at T = 10 K and no WF component is detected at T = 10 K. At T = 300 K only a paramagnetic linear behavior of the magnetization versus field is seen.

## Discussion

Single crystals of _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) show large anisotropy in the normal-state magnetization that is attributed to crystalline electric-field (CEF) effects.[4-7] In a similar manner the magnetic anisotropy in TbNi2B2C found here is also attributed to CEF effects. For the tetragonal point symmetry (4/_mmm_) of an R ion in the _R_Ni2B2C compounds, the CEF Hamiltonian can be written as[42]

\[{\cal H}_{\rm CEF} = B_{2}^{0}O_{2}^{0} + B_{4}^{0}O_{4}^{0} + B_{4}^{4}O_{4}^{4} + B_{6}^{0}O_{6}^{0} + B_{6}^{4}O_{6}^{4},\]

  where the O_{n}^{m} are the Stevens equivalent operators and the B_{2}^{m} are the Stevens coefficients. The B_{2}^{0}O_{2}^{0} term in \mathcal{H}_{\rm CEF} is dominant in many cases and the field direction in which the susceptibility is largest is generally determined by the sign of B_{2}^{0}: _a_B_{2}^{0}>0 yields M_{ab}>M_{c}. Wang[15] and Boutron[16] showed that only the O_{2}^{0} term among the terms in the CEF Hamiltonian contributes to the high-T Weiss temperatures in single crystals with R in tetragonal point symmetry. From the expansion of the susceptibility \chi(T) as a power series in 1/T, the value of B_{2}^{0} can be calculated from the difference between \theta_{z} and \theta_{x,y} using the relation[16]

\[B_{2}^{0} = \frac{10}{3(2J-1)(2J+3)}(\theta_{x,y}-\theta_{z}),\]

where J is the angular momentum of the isolated ion, z is along the c axis, and x,y are, respectively, along the a and b axes of the tetragonal structure. Equation (2) is derived based on the assumption of uncoupled ions, i.e., no exchange interaction between rare-earth ions. By using the values of \theta_{z} and \theta_{x,y} found above from Fig. 1(b), B_{2}^{0} is estimated to be (1.54 \pm 0.04) K, the sign of which is consistent with the observed sign of the magnetization anisotropy. The positive sign of B_{2}^{0} is also consistent with the sign of B_{2}^{0} for other RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds[4, 5, 12] and the theoretical expectation of the point-charge model of CEF.

In the point-charge model, B_{2}^{0} can be written as

\[B_{2}^{0} = \langle r^{2}\rangle A_{2}^{0}\alpha_{J},\]

where \langle r^{2}\rangle is the mean-square radius of the 4f electrons, A_{2}^{0} represents the electrostatic effects from the static charges of the lattice of neighboring ions, and \alpha_{J} is the Stevens multiplicative factor. Assuming that A_{2}^{0} has a sign independent of particular rare-earth element among an isostructural series of compounds, and since the radial integral is positive by definition, the sign of B_{2}^{0} depends only on the sign of \alpha_{J}, which is negative for Tb ^{+ 3}[17]. This gives nice agreement with the observed sign of B_{2}^{0} of TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, assuming A_{2}^{0} is negative, as shown in Table 1. The values of \langle r^{2}\rangle normalized to the value of \langle r^{2}\rangle for Ho ^{+ 3} (Ref. [18]), and the \alpha_{J} values, normalized to the \alpha_{J} for Ho ^{+ 3}, are also listed. Assuming that A_{2}^{0} is constant within the RNi_{2}B_{2}C series, the theoretical and experimental estimations of B_{2}^{0}, both normalized to the Ho ^{+ 3} values, are also presented for comparison. Within the experimental error the point-charge CEF model predicts the sign of B_{2}^{0} correctly, according to the easy axis as observed in magnetization[4, 5, 6, 7] and neutron-diffraction[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] measurements. However, the normalized experimental magnitudes of B_{2}^{0} do not seem to be in such good agreement with the theoretical predictions. This discrepancy may come from the assumptions that A_{2}^{0} is constant through the RNi_{2}B_{2}C series and that the point-charge model applies, or may be due to the isolated ion assumption we have made in using Eq. (2).

For 8 K \llT\ll 14.9 K, TbNi_{2}B_{2}C is ordered antiferromagnetically in low applied magnetic field. The magnetization data shown in Fig. 1 are similar to those for the RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R = Er, Ho, Dy) (Refs. [5] and [7]) compounds below their magnetic ordering temperatures. However, as has been found in neutron-diffraction studies,[19, 20, 21, 22, 23] the R = Er, Ho, and Dy compounds each have different magnetic structures at low temperatures. Other than our inference that the ordered moment will be oriented near to or in the basal plane of the tetragonal structure, the details of the magnetic structure of TbNi_{2}B_{2}C must await the results of neutron-diffraction or magnetic x-ray-diffraction studies. The data shown in Figs. 3-5 indicate the existence of magnetic order with a weak ferromagnetic (WF) component below T\approx 8 K at low fields. [See noted added.] The weak ferromagnetism seems to be an intrinsic feature of the TbNi_{2}B_{2}C ground state. The anisotropy of the WF state shown in Fig. 6 rules out the possibility of the WF coming from a polycrystalline impurity phase, and the feature being seen in both the magnetization and the electrical resistivity data near 8 K is consistent with a bulk WF transition. This weak ferromagnetism in low field is, so far, peculiar to TbNi_{2}B_{2}C among the RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R = Gd-Tm) series and makes this compound of special interest.

Dzialoshinskii[25] showed that a WF state is possible in the space group D_{4h}^{14} (P4_{2}/mmn) of NiF_{2}, where the Ni has the same point symmetry that Tb ^{+ 3} has in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C. By minimizing the thermodynamic potential consistent with the crystal symmetry, he suggests five possible antiferromagnetic states, out of which four states can show a canted magnetic moment. Two of these four states have the AF components of the ordered moments \perp_{c}, and two \parallel**c**. In the former case, the canted moment can be either \parallel[100] or \parallel[110]. From Fig. 1, the Tb ^{+ 3} moments have an easy (_ab_) plane. Thus, two different canted AF magnetic states can be stabilized in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, corresponding to the AF components of the staggered moments lying along [100] or along [110]. It should be

  noted that the easy magnetization axis within the basal plane is along [100] in TbNi_{1}B_{2}C (see Fig. 6) rather than [110] as in (Ho,Dy)Ni_{2}B_{2}C [12, 26] which show no WF transition. We therefore speculate that the easy magnetization direction of [100] in TbNi_{1}B_{2}C may have a close relation with the occurrence of the WF state. Moriya [27, 28] developed the microscopic theory of weak ferromagnetism based on Dzialoshinskii's phenomenological model. He showed that the CEF effects together with spin-orbit coupling lead to a WF moment in NiF_{2} (T_{N}\sim 7.3 K), [27] and that the antisymmetric anisotropic superexchange interaction (the so-called Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction) appears to be the origin of weak ferromagnetism in \alpha-Fe_{2}O_{3} (T_{N}\approx 950 K). [28] We speculate that the former mechanism is likely to be responsible for the observed weak ferromagnetism in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C because the later mechanism is likely to be more important for antiferromagnetic materials with high Neel temperature, for then the exchange interaction is large. [28]

Recently the onset of superconductivity in single-crystal DyNi_{2}B_{2}C was found [7] (T_{c} = 6.2 K) below the long-range AF ordering temperature (T_{N}= 10.3 K). Given that T_{N}>T_{c} in DyNi_{2}B_{2}C, the possibility of superconductivity in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C (T_{N}= 14.9 K) should be examined. In fact, if one extrapolates the line for T_{c} (DG) between the Lu and Dy members to the DG factor of Tb^{+}^{3}, one obtains the predicted T_{c}\approx 1.2 K for TbNi_{2}B_{2}C (which is below the low-temperature limit of 2 K of the measurements of TbNi_{2}B_{2}C up to now). On the other hand, it is worthwhile to notice that the saturated magnetization at high magnetic field and low temperature is higher than the theoretical maximum magnetization (see Fig. 6) whereas the single crystal (Dy,Ho,Er)Ni_{2}B_{2}C shows a saturated magnetization close to or slightly lower than the theoretical maximum magnetization. [5, 12, 26] This may be due to different sign of I from that found for (Er,Ho,Dy)Ni_{2}B_{2}C, which may be relevant to determining T_{c}. In addition, the WF moments developing below \approx 8 K at zero magnetic field will be detrimental to superconductivity. The calculated 4 \pi M\approx 900 G from the WF moments is comparable with the thermodynamic critical fields (H_{c}) of the superconducting RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds. For example, the H_{c} of TNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [29]) single crystal was shown to be near 2.5 kG at 2K and the H_{c} of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [5]) single crystal can be estimated to be near 1.2 kG from the relation H_{c} = H_{c2}\sqrt{2}\kappa here H_{c2} is the upper critical field and \kappa is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter.

It is worthwhile to mention here that while single-crystal ErNi_{2}B_{2}C exhibits field-induced magnetic transitions at T = 2 K similar to the two transitions in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C near H = 16.5 and 22 kG in Fig. 7, two additional weak field-induced transitions at T = 2 K for H\approx 1 and 7 kG of unknown origin were reported in our previous paper (Ref. [5]). With the present clear evidence of a WF state in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, we suspect that the transition near H\approx 1 kG in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C may be related to a WF state. In that case the WF magnetization adds to, and is masked by, that of the superconducting diamagnetism, so that it is difficult to identify the WF state from magnetization measurements. Thus it will be of great interest to further investigate the coexistence of a possible WF state with superconductivity in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C.

Based upon M(T) data as in Fig. 3 and M(H) isotherms such as in Figs. 6 and 7, the H-T magnetic phase diagram of TbNi_{1}B_{2}C was studied and the results for \mathbf{H}\parallel[110] are plotted in Fig. 8. The squares are the magnetic transition fields defined as the fields of maximum slope of M versus H isotherm data. The data similarly derived from M vs T measurements at fixed H (circles) agree well with the data from the M vs H isotherms in the overlapping region. In zero field, the T_{N} from \rho_{ab} vs T in Fig. 2 is also plotted as a triangle. The upper phase boundary (which starts at T_{N}= 14.9 K in low field and saturates at 24 kG for temperatures below 5 K) represents the boundary between paramagnetism (higher temperature and fields) and magnetic order (lower temperatures and fields). The inner phase boundary divides the weakly ferromagnetic state (the lowest temperature and field state) from an unknown type of magnetically ordered state labeled "intermediate ordered state." This intermediate region of the phase digram may contain more than one type of magnetic order. Temperature and field-dependent neutron diffraction will help refine our understanding of this region.

In addition to the H-T phase digram shown in Fig. 8 for \mathbf{H}\parallel[110], we have some qualitative understanding of the features of the H-T phase diagram for \mathbf{H}\parallel[100]. For \mathbf{H}\parallel[100] the outer phase boundary is identical with that for \mathbf{H}\parallel[110], to within our precision. The inner phase boundary is more difficult to determine due to the hysteresis in M(H) seen in Fig. 6. If we focus on the nonhysteretic features, the lower phase boundary that delineates the WF region saturates at a lower field (H\approx 12 kG instead of H\approx 16 kG for \mathbf{H}\parallel[110]). On the other hand, there may be an extra phase boundary between H\approx 12 and H\approx 24 kG. Due to the

  hysteresis in the _M_(_H_) isotherms, details associated with this intermediate _H_-_T_ region will require further measurements.

## Conclusion

We have performed extensive magnetization measurements on single-crystal TbNi_{2}B_{2}C as well as measurements of \rho_{ab}(T). We find the onset of antiferromagnetic order at T_{N} = 14.9 K in low fields (_H_ <= 100 G), followed by the onset of a weakly ferromagnetic phase for T <= 8 K. No superconductivity is detected in either magnetization or resistivity measurements for T > 2 K. This lack of superconductivity may be due to the enhanced pairbreaking of the Tb +3 ion as predicted by de Gennes scaling, and/or it may be associated with the weak ferromagnetism present below 8 K.

TbNi_{2}B_{2}C has a highly anisotropic magnetization both above and below T_{N} ~ 14.9 K with M001 being lower than M100 and M110 at all measured temperatures and fields. Below 14.9 K there is an anisotropy between M100 and M110, particularly for H above the critical field(s) associated with the transition from the low-field ordered state to the intermediate-field ordered state. The high-field saturated moment is larger for **H**\left[ 100\right]\left( \right.\sim 9.5\mu_{B}) than for **H**\left[ 110\right]\left( \right.\sim 6.6\mu_{B}). This anisotropy is opposite to that found for HoNi_{2}B_{2}C and may be related to the existence of the WF phase.

Note added: Temperature-dependent neutron-scattering measurements have recently been completed on TbNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals in zero applied magnetic field.[30] These measurements show that the Tb sublattice is disordered for temperatures above 15 K, ordered in an incommensurate, modulated antiferromagnetic structure for temperatures below 15 K, and develops a ferromagnetic component for temperatures below 8 K.

###### Abstract

The anisotropic magnetization _M_(_T_) of single-crystal TbNi2B2C is reported as a function of applied magnetic field (**H**) for temperatures T from 2 to 300 K and with **H** parallel and perpendicular to the c axis (**H**[**c** and **H**L**_c_). In low field (_H_ <= 100 G) TbNi2B2C orders antiferromagnetically at Neel temperature T_{N} = (14.9 +- 0.1) K. Weak ferromagnetic (WF) behavior is found for T <= 8 K and H <= 10 kG. Both phase transitions are also detected in zero-field in-plane resistivity r_{b}(_T_) measurements. In contrast, previous low-field _M_(_T_,_H_) data showed antiferromagnetic ground states for (Gd,DyHo,Er,Tm)Ni2B2C crystals. The origin of the WF ordering, given the point symmetry (4/_mmm_) of the Tb + 3 ions, is addressed together with the observed in-plane anisotropy in the high-field magnetization. Possible reasons for the absence of superconductivity above 2 K in TbNi2B2C are also discussed. Finally, a partial _H_-_T_ magnetic phase diagram of TbNi2B2C is presented for **H**[[110] and aspects of the similar _H_-_T_ diagram for **H**[[100] are discussed.

## Introduction

The _R_Ni2B2C series of compounds exhibits a wide variety of low-temperature (_T_) ground states ranging from superconductivity (_R_ = Lu, Sc, Y, Th), to superconductivity coexisting with magnetic order (_R_ = Tm, Er, Ho, and Dy), to magnetic order without superconductivity (_R_ = Gd).1-7 These compounds crystallize in a layered crystal structure, which consists of the body-centered-tetragonal (bct) TbCr2Si2 structure with additional carbon atoms in each R layer.8 Theoretically these compounds are expected to show electronically three-dimensional behavior and conventional BCS-type superconductivity.9 Experimentally the R = Tm, Er, Ho compounds undergo antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the superconducting state and display an interplay between the magnetic ordering and the superconductivity in resistivity measurements of polycrystalline samples.2 Moreover, single crystals of each compound containing magnetic R atoms possess highly anisotropic normal-state magnetizations and also anisotropic and suppressed superconducting state properties, indicating the existence of significant interactions between the local magnetic moments and the superconducting electrons.4-6 More recently the discovery of superconductivity at T_{m}  6 K in single-crystal and polycrystalline DyNi2B2C below the AF ordering temperature T_{N}  10.3 K provided a rare example of superconductivity evolving out of an AF ground state.7 GdNi2B2C, on the other hand, does not become superconducting for T > 2 K.2,10 even though it orders antiferromagnetically below 20 K.10 Thus, with GdNi2B2C and DyNi2B2C as neighboring compounds, it is interesting to study the electronic and magnetic properties of single-crystal TbNi2B2C, which does not show any indication of superconductivity above 2 K in polycrystalline form.2

In this report, we present electronic transport and static magnetization (_M_) data of single-crystal TbNi2B2C. It is found that in addition to similarities with the R = Dy, Tm, Er, and Ho compounds, a new feature, a weak ferromagnetic (WF) component, develops at T  9 K, below T_{N} = 14.9 K, and at low ( <= 10 kG) magnetic fields H. We will discuss the magnetic anisotropy in the normal state in terms of crystalline electric-field (CEF) effects and the possible origin of WF together with the in-plane magnetization anisotropy of TbNi2B2C. We will also discuss possible reasons for the lack of superconductivity in TbNi2B2C based on the measured data.

## Experimental details

Crystals of TbNi2B2C were grown by the Ames Lab Ni2B flux method.5,11 This method yields plates of TbNi2B2C with masses up to 300 mg with the crystallographic _c_-axis perpendicular to the plate surface. Powder x-ray-diffraction patterns of crushed single crystals show the crystals to be single phase. The three crystallographic axes ([100], [110], and [001]) were determined by Laue x-ray diffraction for the crystal which was used for magnetization measurements. _M_(_H_,_T_) data were measured using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. A Linear Research Inc. LR400 four-wire ac resistance bridge was used in conjunction with the T and H environmental control of the SQUID magnetometer to measure in-plane four-probe resistivity as a function of temperature.

## Results

Figure 1(a) shows _M_(_T_)/_H_ of single-crystal TbNi2B2C for **H**[[001] (_M_001) and **H**[[100] (_M_100) with H = 10 kG. Figure 1(b) shows inverse _M_(_T_)/_H_ data together with a calculated powder averaged curve \left[ {(2M_{100} + M_{001})/3H} \right]^{- 1}. The magnetization data are highly anisotropic, with a larger magnetization for **H**[[100] than for **H**][[001]. The inverse _M_(_T_)/_H_ data for both field orientations in Fig. 1(b) show nearly linear behaviors above ~100 K and deviate from the linear behaviors below 100 K for both directions of **H**. The inverse _M_(_T_)/_H_ of the powder average reveals a linear behavior for the whole temperature range above 15 K, concealing (averaging) the deviations observed for **H**[**c** and **H**L** below ~100 K. Similar effects have already been seen in other _R_Ni_{2}B_{2}C (_R_ = Tm, Er, and Ho) single crystals.4-6 The data above 100 K are fit to the Curie-Weiss law _M_/_H_ = _C_/(_T_ - _th_), where the Curie constant C = _N_m_  T_{N} value, defined as the temperature of maximum d(MT)/HdT, decreases from 14.95 K at H = 1 kG to 10.5 K at 20 kG, which is similar to T_{N}(H) of single-crystal (Ho, Er)Ni2B2C.[5, 6] Above 25 kG, the AF ordering disappears and the magnetization saturates below 5 K to between 8.2_m__B_ and 8.7_m__B_, depending on the applied field. These data indicate that a field-induced magnetic phase transition occurs for 20 kG \leq_H_ \leq25 kG below 10 K. The phase transition observed in magnetization data in Fig. 1 and in the transport measurement in Fig. 2 near T = 8 K is observed for H = 1 kG as an increase of magnetization below 9 K, with M \approx 0.4_m__B_ at 2 K, indicating that a weak ferromagnetic (WF) component may develop out of the antiferromagnetic state for small applied magnetic fields. Above 10 kG, the feature near 8 K seems not to exist anymore indicating the possibility of a second magnetic phase transition.

In order to further understand the low-temperature and low-field region, we obtained _M_(_T_) data with H = 100 G and _M_(_H_) data at T = 2 K which are plotted in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. In Fig. 4, in addition to the AF transition at _T__N_^{\infty}15 K, the WF component is seen to develop below \approx 9 K and saturates below \approx 4 K. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization shows a lower saturation value at 2 K (0.22 m_{B}) and higher onset temperature (\approx 9 K) of the weak ferromagnetism than the field-cooling (FC) magnetization (0.25_m__B_ and \approx 8 K, respectively). Figure 5 shows a magnetic isotherm at 2 K. Whereas there is a hysteresis between the virgin curve 1 and the magnetization for field ramping down (curve 2), no noticeable hysteresis is found in the subsequent field sweeps indicated with arrows and numbers in Fig. 5. Extrapolating the higher field (500-1000 G) linear regions to zero field gives a saturated WF moment of 0.5_m__B_.

To investigate the low-temperature magnetization anisotropy of the crystal, field-dependent magnetization measurements were performed at 2 K with the field applied in three different crystallographic directions, i.e., **H**\left[ 100\right], [110], and [001], and the results are plotted in Fig. 6. There are large anisotropies between all three orientations, i.e., not only between **H**\left[ 100\right] and **H**\left[ 001\right] but also within the _ab_ plane, between **H**\left[ 100\right] and **H**\left[ 110\right]. M001 is smaller than

  both M100 and M110 and shows no field-induced magnetic transition below H = 50 kG. It should be noted that the weak ferromagnetic moment, seen for both **H**[[100]] and **H**[[110]], does not appear for **H**[[001]]. Within the basal plane, the anisotropy between M100 and M110 is most pronounced for H above the first metamagnetic transition at ~11 kG. Whereas two metamagnetic transitions are found for **H**[[110]] near H = 16.5 and 23 kG, there are three possible transitions evident for **H**[[100]]. The significant hysteresis found for **H**[[100]] upon increasing and decreasing H, as shown by the arrows in Fig. 6, makes it difficult to resolve the nature or number of magnetic phases for H between 12 and 22 kG. The in-plane anisotropy of the saturated magnetic moment for TbNi2B2C is qualitatively similar to that found for HoNi2B2C, which is interpreted in terms of anisotropy due to CEF interaction,[12] although in the case of HoNi2B2C M110>_M_100 at 50 kG and 2 K. In the highest field (50 kG), the saturated paramagnetic moment of ~6.6_m_B for **H**[[110]] is significantly lower than the value of ~9.5_m_B for **H**[[100]]. It should be noted that the M100~9.5_m_B at 2 K and 50 kG is significantly larger than the saturation moment of 9.0_m_B for isolated Tb +3. We speculate that the value of M100~9.5_m_B (larger by 5.5% than 9.0_m_B) comes from the ferromagnetic polarization of conduction-electron spins due to the exchange interaction between the local magnetic moments and conduction-electron spins. However, the estimated _m_eff(~9.8_m_B) for the powder average is the same, within experimental error, as the theoretical _m_eff value (9.72_m_B) of the Tb +3 Hund's rule ground state. More studies will be necessary to clarify the reason for this difference.

Figure 7 shows field-induced magnetic transitions below H = 50 kG with **H**[[110]] at four different temperatures. At 2 K, there are two phase transitions near H = 16.5 and 23 kG in addition to the weak ferromagnetic component in the low-field region as seen in Fig. 5. Thus, a metamagnetic state exists between 16.5 and 23 kG and a saturated paramagnetic state exists at higher fields. At H = 50 kG the saturated magnetic moment of Tb +3 is 6.6_m_B, which is 73% of the theoretical maximum magnetization of 9_m_B. As the temperature increases, the first transition fades away and only one transition above H = 20 kG remains at T = 10 K and no WF component is detected at T = 10 K. At T = 300 K only a paramagnetic linear behavior of the magnetization versus field is seen.

## Discussion

Single crystals of _R_Ni2B2C (_R_ = Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm) show large anisotropy in the normal-state magnetization that is attributed to crystalline electric-field (CEF) effects.[4-7] In a similar manner the magnetic anisotropy in TbNi2B2C found here is also attributed to CEF effects. For the tetragonal point symmetry (4/_mmm_) of an R ion in the _R_Ni2B2C compounds, the CEF Hamiltonian can be written as[42]

\[{\cal H}_{\rm CEF} = B_{2}^{0}O_{2}^{0} + B_{4}^{0}O_{4}^{0} + B_{4}^{4}O_{4}^{4} + B_{6}^{0}O_{6}^{0} + B_{6}^{4}O_{6}^{4},\]

  where the O_{n}^{m} are the Stevens equivalent operators and the B_{2}^{m} are the Stevens coefficients. The B_{2}^{0}O_{2}^{0} term in \mathcal{H}_{\rm CEF} is dominant in many cases and the field direction in which the susceptibility is largest is generally determined by the sign of B_{2}^{0}: _a_B_{2}^{0}>0 yields M_{ab}>M_{c}. Wang[15] and Boutron[16] showed that only the O_{2}^{0} term among the terms in the CEF Hamiltonian contributes to the high-T Weiss temperatures in single crystals with R in tetragonal point symmetry. From the expansion of the susceptibility \chi(T) as a power series in 1/T, the value of B_{2}^{0} can be calculated from the difference between \theta_{z} and \theta_{x,y} using the relation[16]

\[B_{2}^{0} = \frac{10}{3(2J-1)(2J+3)}(\theta_{x,y}-\theta_{z}),\]

where J is the angular momentum of the isolated ion, z is along the c axis, and x,y are, respectively, along the a and b axes of the tetragonal structure. Equation (2) is derived based on the assumption of uncoupled ions, i.e., no exchange interaction between rare-earth ions. By using the values of \theta_{z} and \theta_{x,y} found above from Fig. 1(b), B_{2}^{0} is estimated to be (1.54 \pm 0.04) K, the sign of which is consistent with the observed sign of the magnetization anisotropy. The positive sign of B_{2}^{0} is also consistent with the sign of B_{2}^{0} for other RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds[4, 5, 12] and the theoretical expectation of the point-charge model of CEF.

In the point-charge model, B_{2}^{0} can be written as

\[B_{2}^{0} = \langle r^{2}\rangle A_{2}^{0}\alpha_{J},\]

where \langle r^{2}\rangle is the mean-square radius of the 4f electrons, A_{2}^{0} represents the electrostatic effects from the static charges of the lattice of neighboring ions, and \alpha_{J} is the Stevens multiplicative factor. Assuming that A_{2}^{0} has a sign independent of particular rare-earth element among an isostructural series of compounds, and since the radial integral is positive by definition, the sign of B_{2}^{0} depends only on the sign of \alpha_{J}, which is negative for Tb ^{+ 3}[17]. This gives nice agreement with the observed sign of B_{2}^{0} of TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, assuming A_{2}^{0} is negative, as shown in Table 1. The values of \langle r^{2}\rangle normalized to the value of \langle r^{2}\rangle for Ho ^{+ 3} (Ref. [18]), and the \alpha_{J} values, normalized to the \alpha_{J} for Ho ^{+ 3}, are also listed. Assuming that A_{2}^{0} is constant within the RNi_{2}B_{2}C series, the theoretical and experimental estimations of B_{2}^{0}, both normalized to the Ho ^{+ 3} values, are also presented for comparison. Within the experimental error the point-charge CEF model predicts the sign of B_{2}^{0} correctly, according to the easy axis as observed in magnetization[4, 5, 6, 7] and neutron-diffraction[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] measurements. However, the normalized experimental magnitudes of B_{2}^{0} do not seem to be in such good agreement with the theoretical predictions. This discrepancy may come from the assumptions that A_{2}^{0} is constant through the RNi_{2}B_{2}C series and that the point-charge model applies, or may be due to the isolated ion assumption we have made in using Eq. (2).

For 8 K \llT\ll 14.9 K, TbNi_{2}B_{2}C is ordered antiferromagnetically in low applied magnetic field. The magnetization data shown in Fig. 1 are similar to those for the RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R = Er, Ho, Dy) (Refs. [5] and [7]) compounds below their magnetic ordering temperatures. However, as has been found in neutron-diffraction studies,[19, 20, 21, 22, 23] the R = Er, Ho, and Dy compounds each have different magnetic structures at low temperatures. Other than our inference that the ordered moment will be oriented near to or in the basal plane of the tetragonal structure, the details of the magnetic structure of TbNi_{2}B_{2}C must await the results of neutron-diffraction or magnetic x-ray-diffraction studies. The data shown in Figs. 3-5 indicate the existence of magnetic order with a weak ferromagnetic (WF) component below T\approx 8 K at low fields. [See noted added.] The weak ferromagnetism seems to be an intrinsic feature of the TbNi_{2}B_{2}C ground state. The anisotropy of the WF state shown in Fig. 6 rules out the possibility of the WF coming from a polycrystalline impurity phase, and the feature being seen in both the magnetization and the electrical resistivity data near 8 K is consistent with a bulk WF transition. This weak ferromagnetism in low field is, so far, peculiar to TbNi_{2}B_{2}C among the RNi_{2}B_{2}C (R = Gd-Tm) series and makes this compound of special interest.

Dzialoshinskii[25] showed that a WF state is possible in the space group D_{4h}^{14} (P4_{2}/mmn) of NiF_{2}, where the Ni has the same point symmetry that Tb ^{+ 3} has in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C. By minimizing the thermodynamic potential consistent with the crystal symmetry, he suggests five possible antiferromagnetic states, out of which four states can show a canted magnetic moment. Two of these four states have the AF components of the ordered moments \perp_{c}, and two \parallel**c**. In the former case, the canted moment can be either \parallel[100] or \parallel[110]. From Fig. 1, the Tb ^{+ 3} moments have an easy (_ab_) plane. Thus, two different canted AF magnetic states can be stabilized in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, corresponding to the AF components of the staggered moments lying along [100] or along [110]. It should be

  noted that the easy magnetization axis within the basal plane is along [100] in TbNi_{1}B_{2}C (see Fig. 6) rather than [110] as in (Ho,Dy)Ni_{2}B_{2}C [12, 26] which show no WF transition. We therefore speculate that the easy magnetization direction of [100] in TbNi_{1}B_{2}C may have a close relation with the occurrence of the WF state. Moriya [27, 28] developed the microscopic theory of weak ferromagnetism based on Dzialoshinskii's phenomenological model. He showed that the CEF effects together with spin-orbit coupling lead to a WF moment in NiF_{2} (T_{N}\sim 7.3 K), [27] and that the antisymmetric anisotropic superexchange interaction (the so-called Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction) appears to be the origin of weak ferromagnetism in \alpha-Fe_{2}O_{3} (T_{N}\approx 950 K). [28] We speculate that the former mechanism is likely to be responsible for the observed weak ferromagnetism in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C because the later mechanism is likely to be more important for antiferromagnetic materials with high Neel temperature, for then the exchange interaction is large. [28]

Recently the onset of superconductivity in single-crystal DyNi_{2}B_{2}C was found [7] (T_{c} = 6.2 K) below the long-range AF ordering temperature (T_{N}= 10.3 K). Given that T_{N}>T_{c} in DyNi_{2}B_{2}C, the possibility of superconductivity in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C (T_{N}= 14.9 K) should be examined. In fact, if one extrapolates the line for T_{c} (DG) between the Lu and Dy members to the DG factor of Tb^{+}^{3}, one obtains the predicted T_{c}\approx 1.2 K for TbNi_{2}B_{2}C (which is below the low-temperature limit of 2 K of the measurements of TbNi_{2}B_{2}C up to now). On the other hand, it is worthwhile to notice that the saturated magnetization at high magnetic field and low temperature is higher than the theoretical maximum magnetization (see Fig. 6) whereas the single crystal (Dy,Ho,Er)Ni_{2}B_{2}C shows a saturated magnetization close to or slightly lower than the theoretical maximum magnetization. [5, 12, 26] This may be due to different sign of I from that found for (Er,Ho,Dy)Ni_{2}B_{2}C, which may be relevant to determining T_{c}. In addition, the WF moments developing below \approx 8 K at zero magnetic field will be detrimental to superconductivity. The calculated 4 \pi M\approx 900 G from the WF moments is comparable with the thermodynamic critical fields (H_{c}) of the superconducting RNi_{2}B_{2}C compounds. For example, the H_{c} of TNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [29]) single crystal was shown to be near 2.5 kG at 2K and the H_{c} of ErNi_{2}B_{2}C (Ref. [5]) single crystal can be estimated to be near 1.2 kG from the relation H_{c} = H_{c2}\sqrt{2}\kappa here H_{c2} is the upper critical field and \kappa is the Ginzburg-Landau parameter.

It is worthwhile to mention here that while single-crystal ErNi_{2}B_{2}C exhibits field-induced magnetic transitions at T = 2 K similar to the two transitions in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C near H = 16.5 and 22 kG in Fig. 7, two additional weak field-induced transitions at T = 2 K for H\approx 1 and 7 kG of unknown origin were reported in our previous paper (Ref. [5]). With the present clear evidence of a WF state in TbNi_{2}B_{2}C, we suspect that the transition near H\approx 1 kG in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C may be related to a WF state. In that case the WF magnetization adds to, and is masked by, that of the superconducting diamagnetism, so that it is difficult to identify the WF state from magnetization measurements. Thus it will be of great interest to further investigate the coexistence of a possible WF state with superconductivity in ErNi_{2}B_{2}C.

Based upon M(T) data as in Fig. 3 and M(H) isotherms such as in Figs. 6 and 7, the H-T magnetic phase diagram of TbNi_{1}B_{2}C was studied and the results for \mathbf{H}\parallel[110] are plotted in Fig. 8. The squares are the magnetic transition fields defined as the fields of maximum slope of M versus H isotherm data. The data similarly derived from M vs T measurements at fixed H (circles) agree well with the data from the M vs H isotherms in the overlapping region. In zero field, the T_{N} from \rho_{ab} vs T in Fig. 2 is also plotted as a triangle. The upper phase boundary (which starts at T_{N}= 14.9 K in low field and saturates at 24 kG for temperatures below 5 K) represents the boundary between paramagnetism (higher temperature and fields) and magnetic order (lower temperatures and fields). The inner phase boundary divides the weakly ferromagnetic state (the lowest temperature and field state) from an unknown type of magnetically ordered state labeled "intermediate ordered state." This intermediate region of the phase digram may contain more than one type of magnetic order. Temperature and field-dependent neutron diffraction will help refine our understanding of this region.

In addition to the H-T phase digram shown in Fig. 8 for \mathbf{H}\parallel[110], we have some qualitative understanding of the features of the H-T phase diagram for \mathbf{H}\parallel[100]. For \mathbf{H}\parallel[100] the outer phase boundary is identical with that for \mathbf{H}\parallel[110], to within our precision. The inner phase boundary is more difficult to determine due to the hysteresis in M(H) seen in Fig. 6. If we focus on the nonhysteretic features, the lower phase boundary that delineates the WF region saturates at a lower field (H\approx 12 kG instead of H\approx 16 kG for \mathbf{H}\parallel[110]). On the other hand, there may be an extra phase boundary between H\approx 12 and H\approx 24 kG. Due to the

## Conclusion

We have performed extensive magnetization measurements on single-crystal TbNi_{2}B_{2}C as well as measurements of \rho_{ab}(T). We find the onset of antiferromagnetic order at T_{N} = 14.9 K in low fields (_H_ <= 100 G), followed by the onset of a weakly ferromagnetic phase for T <= 8 K. No superconductivity is detected in either magnetization or resistivity measurements for T > 2 K. This lack of superconductivity may be due to the enhanced pairbreaking of the Tb +3 ion as predicted by de Gennes scaling, and/or it may be associated with the weak ferromagnetism present below 8 K.

TbNi_{2}B_{2}C has a highly anisotropic magnetization both above and below T_{N} ~ 14.9 K with M001 being lower than M100 and M110 at all measured temperatures and fields. Below 14.9 K there is an anisotropy between M100 and M110, particularly for H above the critical field(s) associated with the transition from the low-field ordered state to the intermediate-field ordered state. The high-field saturated moment is larger for **H**\left[ 100\right]\left( \right.\sim 9.5\mu_{B}) than for **H**\left[ 110\right]\left( \right.\sim 6.6\mu_{B}). This anisotropy is opposite to that found for HoNi_{2}B_{2}C and may be related to the existence of the WF phase.

Note added: Temperature-dependent neutron-scattering measurements have recently been completed on TbNi_{2}B_{2}C single crystals in zero applied magnetic field.[30] These measurements show that the Tb sublattice is disordered for temperatures above 15 K, ordered in an incommensurate, modulated antiferromagnetic structure for temperatures below 15 K, and develops a ferromagnetic component for temperatures below 8 K.
