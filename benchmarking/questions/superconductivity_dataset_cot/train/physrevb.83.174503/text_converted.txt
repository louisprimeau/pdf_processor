###### Abstract

We report thermal transport properties of a K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂
superconducting single crystal. A peak anomaly in the thermal
conductivity is observed at nearly T_(C)/2, attributed to phonons. The
thermoelectric power above T_(c) exhibits nearly linear behavior and
could be described well by the carrier diffusion mechanism in a wide
temperature range. The zero-temperature extrapolated thermoelectric
power is smaller than the value in typical strongly correlated
superconductors, implying a large normalized Fermi temperature. These
findings indicate that K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ is a weakly or intermediately
correlated superconductor.

## I Introduction

The discovery of a superconducting transition temperature up to T_(c) =
26 K in LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (1111 type) with x∼ 0.11 (Ref. [1])
generated intense activity.[2, 3] Soon it was discovered that the
superconducting transition temperature can be pushed to higher values by
substituting La ions with heavier rare earths,[46] and the highest
T_(c)∼ 55 K was achieved in SmO_(1 − x)F_(x)FeAs (Ref. [7]) and ∼56.3 K
in Gd_(1 − x)Th_(x)FeAsO.[8] Superconductivity was also discovered in
doped AFe₂As₂ compounds (122 type, A = Ba, Sr, Ca) with ThCr₂Si₂
structure,[9, 10, 11] which contain a double FeAs plane, Fe₂As-type
AFeAs (111 type, A = Li or Na),[12, 13] as well as anti-PbO-type
Fe(Se,Te) (11 type).[14, 15] The pairing mechanism and order parameter
symmetry in new superconductors became important issues. s_(±)
superconductivity was proposed, in which the sign of the order parameter
is switched between the two sets of Fermi surfaces.[16, 17] A multiband
electronic structure and interpocket hopping or Fermi surface nesting
seemed to be common ingredients in all iron-based superconductors.[16,
17, 18] However, after more iron-based superconductors were observed,
consensus seems further away.[19, 20, 21, 22]

Recently, a new series of iron-based superconductors A_(x)Fe₂Se₂ (_A_ =
K,Rb,Cs,TI) has been discovered with relatively high T_(c)∼ 30 K.[23,
24, 25, 26, 27] These compounds are purely electron doped and it is
found that the superconductivity might occur in the proximity of a Mott
insulator.[25] The low-energy band structure and Fermi surface of
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ may be different from those of other iron-based
superconductors. Only electron pockets were observed in angle-resolved
photoemission experiments without a hole Fermi surface near the zone
center.[28, 29, 30] This indicates that the sign change and s_(±)-wave
pairing are not fundamental properties of iron-based superconductors.

Thermal transport measurement is an effective method to probe the
superconducting state and transport properties in the normal state in
high-T_(c) cuprates and iron-based superconductors.[31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37] In SmFeAsO_(0.85), the magnitude of the thermoelectric power
(TEP) develops a broad peak above T_(c) coupled with a metallic
resistivity behavior. This is attributed to resonant phonon scattering
between electron and hole pockets indicating a significant Fermi surface
nesting in this system.[32] The TEP in doped BaFe₂As₂ also pointed to a
significant modification of the Fermi surface at small electron doping,
stabilizing low-temperature superconductivity.[33] In the
Fe_(1 + y)Te_(1 − x)Se_(x) system, the TEP and Nernst coefficients
provide evidence of a low-density and strongly correlated
superconductor.[34] Finally, the thermal conductivity at very low
temperature provides insight into the superconducting gap structure.[19,
37]

Here we report temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent thermal
transport of a K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ single crystal. A peak in the thermal
conductivity [κ(T)] is observed at about $\frac{T_{c}}{2}$, which is
attributed to phonons. The thermoelectric power above T_(c) exhibits
nearly linear behavior and could be described well by the carrier
diffusion mechanism in a wide temperature range. The Fermi temperature
T_(F) deduced from these measurements yields a smaller T_(c)/T_(F) than
the value in the Fe_(1 + y)Te_(1 − x)Se_(x) system and other well-known
correlated superconductors, implying weaker electronic correlation.

## II Experiment

K_(0.65(3))Fe_(1.41(4))Se_(2.00(4)) (K-122) single crystals were
synthesized by the self-flux method as described elsewhere in
detail.[38] Thermal and electrical transport measurements were conducted
in a Quantum Design PPMS-9 physical properties measurement system. The
sample was cleaved to a rectangular shape with dimension 5 x 2 mm² in
the _ab_ plane and 0.3 μm thickness along the c axis. Thermoelectric
power and thermal conductivity were measured using the steady state
method and a one-heater-two-thermometer setup with silver paint contact
directly on the sample surface. The heat and electrical current were
transported within the _ab_ plane of the crystal oriented by a Laue
camera, with magnetic field along the c axis and perpendicular to the
heat/electrical current. The sample is very sensitive to oxygen in air,
and air exposure exceeding 1 h will result in significant surface
oxidization seen by an incomplete transition in ρ(T) and ρ > 0 below
T_(c). The exposure to air of samples we measured was less than 20 min.
The clear and complete superconducting transition seen in ρ(T) and S(T)
confirmed that the surface of our samples was not oxidized. The relative
error in our measurement for both κ and S was below 5

## III Results and Discussion

The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity ρ(T), thermal
conductivity κ(T), and TEP S(T) for K-122 in zero magnetic field between
2 and 130 K is shown in Fig. 1.

The ρ(T) is metallic below ∼125 K, and superconducting below ∼32 K.
These values are similar to those in previous reports [23; 24]. The
thermal conductivity decreases with decrease in temperature in general,
showing a peak below T_(c). The thermoelectric power is negative,
consistent with negative charge carriers. The TEP results for two
independently grown samples are nearly identical. The value of the TEP
decreases with decrease of temperature and exhibits nearly linear
behavior up to 130 K. It vanishes at T_(c) since Cooper pairs carry no
entropy. The T_(c) inferred from S(T) = 0 for two samples is identical
and is 31.8 K, consistent with resistivity measurement.

Figure 2(a) shows the thermal conductivity κ and electrical resistivity
ρ near T_(c). Below T_(c)κ increases with decrease in temperature and
peaks near $\frac{T}{2}$ (∼17 K). The peak in thermal conductivity below
T_(c) was observed in hole-doped Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂[39],
electron-doped Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(x))₂As₂[40], and other unconventional
superconductors such as YBa₂Cu₃O_(7 − δ) (Ref. [41]) and CeCoIn₅[42],
where it was attributed to a large quasiparticle (QP) population and
enhanced zero-field QP mean free path in the superconducting state.
However, the resistivity in our sample is very high. Thermal
conductivity is composed of an electron term κ_(e) and a phonon term
$\kappa_{\rm{ph}}$; $\kappa_{\rm{total}}=\kappa_{e}+\kappa_{\rm{ph}}$.
The electron term κ_(e) above T_(c), estimated using the Wiedemann-Franz
law $\frac{\kappa_{e}}{T}=\frac{L_{0}}{\rho}$, is very small and
indicates a predominantly phonon contribution [Fig. 1(b)]. In order to
clarify the origin of this peak, we show [Fig. 2(b)] the thermal
conductivity of K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂, which is a semiconductor with
identical crystal structure and somewhat reduced lattice parameters
[43]. K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)S₂ also exhibits a peak in thermal conductivity at
∼22 K that is obviously unrelated to T_(c). Moreover, a 9 T magnetic
field suppresses superconductivity in K-122 to 27 K [38; 44]. This
should suppress the peak in thermal conductivity induced by QPs, as seen
in cuprates and Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂[40; 41]. However, a 9 T magnetic
field has no significant influence on the peak observed in our sample,
as shown by the open circles in Fig. 2(a). The peak in κ therefore is
more likely to originate from phonons rather than the QP contribution.
The phonon peak in lattice thermal conductivity is commonly found in
materials due to the competition between the point-defect/boundary
scattering and the umklapp phonon scattering mechanism [45].

Figure 3 presents ρ(T) and S(T) near T_(c) in different magnetic fields
up to 9 T. The resistive transition strongly broadens, and both the
onset temperature and the zero resistance are suppressed. The
superconducting transition seen by TEP is also suppressed and broadened
by an external field but the amplitude of the normal state Seebeck
response does not change for μ₀H < 9 T. These features are reminiscent
of the thermally induced motion of vortex lattices in superconductors. A
small peak just above T_(c) in the TEP is observed only under zero
field, as shown by the red arrow in Fig. 3(b). This is similar to some
TEP observed in cuprates and is attributed to the ac measuring technique
[46; 47]. The ac measurement technique picks up a voltage contribution
of the thermoelectric power derivative in addition to the linear term.
This is present even for good thermal contacts and is reduced for a
lower density of data points and sharp transitions.

Figure 1: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the resistivity (a),

zero magnetic field within a temperature range from 2 to 130 K. The
electron term κ_(e) is estimated using the Wiedemann-Franz law and the
phonon term $\kappa_{\rm{ph}}$ is obtained by subtracting the electron
term from the total thermal conductivity (see text). We show the
thermoelectric power S(T) for two independently grown samples A and B.

$\rho=\rho_{0}\exp(-\frac{U_{a}(B)}{k_{B}T})$, where U_(a)(B) is the
activation energy for the flux motion. A linear behavior occurs over a
typical temperature interval of about 6 K. The Seebeck coefficient
follows identical temperature dependence in the same region. Figures
4(a) and 4(b) show the Arrhenius plots of ln(ρ) and ln(S) as a function
of the inverse temperature. The conventional theory cannot reproduce the
large TEP in the mixed state, similarly to the high-T_(c) cuprates.[48;
49] The activation energy for the flux motion obtained from resistivity
decreases exponentially with magnetic field, but the value obtained from
the TEP is nearly unchanged and larger, as shown in Fig. 4(c), also in
contrast to the conventional theory of flux motion.

TEP is associated with entropy and heat transport parallel to the
"induced" electric field. This longitudinal entropy flow is not carried
by the normal excitations in the vortex cores since these excitations
move with the vortices perpendicular to the induced electric field
(Nernst effect).[49] The longitudinal entropy transport has to be
attributed to other excitations. We postulate that TEP in the mixed
state near T_(c) is attributable to quasi-particles excited over the
energy gap as in high-T_(c) cuprates.[48; 49] Such excitations, not
bound to the vortex core, are present in any superconductor at finite
temperature and may be important in determining the dissipation due to
the short coherence length.[48; 49] Therefore, an estimate of the TEP
can be obtained from

$$\frac{S_{M}}{S_{N}}\simeq\frac{\rho_{M}}{\rho_{N}},$$
(1)

where S_(M), ρ_(M), S_(N), ρ_(N) are the TEP and resistivity in the
mixed (M) and normal states (N), respectively, since the TEP from
longitudinal entropy flow has a small dependence on the Hall angle.[49]
This is in a good agreement with experimental data, as shown in Fig.
4(d).

We now turn to the TEP in the normal state. TEP is the sum of three
different contributions: the diffusion term $S_{\rm diff}$, the
spin-dependent scattering term, and the phonon-drag term $S_{\rm drag}$
due to electron-phonon coupling.[32; 50] The spin-dependent scattering
or corresponding magnon drag effect always gives ∼T^(3/2)
dependence,[51] which is not observed in our TEP results. Moreover, TEP
in our sample above T_(c) is independent of magnetic field, which
excludes the spin-dependent mechanism. The contribution of the
phonon-drag term often gives ∼T³ dependence for T ≪ Θ_(D), ∼1/T for
T ≥ Θ_(D) (where Θ_(D) is the Debye temperature), and a peak structure
for $\sim\frac{\Theta_{D}}{5}$.[52; 53] The estimated Debye temperature
of the K-122 system is about 260 K.[54] The absence of the peak
structure in our TEP results suggests a negligible contribution of the
phonon-drag effect to S(T). Instead a nearly linear relationship is
observed between 2 and 120 K [Fig. 1(c)], suggesting that the diffusion
term is dominant.

The diffusive Seebeck response of a Fermi liquid is expected to be
linear in T in the zero-temperature limit, with a magnitude proportional
to the strength of electronic correlations.[55] This is similar to the
T-linear electronic specific heat, C_(e)/T = γ. Both can be linked to
the Fermi temperature T_(F):

$$S/T=\pm\frac{\pi^{2}}{2}\frac{k_{B}}{e}\frac{1}{T_{F}},$$

small peak position just above T_(c) in the TEP.

$$\gamma=\frac{\pi^{2}}{2}k_{B}\frac{n}{T_{F}},$$
(3)

where k_(B) is Boltzmann’s constant, e is the electron charge, and n is
the carrier density.[34] Figure 5 presents the temperature dependence of
the TEP divided by T, S/T, under 0 (open squares) and 9 T (open circles)
magnetic field for sample A and 0 T (closed squares) for sample B. TEP
in the normal state near T_(c) is independent of magnetic field and can
be described well by the diffusive model. The zero-temperature
extrapolated value of S/T is ∼0.48 μV/K for μ₀H < 9 T (Fig. 5). We can
therefore extract T_(F) = 880 K.

The ratio of the superconducting transition temperature to the
normalized Fermi temperature, $\frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}$, characterizes the
correlation strength in superconductors. In unconventional
superconductors, such as CeCoIn₈ (Ref. [56]) and YBa₂Cu₃O_(6.67),[57]
this ratio is about 0.1, but it is only ∼0.02 in BCS superconductors,
such as LuNi₂B₂C.[34] In Fe_(1 + γ)Te_(1 − γ)Se_(x),
$\frac{T_{c}}{T_{c}}$ is also near 0.1, pointing to the importance of
electronic correlations.[34] When compared to these strongly correlated
superconductors, $\frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}\sim 0.04$ in our crystal is
relatively small, but is larger than in conventional superconductors.
This implies that K-122 is a weakly or intermediately correlated
superconductor. K-122 is proposed to be an iron-based high-temperature
superconductor near insulating antiferromagnetic order, just like
cuprates, whose parent compound is a Mott insulator and where the
correlation effects dominate.[25] However, a transmission electron
microscope study demonstrated the presence of ordered Fe vacancies in
the ab plane[58] and a theoretical study pointed out that the ordered Fe
vacancies could induce band narrowing and consequently decrease the
correlation strength needed for the Mott transition.[59] This could
explain the relatively weak correlation strength observed in our
experiment.

Recent specific heat measurement[54] find γ_(u) = 6 ± 0.5 ml/mol K²,
which is smaller than in iron-based superconductors. The absolute value
of the dimensionless ratio of TEP to specific heat,
$q=\frac{N_{Au}eS}{T_{Y}}$, with N_(Av) the Avogadro number, provides
the carrier density.[55] Calculation gives the carrier density with
|q|⁻¹ ≃ 0.13 carriers per unit cell, which is somewhat larger than the
value in Fe_(1 + γ)Te_(0.6)Se_(0.4).[34] Given the volume of the unit
cell, we obtain the carrier density per volume n ≃ 6.1 × 10²⁰ cm⁻³ and
derive the Fermi momentum k_(F) = (3π²n)^(1/3) ≃ 2.6 nm⁻¹. Ultimately we
can derive the effective mass m^(*), Fermi velocity v_(F), and the
superconducting coherence length ξ using
$k_{B}T_{F}=\frac{\pi^{2}k_{F}^{2}}{2m^{*}}\hbar k_{F}=m^{*}v_{F}$, and
$\xi=\frac{\hbar v_{F}}{\pi\Delta_{0}}$ with Δ₀ = 10.3 meV measured by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.[28] The results are listed in
Table 1. It is worth noting that ξ can also be derived from the upper
critical field H_(c2), using
$H_{c2}(0)=0.693[-\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}]_{T_{c}}T_{c}$ and
$\xi^{-2}=\frac{2\pi}{\partial_{0}}\frac{H_{c2}(0)}{T_{c}}$. From Ref.
[24, $[-\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}]_{T_{c}}=3.17$ T/K, and the derived
superconducting coherence length is ξ ≃ 2.2 nm, consistent with value in
Table 1. This confirms the consistency of our derived parameters.

## IV Conclusion

Thermal transport measurement of the iron-based superconductor
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ have been performed on a single-crystalline sample.
The peak anomaly in thermal conductivity observed at nearly
$\frac{T_{c}}{2}\sim$ 17 K is attributed to the phonon contribution. The
large thermoelectric power in the mixed state could imply large
quasiparticle excitations over the energy gap. The thermoelectric power
above T_(c) exhibits nearly linear behavior and could be described well
by the carrier diffusion mechanism in a wide temperature range. The
zero-temperature extrapolated thermoelectric power is smaller when
compared to other correlated superconductors, pointing to a large
normalized Fermi temperature. These findings indicate that
K_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ is a weakly or intermediately correlated
superconductor. The ordered Fe vacancies could induce band narrowing and
then decrease the correlation strength needed for the Mott transition,
as predicted by theory.

_Note added._ We recently became aware of Ref. [60] with similar
thermopower data in zero field.
