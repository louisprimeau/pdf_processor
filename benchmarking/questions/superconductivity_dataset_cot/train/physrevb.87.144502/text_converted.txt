###### Abstract

The thermal conductivity of iron-based superconductor CsFe₂As₂ single
crystal (T_(c) = 1.81 K) was measured down to 50 mK. A significant
residual linear term κ₀/T = 1.27 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹ is observed in zero
magnetic field, which is about 1/10 of the normal-state value in upper
critical field H_(c2). In low magnetic field, κ₀/T increases rapidly
with field. The normalized κ₀/T(H) curve for our CsFe₂As₂ (with residual
resistivity ρ₀ = 1.80 μΩ cm) lies between the dirty KFe₂As₂ (with
ρ₀ = 3.32 μΩ cm) and the clean KFe₂As₂ (with ρ₀ = 0.21 μΩ cm), which is
consistent with its impurity level. These results strongly suggest a
nodal superconducting gap in CsFe₂As₂, similar to its sister compound
KFe₂As₂.

## I Introduction

For the iron-based superconductors,^(1, 2) one very important issue is
the symmetry and structure of their superconducting gap,³ which is
crucial for understanding the mechanism of high-temperature
superconductivity.⁴ However, after 5 years of extensive studies, it is
still a complex situation, mainly due to their multiple electronic
bands.^(5, 6)

Most of the iron-based superconductors have both hole and electron Fermi
surfaces, for example, Ba_(0.6)K_(0.4)Fe₂As₂.⁶ While many of these
superconductors show nodeless superconducting gaps, such as optimally
doped BaFe₂As₂,⁶ ⁻ ¹⁰ LiFeAs,¹¹ ⁻ ¹⁴ NaFe_(1 − x)Co_(x)As,^(15, 16) and
FeTe_(1 − x)Se_(x),^(17, 18) some of them manifest nodal superconducting
gap, such as BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x)),¹⁹ ⁻ ²¹ Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Ru_(x))₂As₂,²²
LiFeP,²³ and LaFePO.^(24, 25) So far, it is not conclusive that the
nodeless gaps on different Fermi surfaces are s_(±) wave.³ The nodal gap
in those isovalently P- or Ru-substituted compounds could be accidental
nodal s wave on some Fermi surface,²¹ but its origin is still not very
clear.²³

More intriguingly, while nodeless superconducting gaps were observed in
the extremely electron-doped A_(x)Fe_(2 − y)Se₂ (A = K, Rb, Cs, …) with
only electron pockets,^(26, 27 − 28) a nodal superconducting gap was
found in the extremely hole-doped KFe₂As₂ with only hole
pockets.^(29, 30) It is now under hot debate whether the superconducting
gap in KFe₂As₂ is d wave or accidental nodal s wave.³¹ ⁻ ³³ Thermal
conductivity measurements gave compelling evidence for a d-wave
gap,^(31, 32) but recent low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements showed octet-line node structure,
suggesting accidental nodal s-wave gap.³³

To clarify this situation in KFe₂As₂, it will be helpful to investigate
the superconducting gap structure of its two sister compounds RbFe₂As₂
and CsFe₂As₂, both with T_(c) = 2.6 K from the measurements of
polycrystalline samples.^(34, 35) Unexpectedly, recent muon-spin
spectroscopy measurements of RbFe₂As₂ polycrystal claimed that the
temperature dependence of the superfluid density n_(s) is best described
by a two-gap s-wave model,^(36, 37) which is quite different from
KFe₂As₂. In this context, more experiments are highly desired,
especially on the single crystals of RbFe₂As₂ and CsFe₂As₂.

In this paper we present the thermal conductivity measurements of
CsFe₂As₂ single crystals down to 50 mK. We find clear evidence for
superconducting gap nodes from the significant residual linear term κ₀/T
in zero field and the field dependence of κ₀/T. Our results suggest
common nodal gap structure in CsFe₂As₂ and KFe₂As₂.

## II Experiment

The CsFe₂As₂ single crystals were grown by self-flux method.³⁸ The
sample was cleaved to a rectangular shape of dimensions 3.5 x 1.0 mm² in
the ab plane, with 30 μm thickness along the c axis. Contacts were made
directly on the sample surfaces with silver paint, which were used for
both resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements. To avoid
degradation, the sample was exposed in air less than 2 h. The contacts
are metallic with typical resistance 100 mΩ at 2 K. In-plane thermal
conductivity was measured in a dilution refrigerator, using a standard
four-wire steady-state method with two RuO₂ chip thermometers,
calibrated _in situ_ against a reference RuO₂ thermometer. Magnetic
fields were applied along the c axis and perpendicular to the heat
current. To ensure a homogeneous field distribution in the sample, all
fields were applied at temperature above T_(c).

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1(a) shows the in-plane resistivity ρ(T) of a CsFe₂As₂ single
crystal. The shape of the ρ(T) curve mimics that of KFe₂As₂ single
crystal.^(29, 31) From the inset of Fig. 1(a), the T_(c) defined by
ρ = 0 is 1.81 K. For the CsFe₂As₂ polycrystal in Ref. ³⁴, the T_(c)
defined by the sharp drop of susceptibility is about 2.2 K.³⁴ The origin
of the 0.4 K difference between the T_(c) of CsFe₂As₂ single crystal and
polycrystal is not clear. One possible reason is that the polycrystal in
Ref. ³⁴ is purer than our single crystal since it has been shown that
for KFe₂As₂ the purer sample has higher T_(c).³¹ In any case, the T_(c)
of (K, Rb, Cs)Fe₂As₂ series (3.8, 2.6, and 1.8-2.2 K, respectively)
seems to decrease with the increase of the ionic radius of alkali metal.

In Fig. 1(b) the low-temperature resistivity is plotted as ρ vs T^(1.5).
It is found that ρ obeys T^(1.5) dependence nicely above T_(c), up to
about 9 K. The fit of the data between 2.6 and 9 K gives residual
resistivity ρ₀ = 1.80μΩ cm, thus the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) =
ρ(300 K)/ρ₀ ≈ 200 is obtained. For the dirty KFe₂As₂ single crystal with
ρ₀ = 3.32μΩ cm and RRR  ≈ 110, ρ ∼ T^(1.5) has already been noticed.[29]
For the clean KFe₂As₂ single crystal with ρ₀ = 0.21μΩ cm and RRR
 ≈ 1180, ρ ∼ T^(1.8) was found.[31] Such a non-Fermi-liquid behavior of
ρ(T) in KFe₂As₂ and CsFe₂As₂ may result from the antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations.[39] In BaFe₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂, the non-Fermi-liquid
linear behavior of ρ(T) near optimal doping, and the increase of power n
in the overdoped regime have been considered as the signature of a
quantum critical point.[40]

In order to estimate the upper critical field H_(c2)(0) of CsFe₂As₂, the
resistivity was also measured in magnetic fields up to H = 4 T, as shown
in Fig. 2(a). Figure 2(b) plots the temperature dependence of H_(c2)(T),
defined by ρ = 0. This definition usually corresponds to the bulk
H_(c2). From Fig. 2(b) we estimate H_(c2)(0 ≈ 1.4 T. To choose a
slightly different H_(c2) does not affect our discussion on the field
dependence of κ₀/T below.

The ultra-low-temperature heat transport measurement is a bulk technique
to probe the gap structure of superconductors.[41] In Fig. 3(a) we
present the temperature dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity for
CsFe₂As₂ single crystal in zero and applied magnetic fields, plotted as
κ/T vs T. All the curves are roughly linear, as previously observed in
dirty KFe₂As₂,[29] BaFe_(1.9)Ni_(0.1)As₂,[9] and
Ba(Fe_(1 − x)Ru_(x))₂As₂ single crystals.[22] Therefore we fit all the
curves to κ/T = a + bT^(α − 1) with α fixed to 2. The two terms aT and
bT^(α) represent contributions from electrons and phonons, respectively.
Here we only focus on the electronic term.

For CsFe₂As₂ in zero field, the fitting gives κ₀/T = a = 1.27 ± 0.04 mW
K⁻² cm⁻¹. This value is about 1/10 of the normal-state Wiedemann-Franz
law expectation κ_(N0)/T = L₀/ρ₀ = 13.6 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹, with L₀ the Lorenz
number 2.45 × 10⁻⁸ W Q K⁻² and normal-state ρ₀ = 1.80μΩ cm. For a
high-quality superconductor with no impure phase, such a significant
κ₀/T in zero field is usually contributed by nodal quasiparticles, thus
considered as strong evidence for nodes in the superconducting gap.[41]
For example, κ₀/T = 1.41 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹ for the overdoped cuprate
Tl₂Ba₂CuO_(6 + δ) (Tl-2201), a d-wave superconductor with T_(c) = 15
K.[42] Previously, κ₀/T = 2.27 and 3.6 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹ were observed for
dirty and clean KFe₂As₂, respectively.[29; 31]

For the clean KFe₂As₂, an additional large electronic term κ/T ∼ T² was
also observed.[31] Reid etal. considered this term as the leading-order
finite-temperature correction to κ/T for d-wave superconductor, which
will be rapidly suppressed by impurity scattering and magnetic
field.[31] From Fig. 3(a),

Figure 2: (Color online) (a) Low-temperature resistivity of CsFe₂As₂
single crystal in magnetic field up to 4 T. (b) Temperature dependence
of the upper critical field H_(c2)(T), defined by ρ = 0. The dashed line
is a guide to the eye, which points to H_(c2)(0 ≈ 1.4 T.

crystal. The inset shows the resistive superconducting transition with
T_(c) = 1.81 K defined by ρ = 0. (b) Low-temperature resistivity plotted
as ρ vs T^(1.5). The solid line is a fit of the data between 2.6 and 9 K
to ρ = ρ₀ + AT^(1.5), which gives residual resistivity ρ₀ = 1.80μΩ cm.

such an electronic term is absent in our CsFe₂As₂ single crystal, which
is not very clean.

The field dependence of κ₀/T can provide further support for the gap
nodes.[41] For a nodal superconductor, κ₀/T increases rapidly in low
field due to the Volovik effect,[43] as in Tl-2201.[42] In contrast, for
a single-gap s-wave superconductor, κ₀/T displays a very slow field
dependence at low field, as in Nb.[44] In Fig. 3(b) we plot the field
dependence of κ₀/T for CsFe₂As₂. At low field, κ₀/T indeed increases
rapidly. Then it shows slight downward curvature before reaching the
upper critical field H_(c2)(0). In H = 1.5 T slightly above
H_(c2)(0) = 1.4 T, the fitting gives κ₀/T = 13.6 ± 0.3 mW K⁻² cm⁻¹,
satisfying the Wiedemann-Franz law perfectly.

For comparison, the normalized (κ₀/T)/(κ_(N0)/T) of CsFe₂As₂ is plotted
as a function of H/H_(c2) in Fig. 4, together with Nb,[44] Tl-2201,[42]
the dirty and clean KFe₂As₂.[29; 31] Clearly the curve of CsFe₂As₂ lies
between the dirty and clean KFe₂As₂. The dirty KFe₂As₂ shows similar
field dependence of κ₀/T to that of Tl-2201,[29] which should also be
dirty, with ρ₀ = 5.6μΩ cm and RRR  ≈ 30.[42] For the clean KFe₂As₂, Reid
_et al._ argued that the field dependence of κ₀/T is compelling evidence
for a d-wave gap since the experimental κ₀/T(H) curve is close to the
calculated curve of a d-wave superconductor in the clean limit
(ℏΓ/Δ₀ = 0.1).[31] The ρ₀ and RRR of our CsFe₂As₂ lie between the dirty
and clean KFe₂As₂, indicating that its impurity level lies between the
dirty and clean KFe₂As₂. This may reasonably explain the position and
shape of its normalized κ₀/T(H) curve in Fig. 4. Such a result suggests
that CsFe₂As₂ has a nodal superconducting gap structure similar to that
of KFe₂As₂, and shows how the field dependence of κ₀/T evolves with the
impurity level.

## IV Summary

In summary, we have measured the thermal conductivity of CsFe₂As₂ single
crystal, the sister compound of KFe₂As₂, down to 50 mK. Both the
significant κ₀/T in zero field and the field dependence of κ₀/T provide
clear evidence for nodal superconducting gap in CsFe₂As₂. Our results
suggest that the extremely hole-doped (K, Rb, Cs)Fe₂As₂ series of
iron-based superconductors should have a common nodal gap structure.
More experiments on these compounds are needed to get the consensus on
their exact gap symmetry (d wave or accidental nodal s wave).
