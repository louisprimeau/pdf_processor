 described elsewhere.[9] Due to the extreme moisture sensitivity of Na0.5Co02*1.3H2O it was necessary to contain the sample in a wet environment prior to loading in the diamond anvil cell. Furthermore, care was taken to minimize the exposure time to the atmosphere during loading. Initially a methanol:ethanol:water mixture of 16:3:1 by volume was used as a pressure-transmitting fluid to ensure hydrostaticity. However, we noticed a phase transition from the hexagonal to a monoclinic phase already at very low pressures (~0.15 GPa) (Fig. 3) as well as an initial increase of the \(a\) axis of the monoclinic cell. When changing the pressure-transmitting fluid to Fluorinert(tm) no phase transition or intercalation under pressure is observed. It is noteworthy that this intercalation affects the basal plane of the monoclinic distorted hexagonal unit cell and not the \(c\) axis. This could be related to an increase of the Na coordination number from six to seven within the charge reservoir as is frequently observed in Na-containing zeolites under conditions where pressure-induced hydration occurs.[10] The pressure on the sample was measured by detecting the shift of the \(R\)1 emission line of the included ruby chips.[11] In our experiments, no evidence of nonhydrostatic behavior or pressure anisotropy was detected, and the \(R\)1 peaks of 3 to 4 included ruby chips remained strong and sharp with deviations less than +-0.1 GPa. The hydrostatic limit for Fluorinert(tm) is generally quoted to be ca. 1.5 GPa,[12, 13] but others report extended hydrostaticity when the samples are softer than the glass that Fluorinert forms under pressure.[14] Fluorinert(tm) was also used in the determination of the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the superconducting transition temperature \(d\) ln _T_c/_dp_ by Lorenz _et al._[15] Bulk moduli were determined by fitting the normalized volumes to a second-order Birch-Muraghan equation of state[16] using a fixed pressure derivative of 4.

The derived bulk compressibilities of 43(2) GPa, 90(6) GPa, and 101(3) GPa for {_x_ = 0.3,\(y\) = 1.3}, {_x_ = 0.3,\(y\) = 0.6}, and {_x_ = 0.3,\(y\) = 0}, respectively, show the expected higher compressibility of the superconductor compared to the doped metal oxide {_x_ = 0.3,\(y\) = 0} as well as the intermediate {_x_ = 0.3,\(y\) = 0.6} oxyhydrate (Fig. 4). Lorenz _et al._[15] showed that _dT_c/_dp_ is negative and nonlinear up to 1.6 GPa. Interestingly enough \(d\) ln _T_c/_dp_~-0.07 GPa is, as was pointed out, similar to values observed in electron-doped cuprates.[15] Despite the low _T_c Na0.3CoO2*1.3H2O appears to behave according to the universal relationship[17] between \(d\) ln _T_c/_dp_ and _T_c established for high-_T_c_ superconductors. The structures show a very strong anisotropy under pressure: in all cases the \(c\) axis is the most compressible direction, whereas the \(a\) axes show only a marginal decrease with pressure (see Fig. 4 for details). However, when intercalating extra molecules under pressure (alcohols or water), the structure distorts and the former hexagonal basal plane expands slightly under pressure in both Na0.3CoO2*1.3H2O and Na0.3CoO2*0.6H2O. The bulk moduli of the monoclinic phases measured when using the methanol:ethanol:water mixture as the pressure-transmitting fluid are about 15-30 % higher than those obtained for the hexagonal phases using Fluorinert(tm) [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)]. This is in contrast to other observed framework structures altered by intercalation under pressure,[10, 14] The linear compressibilities along the CoO2 layers, however, indicate that the monoclinic phases are more compressible than the corresponding hexagonal phases [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)]. Full release of pressure and subsequent exposure of the Na0.3CoO2*1.3H2O sample to the laboratory humidity conditions (~25% relative humidity) resulted in a gradual deintercalation, and after 1 day of exposure to air a Na0.3CoO2*0.6H2O phase formed. We encourage repeating the measurements of the pressure dependence on _T_c using methanol:ethanol:water as the pressure-transmitting medium to probe if the observed monoclinic phase is also superconducting and to understand how the expansion of the (_a_,_b_) plane influences the electronic properties.

In summary, we have found an alternative environmentally benign synthesis route for the superconductors of the NaCoO2*.yH2O family (_x_~0.3). Furthermore, we have determined the intrinsic bulk compressibilities of Na0.3CoO2*1.3H2O, Na0.3CoO2*0.6H2O, and Na0.3CoO2. A monoclinic distortion of Na0.3CoO2*1.3H2O was found to occur at very low pressures when using an alcohol:water mixture as a pressure-transmitting fluid. Magnetic suscepti

  bility and resistivity measurements of this pressure-stabilized phase could provide valuable information about this fascinating new family of superconductors and its stability field.
