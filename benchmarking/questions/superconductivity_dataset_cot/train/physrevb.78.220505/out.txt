Our results show no hysteresis (hence no measurable heating) during the pulse, indicating a good thermal anchor was established with the bath. To determine the upper critical-field anisotropy the single crystal was measured in two orthogonal sample orientations: with the applied field parallel to the conducting planes [perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis (see inset of Fig. 1)] and with the applied field normal to the conducting planes [parallel to the crystallographic c axis (see inset of Fig. 2)]. Alignment accuracy was within approximately 2^{\circ}. For applied field perpendicular to the c axis (Fig. 1) the sample was placed in a circular detection coil (\approx0.8 mm in diameter). The sample and probe were cooled down to liquid-helium temperatures inside of a double-walled nonmetallic cryostat with \approx500 Torr of helium exchange gas. The onset of the superconducting transition is clearly observed (as a resonant frequency shift) near 32 K in zero applied magnetic field (shown in the inset of Fig. 3). In the second orientation (H parallel to the c axis) (Fig. 2) a flux-compensated "figure eight" detection coil set (0.7 mm diameter each) was placed with its symmetry axis parallel to the applied magnetic field. The compensated nature of the detection coil was necessary to minimize induced voltages feeding back into the rf IC. The sample was placed on the top surface of one side of the counterwound coil pair. This configuration has weaker coupling to the sample (<50%), resulting in a smaller but still easily resolvable frequency shift. The temperature was stabilized with a conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) temperature controller with an accuracy of \approx\pm 0.1 K.

The criterion for determining the point at which the H_{c2} transition occurs requires consistency, and no one method is entirely unambiguous. However, the rf penetration depth technique has demonstrated a high degree of agreement with accepted thermodynamic methods [9] and as a "contactless" method avoids problems with contact lead problems that can be detrimental to transport measurements in pulsed magnetic fields. In addition the rf technique has the advantage of being more sensitive with several-orders-of-magnitude faster time response, hence making it suitable for millisecond duration pulsed magnetic fields (when compared to specific heat, for example). Our method, for determining a consistent H_{c2} point in the \Delta f vs \mu_{0}H data shown in Figs. 1 and 2, is based on identifying the point at which the slope of the rf signal (in the transition region) intercepts the slope of the normal-state background. The justification is simply that the high-field data (above H_{c2}) show a smooth close-to-linear magnetic

Below H_{c2} the suppression of the superconducting state with increasing field leads to a field-dependent frequency shift that results in a clear slope change in the data (see Figs. 1 and 2). The H_{c2} value is determined for each subsequent fixed temperature magnetic-field pulse producing the H-T plot (see Fig. 3).
