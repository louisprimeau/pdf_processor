###### Abstract

Superconducting-Hall-effect \(R_{H}\) transitions were measured on 11 YBa2Cu3O7-\(\delta\) epitaxial thin films grown under a range of electronic "doping" conditions. The data reveal that the relative magnitude of the anomalous sign reversals in \(R_{H}\) monotonically decrease with decreasing carrier density and vanish below a threshold cutoff value. The sign reversals in \(R_{H}\) are observed only in films having a negative normal-state Seebeck coefficient, and are correlated in magnitude. This suggests that the energy slope of the electronic density of states plays a role in the occurrence of these anomalies.

2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 11G15, 11  method are completely consistent with determinations made by holding the temperature fixed and sweeping the field from \(-\,8\,\) to \(+\,8\,\)T.) For the Seebeck measurements, copper voltage leads and type \(E\) thermocouple junctions were attached near each end of the film with silver paste. An external heater generated a small temperature difference across the film (about 3 K). The Seebeck coefficient with respect to copper is given by the measured voltage divided by the temperature difference. The absolute Seebeck coefficient of the film is then calculated by correcting for the known Seebeck coefficient for copper.

Budhani, Liou, and Cai [11] and Kunchur _et al._[12] have shown that flux pinning can reduce or even eliminate the Hall sign reversal anomaly. Therefore, flux pinning values were compared to the apparent carrier concentrations, I/\(R_{B}\epsilon\), to determine the role of pinning in these doping studies. Figure 2 illustrates that as oxygen is removed from a YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) thin film, reducing the apparent hole concentration, the Hall sign reversal can vanish, along with a weakening in the relative field dependence of the critical current density. In other words, as oxygen is removed from these films, the resulting decrease in the relative field dependence of the critical current densities reflects decreases in the pinning according to flux creep models.[20] Therefore, _increased_ flux pinning alone cannot explain the disappearance of the sign reversal with the decreases in oxygen content shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, Fig. 3(a) shows that the irreversibility line measured in six films (found from extrapolating \(F_{p}\)=\(J_{c}\)*\(B\) curves to zero[21]) increases with carrier concentration along with the sign reversal magnitudes. Note that the sign reversal magnitudes are defined as the maximum applied field \(B_{\max}\) where the sign reversals just exist at any temperature. This definition is chosen since the actual depth of the sign reversals depends on both the current density and the strength of the pinning, while \(B_{\max}\) is relatively insensitive to these parameters.[12] Finally, both the strength of the Hall sign reversals and the strength of the pinning monotonically increase with carrier concentration, and since pinning-induced backflow of the vortices has been ruled out as the mechanism for the Hall sign reversals,[11, 12] the electronic band structure remains as the key factor in this phenomenon.

Thermopower studies were conducted to determine if differences in the electronic structure could account for the correlation between the magnitude of the sign reversals and the normal-state carrier concentration, I/\(R_{H}\epsilon\), observed in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) [Fig. 3(a)]. In the relaxation time approximation, the diffusion thermopower is given by[22]\(S\)=\(\sigma_{s}/\sigma\), where

\[\sigma_{s}\!=\!\frac{k_{B}|e|}{\Omega_{0}}\!\sum_{\bf k}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\  phonon-drag effects, which may be very pronounced in YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7}\) single crystals,[13] are often absent in thin films [Fig. 3 (inset)] possibly as a result of increased phonon scattering in films. It is perhaps for this reason that correlations between the Seebeck coefficient and the Hall sign anomaly have not been reported previously.

Although several models[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54,  * [9] J.

* [17] Although not all films possess the maximum reported \(T_{c}\) of 92 K in the fully oxygenated state (\(\delta\)=0), all of the transition temperatures could be optimized to 92 K by rendering these films slightly oxygen deficient, suggesting that the initially lower \(T_{c}\) values may reflect an initial overdoping with holes.

In the films showing no sign reversals of the Hall coefficient, the Hall transitions were independent of the current density. In contrast, in the films showing sign reversals, the reversals were enhanced at the higher current densities indicating that pinning can suppress the sign reversals, as observed in Ref. [12].
