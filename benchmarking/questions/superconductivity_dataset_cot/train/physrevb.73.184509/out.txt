###### Abstract

We report measurements of the in-plane resistivity, magnetoresistivity (MR) and Hall effect of thin films of slightly under and nearly optimally doped Y0.95Ca0.05Ba2(Cu1-_x_Zn_x_)Oy (with x = 0, 0.02, 0.04) and overdoped Y0.95Ca0.1Ba2Cu3Oy. We found that the introduction of Zn as a dopant strongly suppresses the orbital MR in the normal state. Surprisingly it can be fitted to a _T_-4 law at lower temperatures where the resistivity and cotangent of the Hall angle cot _th_ are relatively constant and no longer obey the usual T1 and T2 laws, respectively. In other words, in these samples the increase in residual scattering rate produced by Zn has a stronger effect on cot _th_ than on the MR at low T. It seems that this new result requires some modification of well-known theories involving two distinct relaxation processes for transport and Hall currents.

## I Introduction

Understanding the normal state properties of cuprate superconductors, including the unusual variation with temperature and hole concentration of the Hall angle and the magnetoresistance (MR) could be an important step towards a correct microscopic theory of cuprate superconductivity. The hole concentration is usually expressed in terms of a parameter p, the number of added holes per CuO2 plane. Current understanding is that the overdoped region, where the pseudogap (PG) energy scale is zero, occurs when p > 0.19, [1] although even in this region the normal state transport properties are still anomalous. The optimally doped state where _T_c is a maximum is at p = 0.16.

There have been several theories of cuprate magnetotransport. In Anderson's theory [2] the response of the correlated electron system to a longitudinal electric field differs from the response to the Lorentz force, because the former alters the energy of an elementary excitation, while the latter only alters its transverse momentum. This difference gives rise to two distinct scattering times, t_{r} and t_{H} governing the in-plane resistivity r_{h} and Hall angle _th__H_, respectively. [2, 3, 4]\tau_{H} is predicted to obey the law 1/_t__H_ = A + _B_T_2 where the residual scattering term A increases linearly with Zn content and the coefficient B is constant, in approximate agreement with experimental data. [4] In this theory it is expected that the MR will vary as t_{H}. Strictly speaking the theory predicts the orbital magnetoconductance, but for the large MR effects studied here, this is very similar to the orbital MR, which is defined experimentally as the difference between the MR values for J \perp B and J \parallel_B_, where J is the current density and B the magnetic field.

A second approach ascribes the appearance of two relaxation times to the charge-conjugation symmetries of the elementary excitations or quasiparticles [5] (or in other words their electron-hole symmetries). In this theory the Hall current, which corresponds to the difference in electron and hole contributions, has a completely different relaxation time to the transport current which is the sum of electron and hole contributions.

A third, more conventional approach, is based on the idea of a Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles whose relaxation time t is strongly dependent on their wave vector **k**. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] This basic idea has been explored by several authors with various degrees of success. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] Such a strong **k** dependence is a natural consequence of the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid (NAFL) model developed by Pines and collaborators. [6] In the NAFL model those parts of the Fermi surface that are spanned by the spin fluctuation wave vector **Q** will clearly have a much larger scattering rate, and in the PG region probably a lower quasiparticle weight, than the parts which are not spanned. [6, 8] More recently Hussey [11] added a new ingredient, namely regions of the Fermi surface where the scattering is very strong still give a significant contribution to the conductivity, corresponding to the mean free path being equal to the lattice parameter. This model then gives a good account of much magnetotransport data for overdoped cuprates.

In this paper we report a systematic study of the magnetotransport properties of optimally or slightly under doped Y0.95Ca0.05Ba2(Cu1-_x_Zn_x_)3Oy (with x = 0, 0.02, 0.04) and overdoped Y0.95Ca0.1Ba2Cu3Oy thin films. We have measured in-plane resistivity, Hall voltage and angular dependent MR in the temperature range from just above T_{c} up to 300 K. We find that the introduction of Zn strongly suppresses the normal orbital MR \Delta\rho_{orb}/\rho. However because T_{c} is also suppressed we could still determine the characteristic T dependence of \Delta\rho_{orb}/\rho over a substantial temperature range. One intriguing new result is that \Delta\rho_{orb}/\rho can be fitted to _T_-4 behavior in a temperature region where the Hall angle _th__H_ is varying much more slowly than _T_-2 because of the strong scattering by Zn.

  

## II Experimental Details

The films were grown on SrTiO_{3} (100) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. Details of the method can be found in Refs. 12 and 13. Film stoichiometry was determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) using single crystal YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\eta}, CaCO_{3}, and ZnO as standards. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine the surface quality of the films and to determine their thickness, which is 300 +- 45 nm. The films were patterned into the standard shape shown later in the inset to Fig. 2(b), with two pairs of Hall and MR contacts per sample and silver paint contacts being made to evaporated gold pads. The transport measurements were made using standard low frequency ac methods with a measuring current of 10 _m_A. MR was measured in two ways (i) by sweeping the magnetic field from zero to 11 T and back, and (ii) by rotating the sample from 0deg to 285deg and back in a fixed magnetic field (usually 11 T) at constant temperature. In the former case the temperature was controlled to better than 5 mK using a Cernox thermometer mounted on the rotatable sample stage. For the latter, a RhFe thermometer whose orientation was fixed, was used to stabilize the temperature as the sample stage was rotated. The Cernox resistance sensor was carefully calibrated in magnetic fields up to 11 T with constant (or slowly drifting) temperatures provided by liquid nitrogen held at various pressures using a manostat or by solid CO_{2}. Figure 1 shows a comparison of our data with published work [14] that gives the average magnetoresistance of nine Cernox sensors. We found that over a large temperature region the temperature correction D_T_/_T_ varies as (_B_/_T_)2. The Cernox MR is a small but important effect, D_T_/_T_/_B_2 = 7.1 x 10-5 %/Tesla2 at 200 K in Fig. 1 giving a correction of 17 mK at 11 T. The standard deviation in the published data [14] for nine sensors is ~+- 50% and the results in Fig. 1 for our sensor are well within this. The error bars in MR are estimated at +- 2 10-5 in \Delta R/R at 11 T, and probably arise mainly from drifts in the gain of the two lock-in amplifiers since the two pairs of voltage contacts often gave different results at this level.

Hall measurements were made by rotating the sample by 180deg in a 6 T magnetic field, with linearity checks being made at several temperatures in fields up to 11 T. Because of the strong hole concentration dependence of normal and superconducting properties, [7, 8] it is important to determine p as accurately as possible. We have estimated p from room-temperature thermopower, _S_(290 K), using the correlation of Obertelli _et al._, [15] expressed numerically [16] as S(290 K) = -139p + 24.2 _m_V/K, for p > 0.155, and _S_(290 K) = 992 exp(-38.1_p_) _m_V/K, for 0.05 < p < 0.155. These values of p are given in Table 1 together with T_{c} values and transition widths (FWHM in _d_/_dT_). For YBCO _S_(290 K) does not vary much with Zn content [17] so it is still a good measure of p even in the presence of strong in-plane scattering by Zn.

## III Results and Discussion

The resistivity data of the four thin films are shown in Fig. 2(a) and their properties are summarized in Table 1. From previous work [18] the lower values of p correspond to a pseudogap value of _T_' = 200 +- 10 K. Hence the downturn in resistivity near 200 K for the 5% Ca 0% Zn sample in Fig. 2(a) is ascribed to the PG. There are no detectable downturn in the resistivity data for the two Zn doped samples. This is consistent with previous work [19, 20] and the p values in Table 1. Namely the 2% Zn sample has a higher value of p and hence _T_' ~ 100 K while 3% Zn or more is enough to mask the effect of the PG for _T_' ~ 200 K. Although there are small variations in p for the Y0.95Ca0.05Ba2(Cu1-Zn)3Oy samples shown in Fig. 2(a) and Table 1, our results

Figure 1: Comparison of the MR correction for our Cernox thermometer with the average correction for nine thermometers from Ref. 14 (Brandt _et al._). B perp. or _B_\mid means the applied field was perpendicular or parallel to the axis of the cylindrical thermometer can. In all cases the Cernox MR was negative and the data were fitted to B2 behavior. In the temperature range of interest 77.8–286 K the slope of the B2 fit was not changed significantly if some anomalous low-field points in the data of Ref. 14 were omitted, except at 286 K where only points between 14 and 20 T were included in the B2 fit.

 are consistent with an extrapolated residual resistivity, d\rho_{res}/dx = 21 +- 2 \mu\Omega cm/% Zn as obtained previously.[13, 18, 19] In the present case the oxygen disorder in the Cu-O chains is greater than for Ca-free films, so this residual resistivity definitely represents that from the CuO_{2} planes. It is noteworthy that the resistivity of the Zn-free 10% Ca sample (_p_ = 0.212 +- 0.004) is nearly a factor of two lower than the Zn-free 5% Ca one at all T, in agreement with the well-known empirical law[8] that 1/_pap_. As is usually found for overdoped samples, its T dependence is faster than linear. The 2% and 4% Zn samples have 55% and 60% larger slopes dp(T)/dT near 300 K than the 5% Ca, 0% Zn sample, showing that Mathiessen's rule is not exactly obeyed. A similar effect was also observed in a more detailed study of Ca-free films[8, 19, 20] and for single crystals.[4]

Corresponding Hall coefficient (R_{H}) data are shown in Fig. 2(b). From previous work[4, 7, 19] the magnitude of R_{H} is affected much more strongly by changes in oxygen deficiency than by changes in Zn content. The primary effect of Zn substitution is to suppress the temperature dependence of R_{H}. A more detailed study of Ca-free films[19] showed that R_{H} is independent of Zn doping at high T. Our results for the 0 and 4% Zn samples are consistent with this within the uncertainty in film thickness, while R_{H} values for the 2% Zn sample are lower because p is higher. The 4% Zn data in particular suggest that the broad peak in R_{H} near 80 K is unlikely to be caused by superconducting fluctuations, since T_{c} is only 34 K. We believe it arises from the behavior of _r__(_T_) and _th__H_ in the normal state. The experimental data for cot \theta_{H} = _r__(_T_)/_r__H_(_T_) where r_{H} = R_{H} is the Hall resistivity at a field of 6 T and r is the in-plane resistivity, respectively, are plotted versus T2 in Fig. 2(c). The data are approximately linear on this plot with a finite intercept that increases with Zn concentration, as found previously.[4] We s

The inset shows a diagram of the patterned films. (c) The corresponding cotangent of the Hall angle, measured at 6 T.

  the Zn-free samples is also independent of Ca content, i.e. p as also found earlier.[22] There are in fact the same kind of deviations from an A+BT^{2} law found previously.[4, 19, 21, 22] Namely there is a weak negative curvature for all samples and if the data are fitted to an A+BT^{m} law over the whole range of T then for all the samples m=1.67\pm 0.03 rather than m=2.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the magnetic field dependence of the in-plane resistivity in transverse geometry (B\|c,J\perp c) for the 5% Ca, 4% Zn, and the 10% Ca sample in the form of Kohler plots, namely \Delta\rho/\rho versus [B/\rho(B=0)]^{2} at several fixed temperatures. The transverse MR is positive and proportional to B^{2} from approximately T_{c}+20 K to 300 K. At temperatures closer to T_{c} (not shown) the MR starts to show negative curvature on a B^{2} plot and would eventually saturate at high fields. This is caused by a decrease in the characteristic magnetic field needed to suppress superconducting fluctuations, which varies as B_{c2}(T/T_{c}). Well above T_{c} this characteristic field is of order R_{c}(20) or 100 T, but at a few degrees both above and below T_{c} it is only a few Teslas, since just below T_{c}, dB_{c2}/dT\sim-2 T/K.

In conventional metals \Delta\rho/\rho usually varies as (\omega\tau)^{2}, where \omega is the cyclotron frequency and \tau is the relaxation time, and therefore Kohler's rule \Delta\rho/\rho\sim(B/\rho)^{2} is obeyed. However, other measurements of YBCO (with various dopings) strongly violate Kohler's rule,[3] so it is not surprising that this also happens for the present samples, indicating that the **k** independent \tau approximation never applies. The longitudinal MR (J\|B,J\perp c) is also positive but is always much smaller than the transverse MR. It falls below our measurement resolution above approximately T_{c}+20 K for 5% Ca, 0% Zn, and T_{c}+50 K for 5% Ca, 4% Zn. For this Zn-doped sample it probably arises from the effect of the magnetic field on the pseudogap, i.e., it is a spin effect, as suggested previously by others.[23] For the Zn-free 5% Ca sample the longitudinal MR probably arises from a combination of this effect and superconducting fluctuations. MR measurements as a function of the angle (\alpha) between magnetic field and the a-b plane of the sample have also been performed by rotating the sample at fixed magnetic field and fixed temperatures as described above. Some examples for one of the samples at 11 T are shown in Fig. 4. Similar results were also obtained for the other samples. The angular sweeps could be fitted by \Delta R/R_{0}=m_{1}\alpha+m_{2} sin \alpha+m_{3} sin^{2}\alpha where m_{1} represents a linear temperature drift term, m_{2} is a T dependent Hall contribution linear in magnetic field, and m_{3} is the orbital MR which generally dominates, scales precisely as B^{2} and falls rapidly with increasing temperature. Thus, m_{3} allows separation of the orbital MR from the total MR. Data for all samples are shown as log-log plots of \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(0,T) versus T, with B=11 T in Fig. 5. The data shown include those from (a) field sweeps in which the data were fitted to \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(0,T)=dB^{2} (open symbols), this gives the total transverse MR including orbital and spin parts, or (b) angle sweeps, (closed symbols), which give the orbital MR. The close correspondence between the two types of data underlines the smallness of the isotropic (spin) part mentioned above. The solid lines represent the power law \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(0,T)=\varepsilon T^{-4}, and the values of e are given in Table 1. Because of the resolution limit mentioned previously the orbital MR can be detected up to 300 K for x=0, but only up to 200 K and 160 K for Zn contents x=0.02 and x =0.04, respectively. The strong T^{-4} dependence of \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(0,T), while \rho(0,T)=a+bT+cT^{2}, corresponds to the strong deviations from Kohler's rule shown in Fig. 3.

Although a Fermi liquid model may not apply to the cuprates,[23] for a two-dimensional (2D) Fermi liquid the orbital MR arises from the variance of the local Hall angle around the Fermi surface[3] and can be written as

\[\Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)=\langle\theta(s)^{2}\rangle-\langle\theta(s)\rangle^{ 2},\] (1)

where \langle A\rangle=\not\xi A(s)\Sigma(s)ds/\not\xi\Sigma(s)ds, \Sigma(s) is the conductivity and ds is an element of length along the Fermi surface. \theta(s) is the local Hall angle and is proportional to \tau(s) the relaxation time in the elemental length ds multiplied by a local curvature factor related to the effective mass. In the earlier

  work^{3} on pure YBCO the observation that \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)\sim T^{-4} while \langle\theta(s)\rangle^{2}\sim T^{-4} was used to rule out the Fermi liquid model with a **k** dependent \tau. Namely in the simplest version of such models the variance in \tau, \langle(\tau(s)s^{2})\rangle-\langle(\tau(s))^{2}\rangle^{2}/\langle\tau(s) \rangle^{2} has to be strongly T dependent in order to account for the T dependence of R_{H} which is enhanced by a factor \overline{\tau(s)^{2}}/[\tau(s)]^{2}, where in this formula \overline{\tau(s)} is the mean value of \tau(s) without any conductivity weighting factor \Sigma(s).^{24} But this is difficult to reconcile with Eq. (1), if \Delta\rho/\rho and \langle\theta\rangle^{2}, i.e., \langle\tau(s)\rangle^{2} have the same T dependences. However the anisotropic \tau(\textbf{k}) model proposed by Hussey^{11} does give agreement with the behavior of the Hall angle and MR within experimental error. This is presumably because in this model the regions of the Fermi surface (FS) where \tau(s)\sim T^{-2} dominate both the Hall angle and MR. In the other regions the mean free path is equal to the in-plane lattice parameter and is therefore small and T independent. Furthermore the argument of Ref. 3 will not hold if the effective mass varies with temperature, for example from renormalization effects in a correlated electron system, and probably even if it varies very strongly around the Fermi surface. In the present work we find that the relation between the MR and the Hall angle is not the same at higher and lower temperatures, as discussed in more detail later.

Since the values of T_{c} of the various samples range between 85 and 34 K, superconducting fluctuations will affect the \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T) curves quite differently. The data in Fig. 5 suggest that superconducting fluctuations only become important below T_{c}+30 K, where there are strong upward deviations from the T^{-4} lines. The data suggest that the onset of fluctuations is relatively rapid below this temperature. In combination with appropriate theory these data could be used to shed light on another topic of current interest, namely the mechanism by which the fluctuation contributions to various physical properties is cut off above T_{c}. For Bi:2212 crystals the MR has been ascribed to superconducting

The solid lines are fits to a power law cot \theta_{H}=A +BT^{m}, with m=1.65. The same fits have been multiplied by factors of 0.5 to 0.8 for comparison with the corresponding MR data. The inserts show the low T region where the limiting T^{-4} behavior and the onset of fluctuations are visible.

  fluctuations [25] over the whole temperature range (up to 300 K). The present work suggests that the possibility of a T^{-4} term in the MR of Bi:2212 should also be considered, as an alternative to fluctuations, although they are larger in lower-dimensional systems and Bi:2212 is admittedly much more anisotropic than the YBCO samples studied here.

The ratios of the normal orbital MR to the square of the Hall angle, i.e., \left[\Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)\right]/\theta_{H}^{2} in a field of 11 T are shown for all four samples in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). It can be seen that in the Zn-free samples the ratios are 2+-0.2 at 120 K, and decrease weakly with increasing temperature, i.e., they are consistent with the law \left[\Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)\right]\sim\theta_{H}^{2}. On the other hand, for the Zn-doped samples the ratios are larger and more T dependent, increasing to values as high as 20 at 60 K (x=0.04). Thus, the observed normal orbital MR for these samples is only comparable to \langle\theta(s)\rangle^{2} (within a factor two) at higher temperatures, above approximately 130 K. In LSCO the ratio \left[\Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)\right]/\theta_{H}^{2} is also much larger [26, 25] and only T independent for certain values of p. [26] Similar results were found for c axis oriented epitaxial Bi-2212 films. [27]

Although the plots in Fig. 6 do show large differences between the MR and inverse Hall angle at low T, they are slightly misleading in that the main difference occurs in the residual term A rather than the BT^{2} term. In our opinion the combined plots of (R/\Delta R)^{1/2} and cot \theta_{H} vs T^{2} shown in Fig. 7 are more revealing. At higher values of T both quantities have similar slopes, the main difference, especially for the Zn doped samples, is that the low T intercept A is larger for cot \theta_{H} than for (R/\Delta R)^{1/2}. Furthermore, below \sim100 K the intercept of (R/\Delta R)^{1/2} disappears quite abruptly and as shown in the insets, the data can be fitted to T^{-4} laws, which is consistent with the conclusions drawn from the log-log plots in Fig. 5. The insets to Fig. 7 also show how superconducting fluctuations become significant below T_{c}+20 to T_{c} +-30 K as well as the expected divergence in \Delta R/R as T\rightarrowT_{c}, i.e., (R/\Delta R)^{1/2} extrapolates to zero near T_{c}. Therefore, from the plots shown in Fig. 7 we can see that the two-lifetime pictures work reasonably well at higher T although, even there, Zn substitution does have a significantly larger effect on the residual scattering term in cot \Theta_{H} than that in (R/\Delta R)^{1/2}. At lower temperatures this effect becomes even more extreme in that the MR can be fitted to a T^{-4} law with no significant residual scattering term, while the residual term in cot \Theta_{H} remains finite, although probably smaller than that at higher T. Within the **k** dependent \tau model of Hussey [11] one possibility is that these unusual effects arise because of anisotropic **k** dependent scattering by Zn atoms. [28] This is currently being investigated numerically. Anisotropic scattering by zinc atoms might be a possible way of accounting for the discrepancies between our data and the non-Fermi liquid two-lifetime models at low T.

## IV Summary and conclusions

In summary, we report measurements of the in-plane resistivity, magnetoresistivity, and Hall resistivity of under and nearly optimally doped Y_{0.95}Ca_{0.05}Ba_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{y} (x =0,0.02,0.04) and overdoped Y_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} films. The orbital MR is strongly suppressed with increasing Zn concentration, but the lower T_{c} values have allowed us to follow its T dependence over a substantial temperature range. There are deviations from the two-lifetime models in that at low T the extra scattering introduced by zinc doping has a stronger effect on co \Theta_{H} than it does on the orbital MR which can still be fitted to a T^{-4} law.

###### Abstract

We report measurements of the in-plane resistivity, magnetoresistivity (MR) and Hall effect of thin films of slightly under and nearly optimally doped Y0.95Ca0.05Ba2(Cu1-_x_Zn_x_)Oy (with x = 0, 0.02, 0.04) and overdoped Y0.95Ca0.1Ba2Cu3Oy. We found that the introduction of Zn as a dopant strongly suppresses the orbital MR in the normal state. Surprisingly it can be fitted to a _T_-4 law at lower temperatures where the resistivity and cotangent of the Hall angle cot _th_ are relatively constant and no longer obey the usual T1 and T2 laws, respectively. In other words, in these samples the increase in residual scattering rate produced by Zn has a stronger effect on cot _th_ than on the MR at low T. It seems that this new result requires some modification of well-known theories involving two distinct relaxation processes for transport and Hall currents.

## I Introduction

Understanding the normal state properties of cuprate superconductors, including the unusual variation with temperature and hole concentration of the Hall angle and the magnetoresistance (MR) could be an important step towards a correct microscopic theory of cuprate superconductivity. The hole concentration is usually expressed in terms of a parameter p, the number of added holes per CuO2 plane. Current understanding is that the overdoped region, where the pseudogap (PG) energy scale is zero, occurs when p > 0.19, [1] although even in this region the normal state transport properties are still anomalous. The optimally doped state where _T_c is a maximum is at p = 0.16.

There have been several theories of cuprate magnetotransport. In Anderson's theory [2] the response of the correlated electron system to a longitudinal electric field differs from the response to the Lorentz force, because the former alters the energy of an elementary excitation, while the latter only alters its transverse momentum. This difference gives rise to two distinct scattering times, t_{r} and t_{H} governing the in-plane resistivity r_{h} and Hall angle _th__H_, respectively. [2, 3, 4]\tau_{H} is predicted to obey the law 1/_t__H_ = A + _B_T_2 where the residual scattering term A increases linearly with Zn content and the coefficient B is constant, in approximate agreement with experimental data. [4] In this theory it is expected that the MR will vary as t_{H}. Strictly speaking the theory predicts the orbital magnetoconductance, but for the large MR effects studied here, this is very similar to the orbital MR, which is defined experimentally as the difference between the MR values for J \perp B and J \parallel_B_, where J is the current density and B the magnetic field.

A second approach ascribes the appearance of two relaxation times to the charge-conjugation symmetries of the elementary excitations or quasiparticles [5] (or in other words their electron-hole symmetries). In this theory the Hall current, which corresponds to the difference in electron and hole contributions, has a completely different relaxation time to the transport current which is the sum of electron and hole contributions.

A third, more conventional approach, is based on the idea of a Fermi liquid with well-defined quasiparticles whose relaxation time t is strongly dependent on their wave vector **k**. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] This basic idea has been explored by several authors with various degrees of success. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] Such a strong **k** dependence is a natural consequence of the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid (NAFL) model developed by Pines and collaborators. [6] In the NAFL model those parts of the Fermi surface that are spanned by the spin fluctuation wave vector **Q** will clearly have a much larger scattering rate, and in the PG region probably a lower quasiparticle weight, than the parts which are not spanned. [6, 8] More recently Hussey [11] added a new ingredient, namely regions of the Fermi surface where the scattering is very strong still give a significant contribution to the conductivity, corresponding to the mean free path being equal to the lattice parameter. This model then gives a good account of much magnetotransport data for overdoped cuprates.

In this paper we report a systematic study of the magnetotransport properties of optimally or slightly under doped Y0.95Ca0.05Ba2(Cu1-_x_Zn_x_)3Oy (with x = 0, 0.02, 0.04) and overdoped Y0.95Ca0.1Ba2Cu3Oy thin films. We have measured in-plane resistivity, Hall voltage and angular dependent MR in the temperature range from just above T_{c} up to 300 K. We find that the introduction of Zn strongly suppresses the normal orbital MR \Delta\rho_{orb}/\rho. However because T_{c} is also suppressed we could still determine the characteristic T dependence of \Delta\rho_{orb}/\rho over a substantial temperature range. One intriguing new result is that \Delta\rho_{orb}/\rho can be fitted to _T_-4 behavior in a temperature region where the Hall angle _th__H_ is varying much more slowly than _T_-2 because of the strong scattering by Zn.

  

## II Experimental Details

The films were grown on SrTiO_{3} (100) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. Details of the method can be found in Refs. 12 and 13. Film stoichiometry was determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) using single crystal YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\eta}, CaCO_{3}, and ZnO as standards. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine the surface quality of the films and to determine their thickness, which is 300 +- 45 nm. The films were patterned into the standard shape shown later in the inset to Fig. 2(b), with two pairs of Hall and MR contacts per sample and silver paint contacts being made to evaporated gold pads. The transport measurements were made using standard low frequency ac methods with a measuring current of 10 _m_A. MR was measured in two ways (i) by sweeping the magnetic field from zero to 11 T and back, and (ii) by rotating the sample from 0deg to 285deg and back in a fixed magnetic field (usually 11 T) at constant temperature. In the former case the temperature was controlled to better than 5 mK using a Cernox thermometer mounted on the rotatable sample stage. For the latter, a RhFe thermometer whose orientation was fixed, was used to stabilize the temperature as the sample stage was rotated. The Cernox resistance sensor was carefully calibrated in magnetic fields up to 11 T with constant (or slowly drifting) temperatures provided by liquid nitrogen held at various pressures using a manostat or by solid CO_{2}. Figure 1 shows a comparison of our data with published work [14] that gives the average magnetoresistance of nine Cernox sensors. We found that over a large temperature region the temperature correction D_T_/_T_ varies as (_B_/_T_)2. The Cernox MR is a small but important effect, D_T_/_T_/_B_2 = 7.1 x 10-5 %/Tesla2 at 200 K in Fig. 1 giving a correction of 17 mK at 11 T. The standard deviation in the published data [14] for nine sensors is ~+- 50% and the results in Fig. 1 for our sensor are well within this. The error bars in MR are estimated at +- 2 10-5 in \Delta R/R at 11 T, and probably arise mainly from drifts in the gain of the two lock-in amplifiers since the two pairs of voltage contacts often gave different results at this level.

Hall measurements were made by rotating the sample by 180deg in a 6 T magnetic field, with linearity checks being made at several temperatures in fields up to 11 T. Because of the strong hole concentration dependence of normal and superconducting properties, [7, 8] it is important to determine p as accurately as possible. We have estimated p from room-temperature thermopower, _S_(290 K), using the correlation of Obertelli _et al._, [15] expressed numerically [16] as S(290 K) = -139p + 24.2 _m_V/K, for p > 0.155, and _S_(290 K) = 992 exp(-38.1_p_) _m_V/K, for 0.05 < p < 0.155. These values of p are given in Table 1 together with T_{c} values and transition widths (FWHM in _d_/_dT_). For YBCO _S_(290 K) does not vary much with Zn content [17] so it is still a good measure of p even in the presence of strong in-plane scattering by Zn.

## III Results and Discussion

The resistivity data of the four thin films are shown in Fig. 2(a) and their properties are summarized in Table 1. From previous work [18] the lower values of p correspond to a pseudogap value of _T_' = 200 +- 10 K. Hence the downturn in resistivity near 200 K for the 5% Ca 0% Zn sample in Fig. 2(a) is ascribed to the PG. There are no detectable downturn in the resistivity data for the two Zn doped samples. This is consistent with previous work [19, 20] and the p values in Table 1. Namely the 2% Zn sample has a higher value of p and hence _T_' ~ 100 K while 3% Zn or more is enough to mask the effect of the PG for _T_' ~ 200 K. Although there are small variations in p for the Y0.95Ca0.05Ba2(Cu1-Zn)3Oy samples shown in Fig. 2(a) and Table 1, our results

Figure 1: Comparison of the MR correction for our Cernox thermometer with the average correction for nine thermometers from Ref. 14 (Brandt _et al._). B perp. or _B_\mid means the applied field was perpendicular or parallel to the axis of the cylindrical thermometer can. In all cases the Cernox MR was negative and the data were fitted to B2 behavior. In the temperature range of interest 77.8–286 K the slope of the B2 fit was not changed significantly if some anomalous low-field points in the data of Ref. 14 were omitted, except at 286 K where only points between 14 and 20 T were included in the B2 fit.

 are consistent with an extrapolated residual resistivity, d\rho_{res}/dx = 21 +- 2 \mu\Omega cm/% Zn as obtained previously.[13, 18, 19] In the present case the oxygen disorder in the Cu-O chains is greater than for Ca-free films, so this residual resistivity definitely represents that from the CuO_{2} planes. It is noteworthy that the resistivity of the Zn-free 10% Ca sample (_p_ = 0.212 +- 0.004) is nearly a factor of two lower than the Zn-free 5% Ca one at all T, in agreement with the well-known empirical law[8] that 1/_pap_. As is usually found for overdoped samples, its T dependence is faster than linear. The 2% and 4% Zn samples have 55% and 60% larger slopes dp(T)/dT near 300 K than the 5% Ca, 0% Zn sample, showing that Mathiessen's rule is not exactly obeyed. A similar effect was also observed in a more detailed study of Ca-free films[8, 19, 20] and for single crystals.[4]

Corresponding Hall coefficient (R_{H}) data are shown in Fig. 2(b). From previous work[4, 7, 19] the magnitude of R_{H} is affected much more strongly by changes in oxygen deficiency than by changes in Zn content. The primary effect of Zn substitution is to suppress the temperature dependence of R_{H}. A more detailed study of Ca-free films[19] showed that R_{H} is independent of Zn doping at high T. Our results for the 0 and 4% Zn samples are consistent with this within the uncertainty in film thickness, while R_{H} values for the 2% Zn sample are lower because p is higher. The 4% Zn data in particular suggest that the broad peak in R_{H} near 80 K is unlikely to be caused by superconducting fluctuations, since T_{c} is only 34 K. We believe it arises from the behavior of _r__(_T_) and _th__H_ in the normal state. The experimental data for cot \theta_{H} = _r__(_T_)/_r__H_(_T_) where r_{H} = R_{H} is the Hall resistivity at a field of 6 T and r is the in-plane resistivity, respectively, are plotted versus T2 in Fig. 2(c). The data are approximately linear on this plot with a finite intercept that increases with Zn concentration, as found previously.[4] We s

The inset shows a diagram of the patterned films. (c) The corresponding cotangent of the Hall angle, measured at 6 T.

  the Zn-free samples is also independent of Ca content, i.e. p as also found earlier.[22] There are in fact the same kind of deviations from an A+BT^{2} law found previously.[4, 19, 21, 22] Namely there is a weak negative curvature for all samples and if the data are fitted to an A+BT^{m} law over the whole range of T then for all the samples m=1.67\pm 0.03 rather than m=2.

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the magnetic field dependence of the in-plane resistivity in transverse geometry (B\|c,J\perp c) for the 5% Ca, 4% Zn, and the 10% Ca sample in the form of Kohler plots, namely \Delta\rho/\rho versus [B/\rho(B=0)]^{2} at several fixed temperatures. The transverse MR is positive and proportional to B^{2} from approximately T_{c}+20 K to 300 K. At temperatures closer to T_{c} (not shown) the MR starts to show negative curvature on a B^{2} plot and would eventually saturate at high fields. This is caused by a decrease in the characteristic magnetic field needed to suppress superconducting fluctuations, which varies as B_{c2}(T/T_{c}). Well above T_{c} this characteristic field is of order R_{c}(20) or 100 T, but at a few degrees both above and below T_{c} it is only a few Teslas, since just below T_{c}, dB_{c2}/dT\sim-2 T/K.

In conventional metals \Delta\rho/\rho usually varies as (\omega\tau)^{2}, where \omega is the cyclotron frequency and \tau is the relaxation time, and therefore Kohler's rule \Delta\rho/\rho\sim(B/\rho)^{2} is obeyed. However, other measurements of YBCO (with various dopings) strongly violate Kohler's rule,[3] so it is not surprising that this also happens for the present samples, indicating that the **k** independent \tau approximation never applies. The longitudinal MR (J\|B,J\perp c) is also positive but is always much smaller than the transverse MR. It falls below our measurement resolution above approximately T_{c}+20 K for 5% Ca, 0% Zn, and T_{c}+50 K for 5% Ca, 4% Zn. For this Zn-doped sample it probably arises from the effect of the magnetic field on the pseudogap, i.e., it is a spin effect, as suggested previously by others.[23] For the Zn-free 5% Ca sample the longitudinal MR probably arises from a combination of this effect and superconducting fluctuations. MR measurements as a function of the angle (\alpha) between magnetic field and the a-b plane of the sample have also been performed by rotating the sample at fixed magnetic field and fixed temperatures as described above. Some examples for one of the samples at 11 T are shown in Fig. 4. Similar results were also obtained for the other samples. The angular sweeps could be fitted by \Delta R/R_{0}=m_{1}\alpha+m_{2} sin \alpha+m_{3} sin^{2}\alpha where m_{1} represents a linear temperature drift term, m_{2} is a T dependent Hall contribution linear in magnetic field, and m_{3} is the orbital MR which generally dominates, scales precisely as B^{2} and falls rapidly with increasing temperature. Thus, m_{3} allows separation of the orbital MR from the total MR. Data for all samples are shown as log-log plots of \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(0,T) versus T, with B=11 T in Fig. 5. The data shown include those from (a) field sweeps in which the data were fitted to \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(0,T)=dB^{2} (open symbols), this gives the total transverse MR including orbital and spin parts, or (b) angle sweeps, (closed symbols), which give the orbital MR. The close correspondence between the two types of data underlines the smallness of the isotropic (spin) part mentioned above. The solid lines represent the power law \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(0,T)=\varepsilon T^{-4}, and the values of e are given in Table 1. Because of the resolution limit mentioned previously the orbital MR can be detected up to 300 K for x=0, but only up to 200 K and 160 K for Zn contents x=0.02 and x =0.04, respectively. The strong T^{-4} dependence of \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(0,T), while \rho(0,T)=a+bT+cT^{2}, corresponds to the strong deviations from Kohler's rule shown in Fig. 3.

Although a Fermi liquid model may not apply to the cuprates,[23] for a two-dimensional (2D) Fermi liquid the orbital MR arises from the variance of the local Hall angle around the Fermi surface[3] and can be written as

\[\Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)=\langle\theta(s)^{2}\rangle-\langle\theta(s)\rangle^{ 2},\] (1)

where \langle A\rangle=\not\xi A(s)\Sigma(s)ds/\not\xi\Sigma(s)ds, \Sigma(s) is the conductivity and ds is an element of length along the Fermi surface. \theta(s) is the local Hall angle and is proportional to \tau(s) the relaxation time in the elemental length ds multiplied by a local curvature factor related to the effective mass. In the earlier

  work^{3} on pure YBCO the observation that \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)\sim T^{-4} while \langle\theta(s)\rangle^{2}\sim T^{-4} was used to rule out the Fermi liquid model with a **k** dependent \tau. Namely in the simplest version of such models the variance in \tau, \langle(\tau(s)s^{2})\rangle-\langle(\tau(s))^{2}\rangle^{2}/\langle\tau(s) \rangle^{2} has to be strongly T dependent in order to account for the T dependence of R_{H} which is enhanced by a factor \overline{\tau(s)^{2}}/[\tau(s)]^{2}, where in this formula \overline{\tau(s)} is the mean value of \tau(s) without any conductivity weighting factor \Sigma(s).^{24} But this is difficult to reconcile with Eq. (1), if \Delta\rho/\rho and \langle\theta\rangle^{2}, i.e., \langle\tau(s)\rangle^{2} have the same T dependences. However the anisotropic \tau(\textbf{k}) model proposed by Hussey^{11} does give agreement with the behavior of the Hall angle and MR within experimental error. This is presumably because in this model the regions of the Fermi surface (FS) where \tau(s)\sim T^{-2} dominate both the Hall angle and MR. In the other regions the mean free path is equal to the in-plane lattice parameter and is therefore small and T independent. Furthermore the argument of Ref. 3 will not hold if the effective mass varies with temperature, for example from renormalization effects in a correlated electron system, and probably even if it varies very strongly around the Fermi surface. In the present work we find that the relation between the MR and the Hall angle is not the same at higher and lower temperatures, as discussed in more detail later.

Since the values of T_{c} of the various samples range between 85 and 34 K, superconducting fluctuations will affect the \Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T) curves quite differently. The data in Fig. 5 suggest that superconducting fluctuations only become important below T_{c}+30 K, where there are strong upward deviations from the T^{-4} lines. The data suggest that the onset of fluctuations is relatively rapid below this temperature. In combination with appropriate theory these data could be used to shed light on another topic of current interest, namely the mechanism by which the fluctuation contributions to various physical properties is cut off above T_{c}. For Bi:2212 crystals the MR has been ascribed to superconducting

The solid lines are fits to a power law cot \theta_{H}=A +BT^{m}, with m=1.65. The same fits have been multiplied by factors of 0.5 to 0.8 for comparison with the corresponding MR data. The inserts show the low T region where the limiting T^{-4} behavior and the onset of fluctuations are visible.

  fluctuations [25] over the whole temperature range (up to 300 K). The present work suggests that the possibility of a T^{-4} term in the MR of Bi:2212 should also be considered, as an alternative to fluctuations, although they are larger in lower-dimensional systems and Bi:2212 is admittedly much more anisotropic than the YBCO samples studied here.

The ratios of the normal orbital MR to the square of the Hall angle, i.e., \left[\Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)\right]/\theta_{H}^{2} in a field of 11 T are shown for all four samples in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). It can be seen that in the Zn-free samples the ratios are 2+-0.2 at 120 K, and decrease weakly with increasing temperature, i.e., they are consistent with the law \left[\Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)\right]\sim\theta_{H}^{2}. On the other hand, for the Zn-doped samples the ratios are larger and more T dependent, increasing to values as high as 20 at 60 K (x=0.04). Thus, the observed normal orbital MR for these samples is only comparable to \langle\theta(s)\rangle^{2} (within a factor two) at higher temperatures, above approximately 130 K. In LSCO the ratio \left[\Delta\rho(B,T)/\rho(T)\right]/\theta_{H}^{2} is also much larger [26, 25] and only T independent for certain values of p. [26] Similar results were found for c axis oriented epitaxial Bi-2212 films. [27]

Although the plots in Fig. 6 do show large differences between the MR and inverse Hall angle at low T, they are slightly misleading in that the main difference occurs in the residual term A rather than the BT^{2} term. In our opinion the combined plots of (R/\Delta R)^{1/2} and cot \theta_{H} vs T^{2} shown in Fig. 7 are more revealing. At higher values of T both quantities have similar slopes, the main difference, especially for the Zn doped samples, is that the low T intercept A is larger for cot \theta_{H} than for (R/\Delta R)^{1/2}. Furthermore, below \sim100 K the intercept of (R/\Delta R)^{1/2} disappears quite abruptly and as shown in the insets, the data can be fitted to T^{-4} laws, which is consistent with the conclusions drawn from the log-log plots in Fig. 5. The insets to Fig. 7 also show how superconducting fluctuations become significant below T_{c}+20 to T_{c} +-30 K as well as the expected divergence in \Delta R/R as T\rightarrowT_{c}, i.e., (R/\Delta R)^{1/2} extrapolates to zero near T_{c}. Therefore, from the plots shown in Fig. 7 we can see that the two-lifetime pictures work reasonably well at higher T although, even there, Zn substitution does have a significantly larger effect on the residual scattering term in cot \Theta_{H} than that in (R/\Delta R)^{1/2}. At lower temperatures this effect becomes even more extreme in that the MR can be fitted to a T^{-4} law with no significant residual scattering term, while the residual term in cot \Theta_{H} remains finite, although probably smaller than that at higher T. Within the **k** dependent \tau model of Hussey [11] one possibility is that these unusual effects arise because of anisotropic **k** dependent scattering by Zn atoms. [28] This is currently being investigated numerically. Anisotropic scattering by zinc atoms might be a possible way of accounting for the discrepancies between our data and the non-Fermi liquid two-lifetime models at low T.

## IV Summary and conclusions

In summary, we report measurements of the in-plane resistivity, magnetoresistivity, and Hall resistivity of under and nearly optimally doped Y_{0.95}Ca_{0.05}Ba_{2}(Cu_{1-x}Zn_{x})_{3}O_{y} (x =0,0.02,0.04) and overdoped Y_{0.9}Ca_{0.1}Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} films. The orbital MR is strongly suppressed with increasing Zn concentration, but the lower T_{c} values have allowed us to follow its T dependence over a substantial temperature range. There are deviations from the two-lifetime models in that at low T the extra scattering introduced by zinc doping has a stronger effect on co \Theta_{H} than it does on the orbital MR which can still be fitted to a T^{-4} law.
