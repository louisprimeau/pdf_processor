###### Abstract

The variation of superconducting transition temperature (_T\({}_{c}\)_) with hydrostatic pressure up to 21 kbar is reported for compounds in the pseudoternary systems (Lu1-_x_Sc_x_)5Ir4Si10 (0.05 \(\leq\) \(x\) \(\leq\) 0.95) and (Lu0,R0.1)5Ir4Si10 (_R_ = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Sc, Y, and Th). Measurements of the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity and ac magnetic susceptibility for (Lu1-_x_Sc_x_)5Ir4Si10 (0.005 \(\leq\) \(x\) \(\leq\) 0.02) are made to show the correlation between the decrease of the charge-density-wave formation temperature (_T\({}_{0}\)_) and the increase of _T\({}_{c}\)_. (Lu0.98Sc0.02)5Ir4Si10 and Lu9(Ir0.78Rh0.22)4Si10, which have _T\({}_{c}\)_ about 2 K higher than Lu3Ir4Si10, are used to study the enhanced superconducting state with upper-critical-magnetic-field measurements. Changes in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level and the electron-phonon interaction play an important role in these pseudoternary compounds.

## I Introduction

Since the discovery[1] of a sudden striking enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature _T\({}_{c}\)_ from 3.8 to 9 K in Lu3Ir4Si10 at a critical pressure of about 20 kbar, several efforts have also been made to try to answer the following questions: What is the nature of this phase transition? What kind of mechanism should be responsible for this dramatic pressure effect on _T\({}_{c}\)_? For instance, measurements of the volume dependence of _T\({}_{c}\)_ in (Lu1-_x_Sc_x_)5Ir4Si10 and Lu5(Ir1-_x_Rh_x_)4Si10, low-temperature (down to 21 K) powder x-ray diffraction experiments, and isothermal bulk modulus measurement[2] taken up to 26 kbar at four different temperatures ranging from 293 to 14 K indicate that the transformation responsible for this enormous pressure enhancement of _T\({}_{c}\)_ is probably electronic in nature with no major effect on the cohesive energy of the crystal.

Measurements[2] of the static magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity of Lu3Ir4Si10 as a function of temperature exhibit a remarkable anomaly at 83 K. This indicates an electronic phase transition involving the development of a charge-density wave (CDW) opens an energy gap over a portion of the Fermi surface. Results of the pressure effects[2] on the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity demonstrate that the pressure enhancement of _T\({}_{c}\)_ is due to a progressive removal of the CDW in the crystal.

In this paper, we use the pseudoternary system (Lu1-_x_Sc_x_)5Ir4Si10 to study the effect of atomic disorder on CDW formation and the competition between the CDW transition temperature _T\({}_{0}\)_ and the superconducting transition temperature _T\({}_{c}\)_.

## II Experimental Methods

All samples were prepared from high-purity elements by arc melting in an argon atmosphere. After the melting process, the samples were sealed in quartz ampules under a partial pressure of argon and annealed at 1250 degC for one day followed by three days at 1050 degC. Mass loss during this synthesis and heat treatment was negligible. Powder x-ray diffraction data confirmed the single phase with the Sc5Co4Si10-type structure.

Details of the measurement technique for determining the pressure dependence of _T\({}_{c}\)_ may be found in Ref. 1. The dc electrical resistivity was measured on a rectangular parallelepiped of approximate dimensions 1 x 1 x 5 mm\({}^{\prime}\) using a four-probe method. The upper critical field as a function of temperature was determined from magnetization-versus-field curves taken in a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer.

## III Results and Discussion

The pressure dependence of _T\({}_{c}\)_ for the (Lu1-_x_Sc_x_)5Ir4Si10 system is shown in Fig. 1. The following observations based on the data can be made.

(1) The compounds can be separated into two groups. With low Sc content (_x_ = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) _T\({}_{c}\)_'s are lower and enhanced by external pressure. With higher Sc content (_x_ = 0.3, 0.5, 0.95, and 1.0) _T\({}_{c}\)_'s are higher and depressed by external pressure. There is a trend for _T\({}_{c}\)_ to approach a certain limiting value of about 7 K at high pressure.

(2) A critical concentration occurs at about \(x\) = 0.3. Below this concentration, the phases exhibit an electronic instability and are sensitive to external pressure. This is consistent with previously published data,1 where the volume of the \(x\) = 0.3 sample at ambient pressure is about the same as that of an \(x\) = 0 sample at 20 kbar.

(3) It is surprising that no sudden jump in \(T_{c}\) is observed up to 21 kbar even at very low concentration (_x_ = 0.05). This means that the nature of the pressure-induced phase transformation in Lu5Ir4Si10 is more likely of an electronic type and very easily destroyed by sublattice substitution.

The pressure effects on superconductivity for some alloys related to Lu5Ir4Si10 are summarized in Table 1. The alloying of magnetic rare earths on the Lu site suppresses the ambient-pressure \(T_{c}\), in accord with the pair-breaking theory of Abrikosov and Gor'kov.3 Pressure-induced \(T_{c}\) effects are still observed at around 20-22 kbar and \(T_{c}\) jumps (D_T__c_) are almost the same (about 5 K) even for the low \(T_{c}\) (1 K) in (Lu0.9Dy0.1)sIr4Si10. Substituting 10% of Th for Lu, enhances \(T_{c}\) both at ambient and high pressures. This may be due to the different valence between Th (4+) and Lu (3+). In order to study the effects of atomic size and electronic configuration on the anomaly in resistivity of Lu5Ir4Si10, we have substituted on both the Lu and Ir sites with various elements.

Normalized resistivity as a function of temperature for the pseudoternary system (Lu1-_x_Sc_x_)3Ir4Si10 is shown in Fig. 2. The reason why we choose Sc to substitute for Lu is to chemically "contract" the lattice, since Sc has a smaller metallic radius, resulting in a non-negligible size effect in the alloying process. At \(x\) = 0.05, the resistivity is almost identical to that of \(x\) = 0 in the high-temperature (_T_ > 250 K) region; then it starts to deviate as temperature is lowered. No noticeable anomaly appears, and the curve ends with a smaller residual resistivity ratio. With a further increase in \(x\) (for instance, with \(x\) = 0.1), the resistivity curve becomes flatter with an even smaller residual resistivity ratio (RRR). For \(x\) = 0.3, the RRR is larger than that of the \(x\) = 0 sample. Combining the results of resistivity under pressure with the value of bulk modulus2 1370 +- 70 kbar for Lu5Ir4Si10, we determine that the unit-cell volume of \(x\) = 0.05 at ambient pressure approximately equals that of \(x\) = 0 at 3.3 kbar. As we have seen in Fig. 2, with 5% Sc substitution,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}  & \(T_{c}\)(0) & \(P_{c}\) & _ΔT__c_ & _dT__c_/_dp_ & \(T_{0}\) \\ Compound & (K) & (kbar) & (K) & (10−3 K/bar) & (K) \\ Lu5Ir4Si10 & 3.72 & 20.5 & 5.4 & −1.17 & 81 \\ Lu5Ir4Si10 & 3.74 & 20.8 & 5.4 & −1.34 & 82 \\ (Lu0.95Sc0.05)sIr4Si10 & 6.06 & • & • & 3.14 & • \\ (Lu0.9Sc0.1)sIr4Si10 & 6.09 & • & • & 1.23 & • \\ (Lu0.8Sc0.2)sIr4Si10 &  the anomaly in the resistivity is totally suppressed. Contrasting this with the pressure data of pure Lu\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) shown in Ref. 2, we conclude that the substitution of Sc not only gives rise to a size effect but induces an atomic disorder to suppress the anomaly in resistivity for Lu\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\). This observation is consistent with the presence of a CDW in Lu\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\).

Figure 3 shows the normalized resistivity as a function of temperature for the pseudoternary systems (Lu\({}_{0.9}\)_R_\({}_{0.1}\))\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) (_R_ = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Sc, Y, and Th). An anomaly is still seen for \(R\) = Dy\(-\)Tm and Y, is smeared out for \(R\) = Th, and disappears completely for \(R\) = Sc. These results are consistent with the data presented in Table 1, namely, that an anomaly in resistiv

Figure 2: Normalized resistivity as a function of temperature for the pseudoternary system (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{x}\)Si\({}_{10}\) (_x_ =0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0).

  ity is always associated with a jump in \(T_{c}\) at high pressure. Because the atomic volume of these atoms (except Sc) is larger than that of Lu, no alloying compression comes into the system to suppress the anomaly. On the other hand, all the pure ternary compounds \(R_{s}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) (\(R=\) Dy\({}_{-}\)Tm and Y) have an anomaly in the resistivity.[4] Thus, the presence of the anomaly in the \(R_{s}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) compounds results in a reduced effect in the (Lu\({}_{0.9}\)\(R_{0.1}\))\({}_{s}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) system. The (Lu\({}_{0.9}\)Th\({}_{0.1}\))\({}_{s}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) compound shows a slightly different feature. The anomaly in the resistivity is much less pronounced than that of the others. This result correlates with the pressure data where the \(T_{c}\) jump is absent, but with a bigger positive value of \(dT_{c}/dp\). It is probably due to the tetravalent nature of Th as distinct from the trivalent rare earths.

It has been suggested[5] that CDW formation and superconductivity are antagonistic, both competing for states near the Fermi surface. In our previous report,[2] we have shown a suppression of the CDW and an increase of superconducting transition temperature by the application of pressure. At present, we use a quite separate way to study the interplay between superconductivity and CDW in Lu\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) by doping with Sc impurities on Lu sites. The presence of an impurity in a CDW material may lead to a change of the CDW transition temperature \(T_{0}\) and also to a possible smearing of the CDW transition itself. The mathematical analogy between the theories describing a (BCS) superconductor and CDW state suggests[6] that magnetic impurities in a superconductor play a role equivalent to that of nonmagnetic impurities in a CDW system. In analogy to superconductors, the critical mean free path \(\lambda_{\rm cr}=\nu_{F}\varrho_{\rm cr}\) for the electrons in a CDW system.[7, 8] is \(\lambda_{\rm cr}\propto 1.14\Phi_{F}/T_{0}\). Here \(\nu_{F}\) is the Fermi velocity, \(1/b_{\rm cr}\) is the critical pair-breaking parameter for a BCS superconductor, and \(T_{0}\) is the CDW transition temperature in the absence of impurities. The quantity \(\lambda_{\rm cr}\) may be associated with an effective localization length applicable to any disorder. Consequently, in the dilute impurity limit, \(T_{0}\) decreases linearly with increasing impurity concentration. In addition to scattering electrons and inducing a finite electron lifetime, an impurity may also induce Friedel oscillations in the electron-charge distribution, leading to a static lattice distortion. A direct result of this effect is a smearing of the CDW transition.

Normalized resistivity as a function of temperature be

  tween 30 and 90 K for pure and doped samples is shown in Fig. 4. It shows that replacing 0.5% of the Lu atoms by Sc atoms results in a decrease of CDW transition temperature by approximately 9 K. At 5 at. % Sc doping, the transition is so depressed that it is no longer detectable. The concentration dependence of the CDW temperature \(T_{0}\), the amplitude of anomaly in resistivity \(\Delta\rho/\rho({\rm 300~{}K})\), and the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) for the pseudoternary system (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{x}\)\({}_{x}\)Si\({}_{10}\) (\(x\) = 0.0, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02) are presented in Fig. 5. It is shown that the impurities lower the \(T_{0}\), broaden and smear the CDW transition, while increasing \(T_{c}\) just as one would expect in this system. We calculate the initial concentration dependence of \(T_{0}\) and \(T_{c}\) to be \((dT_{0}/dx)_{x}\)= = - 18.5 K/at. % and \((dT_{c}/dx)_{x}\) = 0 = 0.5 K/at. %. These values are consistent with the lack of observation of an anomaly and the enhancement of \(T_{c}\) to 5.8 K for 5 at. % Sc substitution for Lu. Thus, from the view of volume change, the effect of impurity is at least six times more sensitive than that of pressure for suppressing the CDW transition in this system. This also provides information that the impurity may induce a change in the band structure or density of states near the Fermi surface.

To investigate the electronic density of states near the Fermi level in Lu\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\), we vary the Fermi level slightly by the impurity doping and measure the temperature dependence of the resistivity. Os and Pt, which are different from Ir by only one in the atomic number, are chosen as dopants in order to minimize the lattice distortion due to the substitutional disorder. We also use Co as a dopant that is isoelectronic to Ir. Normalized-resistivity data as a function of temperature between 60 and 90 K for pure Lu\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) and Lu\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) doped with 0.5 at. % Co, Os, and Pt are shown in Fig. 6. It is found that Os doping is more effective than Pt doping in suppressing the anomaly as measured by the jump in the transition temperature and the resistivity. However, the superconducting transition does not change in a complementary manner. For both the Os- and Pt-doped samples, \(T_{c}\) increases as \(T_{0}\) decreases, as expected; however, \(T_{c}\) increases more for the Pt-containing compound, which is not consistent with what we observe in the (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{x}\)Si\({}_{10}\) system. This inconsistency indicates that size effects, which also occur during doping, may be as important as the electronic effects. The reduction of \(T_{0}\) when isoelectronic Co is substituted for Ir is larger than with Os or Pt substituting for Ir, confirming the importance of size effects.

  It will be interesting to understand the superconducting properties of Lu\({}_{3}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) under higher pressure compared with those at ambient pressure. Instead of measuring the heat capacity and static magnetic susceptibility under high pressure, we used two pseudoternary samples (Lu\({}_{0.98}\)Se\({}_{0.02}\))\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) and Lu\({}_{5}\)(Ir\({}_{0.78}\)Rh\({}_{0.22}\))\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) to study the upper critical field. The former is strongly enhanced in \(T_{c}\) (\(\Delta T_{c}\!\!\sim\!\!\) 2 K) at a very low Sc concentration, while the latter has the highest \(T_{c}\) in its pseudoternary system. The upper critical fields for (Lu\({}_{0.98}\)Se\({}_{0.02}\))\({}_{3}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) and Lu\({}_{5}\)(Ir\({}_{0.78}\)Rh\({}_{0.22}\))\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\), as well as those for the end members Sc\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\), Lu\({}_{3}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\), and Lu\({}_{5}\)Rh\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\),[9] are shown in Fig. 7. The data were analyzed with use of the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg-Maki (WHHM) theory[10][12][13] in the dirty limit[13] (short mean free path) so that

\[\alpha\!=\!5.28\!\times\!10^{-5}\left[-\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}\right]_{T\!=\!T_{c}},\] (1)

\[\left[-\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}\right]_{T\!=\!T_{c}}\!=\!4.48\!\times\!10^{4}\gamma_ {\rm cal}\rho_{\rm res}\ ,\] (2)

where the Maki parameter \(\alpha\) is in units of Oe/K, \(\gamma_{\rm cal}\) is the calculated electronic contribution to the normal-state heat capacity in units of erg/cm\({}^{3}\) K\({}^{2}\), and \(\rho_{\rm res}\) is the residual resistivity in units of \(\Omega\) cm. The values at \(T\!=\!0\) K of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) coherence length \(\xi_{\rm GL}\), the GL penetration depth \(\lambda_{\rm GL}\), and GL parameter \(\kappa\) were calculated (in units of cm) by the following relations[11]:

\[\xi_{\rm GL} \!\!=\!8.57\!\times\!10^{-7}(\gamma_{\rm cal}\rho_{\rm res}T_{c})^ {-1/2}(1\!-\!t)^{-1/2}\ ,\] (3) \[\lambda_{\rm GL} \!\!=\!6.42\!\times\!10^{-3}\left[\frac{\rho_{\rm res}}{T_{c}} \right]^{-1/2}(1\!-\!t)^{-1/2}\ ,\] (4) \[\kappa_{\rm GL} \!\!=\!7.49\!\times\!10^{3}\gamma_{\rm cal}^{1/2}\rho_{\rm res}\ ,\] (5)

where \(t\!=\!T/T_{c}\). The results are listed in Table 2.

For (Lu\({}_{0.98}\)Se\({}_{0.02}\))\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\), the \(H_{c2}(0)\), \(-(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T\!=\!T_{c}}\), and \(\gamma_{\rm cal}\) are larger than those of the two end members. So, the enhancement of \(T_{c}\) is mainly due to the enhancement in the electronic density states at Fermi level. For Lu\({}_{5}\)(Ir\({}_{0.78}\)Rh\({}_{0.22}\))\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\), even though \(T_{c}\), \(H_{c2}(0)\), and \(-(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T\!=\!T_{c}}\) are larger than those of two end members, \(\gamma_{\rm cal}\) and \(\xi_{\rm GL}\) are smaller than those of Lu\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) due to the bigger \(\rho_{\rm res}\) caused by the comparable atomic-disorder effects. Thus the enhancement of \(T_{c}\) may be caused by an enhancement of the electron-phonon interaction.

## IV Conclusion

Our experiments reveal that the CDW formation in these compounds is highly sensitive to atomic disorder. The doping effects maintain the correlation between \(T_{c}\) and \(T_{0}\). These results for the pseudoternary systems (Lu\({}_{1-x}\)Sc\({}_{x}\))\({}_{5}\)Ir\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) and Lu\({}_{5}\)(Ir\({}_{1-x}\)Rh\({}_{x}\))\({}_{4}\)Si\({}_{10}\) are very similar to those of other CDW systems such as \(1T\)-TaS\({}_{2}\)[14], (Ti\({}_{1-x}\)V\({}_{x}\))Se\({}_{2}\)[15], (Ta\({}_{1-x}\)Nb\({}_{x}\))S\({}_{3}\)[16], and \(2H\)-TaS\({}_{2}\)[17].
