###### Abstract

We have investigated the upper critical field anisotropy and magnetotransport properties of Fe1.14(1)Te0.91(2)S0.09(2) single crystals in stable magnetic fields up to 35 T. The results show that m0_H_c2(_T_) along the c axis and in the _ab_ plane exhibit saturation at low temperatures. The anisotropy of m0_H_c2(_T_) decreases with decreasing temperature, becoming nearly isotropic for T - 0. Our analysis indicates that the spin-paramagnetic pair breaking with spin-orbital scattering is responsible for the behavior of m0_H_c2(_T_). Furthermore, from analysis of the normal-state properties, we show evidence that the excess Fe is a key factor determining the normal- and superconducting-state physical properties.

## I Introduction

Iron-based superconductors have generated a great deal of interests due to exotic physical and chemical properties such as high transition temperature T_{c} (above 50 K) in layered structure without copper oxygen planes, spin-fluctuation spectrum dominated by two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate excitations comparable to high-_T__c_ cuprates and multi-orbital physics with active spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Simple binary FeSe_{x}, Fe(Te1-xSe)_{z}, and Fe1+y(Te1-xSe)_{z} (Refs. [8, 9, 10]) share common characteristics with other iron-based superconductors: a square-planar lattice of Fe with tetrahedral coordination and similar Fermi-surface topology.[11] On the other hand, they exhibit some distinctive features such as the absence of charge reservoir, significant pressure effect,[12] and strongly magnetic excess Fe in Fe(2) site providing local moments that are expected to persist even if the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by doping or pressure.[13] Furthermore, superconductivity in Fe1+y(Te1-xS)_{z} develops from nonmetallic conductivity which is different from metallic resistivity above T_{c} in all other iron-based superconductors.[10, 14]

There are two remarkable common characteristics in m0_H_c2-_T_ phase diagram of iron-based superconductors. In ternary and quaternary iron-pnictide superconductors (122 and 1111 systems), m0_H_c2,_(_T_) shows pronounced upturn or positive temperature curvature far below T_{c} without saturation. In contrast, m0_H_c2,_ab_(_T_) exhibits a downturn curvature with decreasing temperature.[15, 16] The former can be explained by two-band theory with high (1111) or low (122 systems) intraband diffusivity ratio of electron band to hole band and the latter is commonly ascribed to the spin-paramagnetic effect.[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

Here we report comprehensive study of the upper critical-field anisotropy and magnetotransport properties of Fe1.14(1)Te0.91(2)S0.09(2), single crystals in stable magnetic fields up to 35 T. We observe that enhanced spin-paramagnetic effect is dominant in both m0_H_c2,_c_(_T_) and m0_H_c2,_ab_(_T_). We conclude that the root cause of that enhancement and the anomalous normal-state electronic-transport properties is the existence of excess Fe(2) iron. As opposed to 122 and 1111 iron-pnictide superconductors derived from stoichiometric Ba(Sr)Fe2As2 and LaOFeAs parent compounds, the width of material formation and subtle iron stoichiometry is rather important in superconductors derived from Fe1+yTe.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Fe(Te,S) were grown by self-flux method and their crystal structure was analyzed in the previous report.[14] The elemental and microstructure analysis on particular crystal used in this study showed Fe1.14(1)(Te0.91(2)S0.09(2))_{z} stoichiometry and will be denoted as S-09 in the following for brevity. Electrical-transport measurements were performed using a four-probe configuration with current flowing in the _ab_ plane of tetragonal structure in dc magnetic fields up to 9 T in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS-9) from 1.8 to 200 K and up to 35 T in an Oxford Heliox cryostat with resistive magnet down to 0.3 K at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, FL.

## III Results and Discussions

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the temperature-dependent _ab_-plane electrical resistivity _pa_b(_T_) of S-09 below 15 K in magnetic fields from 0 to 9 T for _H_\parallel_ab_ and _H_\parallel_c_. With increasing magnetic fields, the resistivity transition widths are slightly broader. The onset of superconductivity shifts to lower temperatures gradually for both magnetic field directions but the trend is more obvious for _H_\parallel_c_ than _H_\parallel_ab_. The shape and broadening of _r_ab(_T_) for _H_\parallel_c_ is comparable to 122 system[21] but quite different from 1111 system[18] where it was explained by the vortex-liquid state similar to cuprates.[22, 23, 24] Hence, it can be concluded that the vortex-liquid state region is narrower or even absent in S-09. This is similar to Fe1+y(Te1-xSe)_{z}.[25]

The upper critical field m0_H_c2(_T_) corresponding to temperatures where the resistivity drops to 90%, 50%, and 10% of the normal-state resistivity _pa_b,_ab_(_T_,_H_)(_T_,c,_onset_) is shown in Fig. 1(c). The normal-state resistivity _pa_b,_ab_(_H_,_T_) was deter mined by linearly extrapolating the normal-state behavior above the onset of superconductivity in \rho_{ab}(T) curves [same as for \rho_{ab}(H) curves]. The slope of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T_{c}) obtained from linear fitting the curves of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} for all defined temperatures are listed in Table I. The values of orbital pair-breaking field \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(0) corresponding to the conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory[26]\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(0) = - 0.693(d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}T_{c} are also listed in Table I.

Superconductivity is suppressed by increasing magnetic field up to 35 T and the transition of \rho_{ab}(H) curves are shifted to lower magnetic fields at higher measuring temperature [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)]. At 0.3 K, the lowest temperature of our measurement we observe no superconductivity up to 35 T for both crystallographic directions, indicating that the upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) of Fe_{1+\gamma}(Te_{1-\text{s}}S_{\nu}), with same doping level is lower than that of Fe_{1+\gamma}(Te_{1-\text{s}}Se_{\nu})_{z}[25]. Figure 2(c) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity at high magnetic fields. The superconductivity above 0.3 K is suppressed when \mu_{0}H=35 T, irrespective of the direction of field, consistent with the results of \rho_{ab}(H) measurement. The superconducting transition widths are only slightly broader even at 20 T, indicating that the vortex-liquid state in S-09 is narrow not only in low-field high temperature but also in high-field low-temperature region.

From the results of \rho_{ab}(H) and \rho_{ab}(T) at low and high field, we construct the \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)-T phase diagram [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. There is a linear increase in \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) with decreasing temperature near T_{c} and a saturation trend away from T_{c} irrespective of field direction, similar to Fe_{1+\gamma}(Te_{1-\text{s}}Se_{\nu})_{z}[25]. This is different from 1111 and 122 system, which exhibit upturn or linear behavior at low temperature for \mu_{0}H_{c2,c}(T) ascribed to two-band effect [15, 16]. The \mu_{0}H_{c2,onset}(0) is about 28 T for both field directions. This is much smaller than the values predicted by WHH formalism with only considering orbital pair-breaking effect [Table I, Fig. 3(c) black lines].

  In what follows we consider the contribution of spin-paramagnetic effect and its origin. Only the \mu_{0}H_{c2,onset}(T) were chosen for further analysis.[16, 27] The effects of Pauli-spin paramagnetism and spin-orbit scattering were included in the WHH theory through the Maki parameters \alpha and \lambda_{so}.[26, 28] We found it necessary to introduce \lambda_{so}  0 in \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) fits, unlike for Fe1+\gamma(Te1-\gammaSe3)_{z}.[25, 27] The results [Fig. 3(c)] indicate that the spin-paramagnetic effect is the dominant pair-breaking mechanism in S-09 for both H\|ab and H\|c. The calculated zero-temperature Pauli-limited field[28]H_{p}(0) = \sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{\ast}(0)/\alpha using \alpha obtained from \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) fits and zero-temperature coherence length \xi(0) estimated with Ginzburg-Landau formula \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = \Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi(0) (where \Phi_{0} = 2.07 x 10-15 Wb) are listed in Table II. The \mu_{0}H_{p}(0) is smaller than \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) due to the large value of \alpha. Since Fe1+\gammaTe1-\gammaS_{z} superconductors are in the dirty limit,[29] the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state at high fields is unlikely because short mean-free path will remove any momentum anisotropy.[30, 31] The two-band theory,[32] which is applicable to the 1111 system, did not yield satisfactory fits (not shown here).

Temperature dependence of anisotropy of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T), \gamma[ =H_{c2,ab}(T)/H_{c2,c}(T)], is shown in Fig. 3(d) as a function of temperature T. The value of \gamma for S-09 is smaller than that of Fe1+\gamma(Te1-\gammaSe3)_{z} at high temperature [25, 33] and it decreases gradually to 1 with decreasing temperature. Values of \gamma decrease to less than 1 below T = 1 K, which has also been observed in Fe1+\gamma(Te0.6Se0.4)_{z}.[25, 33]

Why are there large Maki parameter \alpha and nonzero \lambda_{so}? First, the Maki parameter can be enhanced due to disorder.[27, 34] In this system, disorder can be induced by Te(S) substitution/vacancies and excess Fe in Fe(2) site, resulting in the enhancement of spin-paramagnetic effect. Second, according to the expression of \mu_{0}H_{p}(0) with strong-coupling correction considering electron-boson and electron-electron interaction:[27, 35, 36]\mu_{0}H_{p}(0) = 1.86(1 + \lambda)^{\varepsilon}\eta_{\lambda}\eta_{\beta}(1 - I), where \eta_{\lambda} describes the strong-coupling intraband correction for the gap, I is the Stoner factor I = N(E_{F})J, N(E_{F}) is the electronic density of states per spin at the Fermi energy level E_{F}, J is an effective exchange integral, \eta_{\beta} is introduced to describe phenomenologically the effect of the gap anisotropy, \lambda is electron-boson coupling constant, and \varepsilon = 0.5 or 1. Since the N(E_{F}) of FeS is larger than that of FeSe,[11] it is likely that the N(E_{F}) of Fe1+\gamma(Te1-\gammaSe3)_{z} is larger than that of Fe1+\gamma(Te1-\gammaSe3)_{z} with same doping content, which will lead to the larger \alpha. It is consistent with the previous reported result.[25] Third, \mu_{0}H_{p}(0) can be decreased, i.e., larger \alpha, if the Stoner factor increases via enhancement of J by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between local magnetic moments of Fe(2) with itinerant electrons. We expect low content of S doping to have small effect on high N(E_{F}).[11, 13] On the other hand, large \lambda_{so} can also be explained via increasing Kondo-type scattering from excess Fe, consistent with the definition of \lambda_{so}, which is proportional to the spin-flip scattering rate.[26, 28]

In the next section, we study the normal-state properties systematically. Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of \rho_{ab}(T) in zero field from 1.8 to 300 K. As seen from the data, S-09 exhibits a nonmetallic resistivity behavior in normal state, in agreement with measurements on polycrystals.[10] Similar behavior has also been observed in FeTe with low Se-content doping,[9, 37, 38] ascribed to 2D weak localization.[38] However, our analysis indicates that \rho_{ab}(T) can originate from Kondo-type scattering. It can be seen that the normal-state resistivity at zero field satisfies Hamann's equation perfectly [Fig. 4(a)]: \rho = \rho_{imp} + \rho_{0}[1 - ln(T/T_{K})/{{\{[\ln^{2}(T/T_{K}) + \pi^{2}S(S + 1)\}^{1/2}\rbrack}}, where \rho_{imp} is an temperature-independent impurity scattering resistivity, \rho_{0} is proportional to the concentration of the local magnetic moment, T_{K} is Kondo temperature, and S is set as 1/2.[39] The fitted parameters are \rho_{imp} = 0.76(1) mJ cm, \rho_{0} =0.54(1) mJ cm, and T_{K} =24.3(4) K. Inset of Fig. 4(a) shows the region at low temperature, where it can be seen

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c c c} \mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}^{\ast}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{c2,c}^{\ast}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{p,ab}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{p,c}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{c2,c}(0) & & & & \xi_{ab}(0) & \xi_{c}(0) \\ (  that Hamann's equation is valid approximately down to temperatures _T_~_T__K_. It should be noted that after deducting the magnetoresistance, the normal-state resistivity at m0_H_ = 35 T still increases with decreasing temperature for both field directions, showing saturation trend as expected for _r_(_T_) of diluted impurities below T_{K}. [40] This behavior is an important distinction from the metallic resistivity above T_{C} in 1111 and 122 systems, even FeSea (Refs. [8, 15, and 16]) because these systems do not contain excess Fe with local moment. We note that D_{r}  t was observed in a particle irradiated Nd(O,F)FeAs single crystals due to Kondo-type scattering on the magnetic moments of irradiation defects. [41] This effect could also contribute to r  _ln_ T dependence in S-09 due to possible defects on Te(S) site. [14]

On the other hand, negative magnetoresistance (NMR) in the normal state [Fig. 4(b)] further suggests the effect of excess Fe. NMR observed in S-09 is rather unusual when compared to other iron-based superconductors, such as 1111 and 122 systems where positive MR violates Kohler scaling due to multiband effects or the depletion of density of states at the Fermi surface with temperature change. [42] Observed NMR is most likely ascribed to suppressing incoherent Kondo spin-flip scattering, which has been intensively studied in dilute alloy systems. [43] The absolute values of MR increase with increasing field at the constant temperature and the MR effect is weaker with the temperature increase. Moreover, the MR effect is more pronounced for _H_|_ab_ than for _H_|_c_. Similar NMR have been seen in excess iron-doped TaSe2 and ascribed to Kondo-type scattering. [44]

Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show the magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity _r__{\text{xy}} and R_{H} determined from the slope of Hall resistivity _r__{\text{xy}}(_H_) at different temperatures. The positive R_{H} above T_{C} indicates that the electronic transport is dominated by hole-type carriers. We observe no abrupt change in carrier density at the temperature of magnetic transition. [14] This is consistent with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and optical spectroscopy observations, implying that there is no gap at the Fermi surface below the magnetic transition. There is strong temperature dependence of R_{H} that increases continuously with increasing temperature. The R_{H} bending at low temperatures can be ascribed to skew scattering. [45] The combined influence of ordinary Hall effect R0 and skew scattering due to Kondo-type scattering is expected to follow R_{H}(_T_) = R0 + _A_/(_T_ - ) dependence where Th characterizes the strength of exchange interaction between local moments. We obtained excellent fitting results [solid line in Fig. 4(d)]. The value of Th is -57.9(1) K, which indicates that the exchange interaction between Fe is antiferromagnetic. The similar behavior has also been observed in other iron-based systems was explained by localization behavior induced by disorder, multiband effects or partial gaping Fermi surface with decreasing temperature. [38, 46, 47] Furthermore, using the obtained R_{H}(_T_ = 0) = 3.02 x 10-8 m3/C, i.e., the zero-temperature carrier concentration n = 2.07 x 1020 cm-3, and obtained residual resistivity r0 = 1.84 m\Omega cm from the Hamann's equation, we can evaluate the mean-free path of S-09, l = 1.35 nm using Drude model l = _l_(3 \pi2)13/(_e_2_0n2). This confirms that S-09 is a dirty-limit superconductor since _l_/(0) = 0.396.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, the anisotropy in the upper critical field of Fe1,14(1)(Te0.91(2)S0.09(2))_z_ single crystals was studied in high and stable magnetic fields up to 35 T. We found that the zero-temperature upper critical field is much smaller than the predicted result of WHH theory without the spin-paramagnetic effect. The anisotropy of the upper critical field decreases with decreasing temperature, becoming nearly isotopic at low temperature. The spin-paramagnetic effect is

Inset of (a) shows the _ρ_ab_(_T_) at 0 and 35 T for _H_|_ab_ and _H_|_c_ (deducting the MR effects) at low temperature.

  the dominant pair-breaking mechanism for both H||ab and H||c crystallographic axes. There is obvious spin-orbital scattering effect in this system. Our results show no abrupt change in the carrier density at the temperature of magnetic transition and considerable Kondo-type scattering effects on resistivity, MR, and Hall properties. All of these results indicate that the excess Fe in Fe(2) site act as Kondo-type impurities and play a key role in the exotic normal- and superconducting-state properties.

###### Abstract

We have investigated the upper critical field anisotropy and magnetotransport properties of Fe1.14(1)Te0.91(2)S0.09(2) single crystals in stable magnetic fields up to 35 T. The results show that m0_H_c2(_T_) along the c axis and in the _ab_ plane exhibit saturation at low temperatures. The anisotropy of m0_H_c2(_T_) decreases with decreasing temperature, becoming nearly isotropic for T - 0. Our analysis indicates that the spin-paramagnetic pair breaking with spin-orbital scattering is responsible for the behavior of m0_H_c2(_T_). Furthermore, from analysis of the normal-state properties, we show evidence that the excess Fe is a key factor determining the normal- and superconducting-state physical properties.

## I Introduction

Iron-based superconductors have generated a great deal of interests due to exotic physical and chemical properties such as high transition temperature T_{c} (above 50 K) in layered structure without copper oxygen planes, spin-fluctuation spectrum dominated by two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate excitations comparable to high-_T__c_ cuprates and multi-orbital physics with active spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Simple binary FeSe_{x}, Fe(Te1-xSe)_{z}, and Fe1+y(Te1-xSe)_{z} (Refs. [8, 9, 10]) share common characteristics with other iron-based superconductors: a square-planar lattice of Fe with tetrahedral coordination and similar Fermi-surface topology.[11] On the other hand, they exhibit some distinctive features such as the absence of charge reservoir, significant pressure effect,[12] and strongly magnetic excess Fe in Fe(2) site providing local moments that are expected to persist even if the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed by doping or pressure.[13] Furthermore, superconductivity in Fe1+y(Te1-xS)_{z} develops from nonmetallic conductivity which is different from metallic resistivity above T_{c} in all other iron-based superconductors.[10, 14]

There are two remarkable common characteristics in m0_H_c2-_T_ phase diagram of iron-based superconductors. In ternary and quaternary iron-pnictide superconductors (122 and 1111 systems), m0_H_c2,_(_T_) shows pronounced upturn or positive temperature curvature far below T_{c} without saturation. In contrast, m0_H_c2,_ab_(_T_) exhibits a downturn curvature with decreasing temperature.[15, 16] The former can be explained by two-band theory with high (1111) or low (122 systems) intraband diffusivity ratio of electron band to hole band and the latter is commonly ascribed to the spin-paramagnetic effect.[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

Here we report comprehensive study of the upper critical-field anisotropy and magnetotransport properties of Fe1.14(1)Te0.91(2)S0.09(2), single crystals in stable magnetic fields up to 35 T. We observe that enhanced spin-paramagnetic effect is dominant in both m0_H_c2,_c_(_T_) and m0_H_c2,_ab_(_T_). We conclude that the root cause of that enhancement and the anomalous normal-state electronic-transport properties is the existence of excess Fe(2) iron. As opposed to 122 and 1111 iron-pnictide superconductors derived from stoichiometric Ba(Sr)Fe2As2 and LaOFeAs parent compounds, the width of material formation and subtle iron stoichiometry is rather important in superconductors derived from Fe1+yTe.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of Fe(Te,S) were grown by self-flux method and their crystal structure was analyzed in the previous report.[14] The elemental and microstructure analysis on particular crystal used in this study showed Fe1.14(1)(Te0.91(2)S0.09(2))_{z} stoichiometry and will be denoted as S-09 in the following for brevity. Electrical-transport measurements were performed using a four-probe configuration with current flowing in the _ab_ plane of tetragonal structure in dc magnetic fields up to 9 T in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS-9) from 1.8 to 200 K and up to 35 T in an Oxford Heliox cryostat with resistive magnet down to 0.3 K at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, FL.

## III Results and Discussions

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the temperature-dependent _ab_-plane electrical resistivity _pa_b(_T_) of S-09 below 15 K in magnetic fields from 0 to 9 T for _H_\parallel_ab_ and _H_\parallel_c_. With increasing magnetic fields, the resistivity transition widths are slightly broader. The onset of superconductivity shifts to lower temperatures gradually for both magnetic field directions but the trend is more obvious for _H_\parallel_c_ than _H_\parallel_ab_. The shape and broadening of _r_ab(_T_) for _H_\parallel_c_ is comparable to 122 system[21] but quite different from 1111 system[18] where it was explained by the vortex-liquid state similar to cuprates.[22, 23, 24] Hence, it can be concluded that the vortex-liquid state region is narrower or even absent in S-09. This is similar to Fe1+y(Te1-xSe)_{z}.[25]

The upper critical field m0_H_c2(_T_) corresponding to temperatures where the resistivity drops to 90%, 50%, and 10% of the normal-state resistivity _pa_b,_ab_(_T_,_H_)(_T_,c,_onset_) is shown in Fig. 1(c). The normal-state resistivity _pa_b,_ab_(_H_,_T_) was deter mined by linearly extrapolating the normal-state behavior above the onset of superconductivity in \rho_{ab}(T) curves [same as for \rho_{ab}(H) curves]. The slope of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T_{c}) obtained from linear fitting the curves of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) near T_{c} for all defined temperatures are listed in Table I. The values of orbital pair-breaking field \mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(0) corresponding to the conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory[26]\mu_{0}H_{c2}^{*}(0) = - 0.693(d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}T_{c} are also listed in Table I.

Superconductivity is suppressed by increasing magnetic field up to 35 T and the transition of \rho_{ab}(H) curves are shifted to lower magnetic fields at higher measuring temperature [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)]. At 0.3 K, the lowest temperature of our measurement we observe no superconductivity up to 35 T for both crystallographic directions, indicating that the upper critical field \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) of Fe_{1+\gamma}(Te_{1-\text{s}}S_{\nu}), with same doping level is lower than that of Fe_{1+\gamma}(Te_{1-\text{s}}Se_{\nu})_{z}[25]. Figure 2(c) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity at high magnetic fields. The superconductivity above 0.3 K is suppressed when \mu_{0}H=35 T, irrespective of the direction of field, consistent with the results of \rho_{ab}(H) measurement. The superconducting transition widths are only slightly broader even at 20 T, indicating that the vortex-liquid state in S-09 is narrow not only in low-field high temperature but also in high-field low-temperature region.

From the results of \rho_{ab}(H) and \rho_{ab}(T) at low and high field, we construct the \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)-T phase diagram [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. There is a linear increase in \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) with decreasing temperature near T_{c} and a saturation trend away from T_{c} irrespective of field direction, similar to Fe_{1+\gamma}(Te_{1-\text{s}}Se_{\nu})_{z}[25]. This is different from 1111 and 122 system, which exhibit upturn or linear behavior at low temperature for \mu_{0}H_{c2,c}(T) ascribed to two-band effect [15, 16]. The \mu_{0}H_{c2,onset}(0) is about 28 T for both field directions. This is much smaller than the values predicted by WHH formalism with only considering orbital pair-breaking effect [Table I, Fig. 3(c) black lines].

  In what follows we consider the contribution of spin-paramagnetic effect and its origin. Only the \mu_{0}H_{c2,onset}(T) were chosen for further analysis.[16, 27] The effects of Pauli-spin paramagnetism and spin-orbit scattering were included in the WHH theory through the Maki parameters \alpha and \lambda_{so}.[26, 28] We found it necessary to introduce \lambda_{so}  0 in \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) fits, unlike for Fe1+\gamma(Te1-\gammaSe3)_{z}.[25, 27] The results [Fig. 3(c)] indicate that the spin-paramagnetic effect is the dominant pair-breaking mechanism in S-09 for both H\|ab and H\|c. The calculated zero-temperature Pauli-limited field[28]H_{p}(0) = \sqrt{2}H_{c2}^{\ast}(0)/\alpha using \alpha obtained from \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T) fits and zero-temperature coherence length \xi(0) estimated with Ginzburg-Landau formula \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) = \Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi(0) (where \Phi_{0} = 2.07 x 10-15 Wb) are listed in Table II. The \mu_{0}H_{p}(0) is smaller than \mu_{0}H_{c2}(0) due to the large value of \alpha. Since Fe1+\gammaTe1-\gammaS_{z} superconductors are in the dirty limit,[29] the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state at high fields is unlikely because short mean-free path will remove any momentum anisotropy.[30, 31] The two-band theory,[32] which is applicable to the 1111 system, did not yield satisfactory fits (not shown here).

Temperature dependence of anisotropy of \mu_{0}H_{c2}(T), \gamma[ =H_{c2,ab}(T)/H_{c2,c}(T)], is shown in Fig. 3(d) as a function of temperature T. The value of \gamma for S-09 is smaller than that of Fe1+\gamma(Te1-\gammaSe3)_{z} at high temperature [25, 33] and it decreases gradually to 1 with decreasing temperature. Values of \gamma decrease to less than 1 below T = 1 K, which has also been observed in Fe1+\gamma(Te0.6Se0.4)_{z}.[25, 33]

Why are there large Maki parameter \alpha and nonzero \lambda_{so}? First, the Maki parameter can be enhanced due to disorder.[27, 34] In this system, disorder can be induced by Te(S) substitution/vacancies and excess Fe in Fe(2) site, resulting in the enhancement of spin-paramagnetic effect. Second, according to the expression of \mu_{0}H_{p}(0) with strong-coupling correction considering electron-boson and electron-electron interaction:[27, 35, 36]\mu_{0}H_{p}(0) = 1.86(1 + \lambda)^{\varepsilon}\eta_{\lambda}\eta_{\beta}(1 - I), where \eta_{\lambda} describes the strong-coupling intraband correction for the gap, I is the Stoner factor I = N(E_{F})J, N(E_{F}) is the electronic density of states per spin at the Fermi energy level E_{F}, J is an effective exchange integral, \eta_{\beta} is introduced to describe phenomenologically the effect of the gap anisotropy, \lambda is electron-boson coupling constant, and \varepsilon = 0.5 or 1. Since the N(E_{F}) of FeS is larger than that of FeSe,[11] it is likely that the N(E_{F}) of Fe1+\gamma(Te1-\gammaSe3)_{z} is larger than that of Fe1+\gamma(Te1-\gammaSe3)_{z} with same doping content, which will lead to the larger \alpha. It is consistent with the previous reported result.[25] Third, \mu_{0}H_{p}(0) can be decreased, i.e., larger \alpha, if the Stoner factor increases via enhancement of J by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between local magnetic moments of Fe(2) with itinerant electrons. We expect low content of S doping to have small effect on high N(E_{F}).[11, 13] On the other hand, large \lambda_{so} can also be explained via increasing Kondo-type scattering from excess Fe, consistent with the definition of \lambda_{so}, which is proportional to the spin-flip scattering rate.[26, 28]

In the next section, we study the normal-state properties systematically. Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of \rho_{ab}(T) in zero field from 1.8 to 300 K. As seen from the data, S-09 exhibits a nonmetallic resistivity behavior in normal state, in agreement with measurements on polycrystals.[10] Similar behavior has also been observed in FeTe with low Se-content doping,[9, 37, 38] ascribed to 2D weak localization.[38] However, our analysis indicates that \rho_{ab}(T) can originate from Kondo-type scattering. It can be seen that the normal-state resistivity at zero field satisfies Hamann's equation perfectly [Fig. 4(a)]: \rho = \rho_{imp} + \rho_{0}[1 - ln(T/T_{K})/{{\{[\ln^{2}(T/T_{K}) + \pi^{2}S(S + 1)\}^{1/2}\rbrack}}, where \rho_{imp} is an temperature-independent impurity scattering resistivity, \rho_{0} is proportional to the concentration of the local magnetic moment, T_{K} is Kondo temperature, and S is set as 1/2.[39] The fitted parameters are \rho_{imp} = 0.76(1) mJ cm, \rho_{0} =0.54(1) mJ cm, and T_{K} =24.3(4) K. Inset of Fig. 4(a) shows the region at low temperature, where it can be seen

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c c c} \mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}^{\ast}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{c2,c}^{\ast}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{p,ab}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{p,c}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{c2,ab}(0) & \mu_{0}H_{c2,c}(0) & & & & \xi_{ab}(0) & \xi_{c}(0) \\ (  that Hamann's equation is valid approximately down to temperatures _T_~_T__K_. It should be noted that after deducting the magnetoresistance, the normal-state resistivity at m0_H_ = 35 T still increases with decreasing temperature for both field directions, showing saturation trend as expected for _r_(_T_) of diluted impurities below T_{K}. [40] This behavior is an important distinction from the metallic resistivity above T_{C} in 1111 and 122 systems, even FeSea (Refs. [8, 15, and 16]) because these systems do not contain excess Fe with local moment. We note that D_{r}  t was observed in a particle irradiated Nd(O,F)FeAs single crystals due to Kondo-type scattering on the magnetic moments of irradiation defects. [41] This effect could also contribute to r  _ln_ T dependence in S-09 due to possible defects on Te(S) site. [14]

On the other hand, negative magnetoresistance (NMR) in the normal state [Fig. 4(b)] further suggests the effect of excess Fe. NMR observed in S-09 is rather unusual when compared to other iron-based superconductors, such as 1111 and 122 systems where positive MR violates Kohler scaling due to multiband effects or the depletion of density of states at the Fermi surface with temperature change. [42] Observed NMR is most likely ascribed to suppressing incoherent Kondo spin-flip scattering, which has been intensively studied in dilute alloy systems. [43] The absolute values of MR increase with increasing field at the constant temperature and the MR effect is weaker with the temperature increase. Moreover, the MR effect is more pronounced for _H_|_ab_ than for _H_|_c_. Similar NMR have been seen in excess iron-doped TaSe2 and ascribed to Kondo-type scattering. [44]

Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show the magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity _r__{\text{xy}} and R_{H} determined from the slope of Hall resistivity _r__{\text{xy}}(_H_) at different temperatures. The positive R_{H} above T_{C} indicates that the electronic transport is dominated by hole-type carriers. We observe no abrupt change in carrier density at the temperature of magnetic transition. [14] This is consistent with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and optical spectroscopy observations, implying that there is no gap at the Fermi surface below the magnetic transition. There is strong temperature dependence of R_{H} that increases continuously with increasing temperature. The R_{H} bending at low temperatures can be ascribed to skew scattering. [45] The combined influence of ordinary Hall effect R0 and skew scattering due to Kondo-type scattering is expected to follow R_{H}(_T_) = R0 + _A_/(_T_ - ) dependence where Th characterizes the strength of exchange interaction between local moments. We obtained excellent fitting results [solid line in Fig. 4(d)]. The value of Th is -57.9(1) K, which indicates that the exchange interaction between Fe is antiferromagnetic. The similar behavior has also been observed in other iron-based systems was explained by localization behavior induced by disorder, multiband effects or partial gaping Fermi surface with decreasing temperature. [38, 46, 47] Furthermore, using the obtained R_{H}(_T_ = 0) = 3.02 x 10-8 m3/C, i.e., the zero-temperature carrier concentration n = 2.07 x 1020 cm-3, and obtained residual resistivity r0 = 1.84 m\Omega cm from the Hamann's equation, we can evaluate the mean-free path of S-09, l = 1.35 nm using Drude model l = _l_(3 \pi2)13/(_e_2_0n2). This confirms that S-09 is a dirty-limit superconductor since _l_/(0) = 0.396.

## IV Conclusion

In summary, the anisotropy in the upper critical field of Fe1,14(1)(Te0.91(2)S0.09(2))_z_ single crystals was studied in high and stable magnetic fields up to 35 T. We found that the zero-temperature upper critical field is much smaller than the predicted result of WHH theory without the spin-paramagnetic effect. The anisotropy of the upper critical field decreases with decreasing temperature, becoming nearly isotopic at low temperature. The spin-paramagnetic effect is

Inset of (a) shows the _ρ_ab_(_T_) at 0 and 35 T for _H_|_ab_ and _H_|_c_ (deducting the MR effects) at low temperature.

  the dominant pair-breaking mechanism for both H||ab and H||c crystallographic axes. There is obvious spin-orbital scattering effect in this system. Our results show no abrupt change in the carrier density at the temperature of magnetic transition and considerable Kondo-type scattering effects on resistivity, MR, and Hall properties. All of these results indicate that the excess Fe in Fe(2) site act as Kondo-type impurities and play a key role in the exotic normal- and superconducting-state properties.
