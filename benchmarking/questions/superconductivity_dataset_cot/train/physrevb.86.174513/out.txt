###### Abstract

We report on a study of the superconducting properties for a series of polycrystalline BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} filled skutterudite compounds for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. Muon spin rotation (_u_SR) spectroscopy as well as magnetization, specific-heat, and electrical resistivity measurements were performed. The magnetic penetration depth \lambda, the coherence length \xi, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa are evaluated. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density is well described by an _s_-wave superconducting gap and this classical scenario is supported by the field-independent \lambda. The gap-to-_T_{c}_ ratio \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}_ increases with the Au content from 1.70 for x = 0 to 2.1(1) for x = 1. By combining _u_SR, magnetization, and specific-heat data, we find that BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} compounds are in between the dirty and clean limits with mean free paths of the carriers l ~ \sim \xi. Interestingly, resistivity data for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} indicate a much higher upper critical field, which is probably due to defects or impurities close to the surface of the crystallites.

## 1 Introduction

Filled skutterudite compounds _MT_{4}X_{12}_ with a framework formed from T (Fe, Ru, Os) and X (P, As, Sb) atoms and "filled" with M atoms (rare-earth, alkaline-earth, or alkali metals) came in focus of recent research activities due to a number of unconventional phenomena.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] In their cubic crystal structure, the filler cations M reside in icosahedral cages formed by tilted _TX_{6}_ octahedra. The pronounced vibrational amplitudes of the M atoms have been linked to dynamic scattering mechanisms for heat-carrying acoustic phonons resulting in a reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a prerequisite for thermoelectric applications.[8] Several filled skutterudites display superconductivity and as well show a broad variety of other interesting phenomena.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

Recently, a new family of filled skutterudites based on a different framework of platinum and germanium with the chemical formula _M_Pt_{4}Ge_{12} has been discovered.[14, 15] Several of these compounds are superconducting (SC). The compositions with M = Sr and Ba (Refs. [14, 15] and [15]) have SC transition temperatures _T_c around 5 K and the later reported ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} is SC below 4.62 K.[16, 17] Due to a peak in the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy (_E_{F}_), LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} has a significantly higher _T_c of 8.3 K.[15] Interestingly, PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, with trivalent Pr in a nonmagnetic crystal field ground state, is also SC with an only slightly lower _T_c of 7.9 K. Its SC properties[18, 19] show some similarities with the heavy-fermion superconductivity of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] Most remarkably, an unconventional SC order parameter with point nodes and a rather similar gap-to-_T_{c}_ ratio has been observed. Moreover, signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking were found in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} by zero-field _u_SR.[19]

For LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, SrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, NMR and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) studies suggested an _s_-wave BCS SC state with \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.60.[23, 24, 25] Theoretical and experimental studies of the electronic structure of this class of skutterudites consistently show rather deep-lying Pt _5d_ states which only partially form covalent bands with Ge 4p electrons.[26] In turn, the electronic states at _E_{F}_ that are relevant for the SC behavior, can be firmly assigned to originate predominantly from Ge 4p electrons.[27] Different from _M_Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (_M_ = La, Pr) a pronounced peak in the DOS is located little above _E_{F}_ for SrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}.[28] Here, the low-lying Pt states open up the chance to influence the Fermi level in a rigid-band-like manner by a suitable substitution of Pt. By electron doping, the DOS and thus the SC _T_{c}_ of BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} could be systematically influenced through substitution of Pt by Au. The _T_{c}_ in the series BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} could be optimized to 7.0 K for x = 1.[28] For a doping with more than 1.0 extra electrons per formula unit a decrease of _T_{c}_ is expected.[28] Actually, the partial substitution of Au for Pt in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} leads to a continuous decrease of _T_{c}.[29]

Here, we report on a study of BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} compounds (_x_ = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) by means of transverse field (TF) muon-spin rotation (_u_SR) spectroscopy and macroscopic magnetization, specific-heat, and electrical resistivity measurements. High-quality _u_SR spectra of well-ordered SC flux-line lattices allowed us to use the exact solution of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for the analysis. The superfluid density (\rho_{s}) was found to saturate exponentially in the low-temperature limit, suggesting a SC gap without nodes, in agreement with a NMR study.[25] The temperature dependence of \rho_{s} is well described by the _s_-wave BCS function with the gap-to-_T_{c}_ ratios (\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}) of 1.70, 2.07, 2.15, and 2.02 for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively. This clear increase of \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} (viz., electron-phonon coupling) with x is in agreement with the results of our previous study.[28] The BCS character of the superconductivity is further supported by the field-independent magnetic penetration depth (\lambda). By combining _u_SR, magnetization, and specific-heat data we find that BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} compounds are in between the dirty and clean limits with mean free path of the carriers l ~ \sim \xi. In electrical resistivity measurements on BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} we observe superconductivity for fields much higher than the (bulk) upper critical field. This discrepancy appears especially for x = 0 samples and its origin is discussed in terms of the presence of chemical or crystallographic defects close to or on the surface of the crystallites.

 The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we give some experimental details, Sec. III describes the method of analysis of our \muSR data, and then we present and discuss the results from the \muSR as well as from the macroscopic methods. Our conclusions are given in Sec. IV. In Appendixes A and B we describe the details of our calculations and give the relevant GL definitions.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline samples of BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} with bulk T_{c} values of 4.9(1), 5.3(1), 6.25(5), and 6.95(5) K for x=0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively, were prepared as described in Refs. [15] and [28]. The SC transition temperatures T_{c} were determined from the onset of the Meissner flux expulsion (field cooling; tangent to the steepest slope and extrapolation to \chi=0) in magnetic susceptibility data measured in a nominal field of 2 mT (MPMS-XL7, Quantum Design).

The TF \muSR experiments were performed at the \piM3 and \muE1 beamlines at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen Switzerland) at the GPS, the LTF, and the GPD spectrometers. Each sample used for the \muSR study has an ellipsoidlike shape of a droplet with dimensions \simeq 7 \times 7 \times 4 mm^{3}, and therefore, field inhomogeneities due to demagnetization are negligible. The samples were field cooled from above T_{c} down to 1.6 K in a field of 50 mT and measured as a function of temperature (on the GPS spectrometer). Additional measurements were performed down to T\simeq 0.29 K (GPD spectrometer; ^{3}He cryostat) and T\simeq 0.03 K (LTF spectrometer; ^{3}He/^{4}He dilution cryostat) in an applied field of 50 mT. Measurements in a series of fields ranging from 10 to 640 mT at 1.7 K were also performed. Typical counting statistics were \approx 6 \times 10^{6} positron events per each data point.

Isothermal magnetization loops at 1.85 K were also recorded on the above mentioned magnetometer. In order to reduce demagnetization effects for these measurements, splinters of the samples were glued to a quartz capillary with their longest dimensions parallel to the field direction. Specific-heat capacity as well as electrical resistance measurements (ac, 93 Hz, current density j = 0.0072 A mm^{-2}) at T_{c} and up to 320 K were performed in magnetic fields up to 2.0 T in a measurement system (PPMS 9, Quantum Design).

## III Analysis, results, and discussion

### Muon spin rotation data

Figure 1 exhibits typical \muSR time spectra measured above and below T_{c} = 6.95 K in BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12}. The spectra of the other samples are similar. Negligibly small muon relaxations above the respective T_{c} are observed in all samples for the whole field range. A fit with the function A\cos(\gamma_{\mu}Bt+\phi)\exp(-1/2\sigma_{N}^{2}t^{2}) results in \sigma_{N}\leqslant 0.06\mus^{-1} (here, A, B, \phi, and \sigma_{N} are asymmetry, internal field, muon-spin phase, and relaxation rate, respectively). The relaxation rate \sigma_{N}< 0.06\mus^{-1} is mostly due to the nuclear magnetism of Ba, Pt, Au, and Ge isotopes, which causes a weak depolarization of the muon-spin ensemble. Below T_{c}, all samples exhibit relaxing \muSR asymmetry spectra due to the spatial variation of the internal field in the vortex-lattice state induced by the SC condensate. The FT of this signal directly shows the field distribution probed by the muon spins.

Figure 2 exhibits the FT spectra in BaPt_{3.5}Au_{0.5}Ge_{12} in a broad range of fields. The asymmetric character of the

Figure 2: (Color online) (a)-(f) Fourier transforms (FT) of the \muSR time spectra at 1.7 K in different applied magnetic fields \langle B\rangle= 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.45, and 0.64 T for BaPt_{3.5}Au_{0.5}Ge_{12} (corresponding reduced fields are b=\langle B\rangle/B_{c2} = 0.06, 0.12, 0.24, 0.36, 0.54, and 0.76). In this compound, fields close to B_{c2}(1.7 K) = 0.84(4) T are reachable. The solid lines are the FT of the fit curves with Eq. (2). The field-dependent spectra are well described by the field-independent parameters \lambda = 239(4) nm and \xi = 18.8(5) nm.

  vortex-lattice field distributions--reflecting the signatures of singularities at the minimum, saddle, and core fields--is clearly visible. Consequently, we analyzed the \muSR spectra for all BaPt_{1-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} samples using the exact solution of the GL equations with the method suggested by Brandt (see Appendix A).[30, 31] The spatial magnetic field distribution B({\bf r})=B({\bf r},\lambda,\xi,(B)) within the unit cell of the flux-line lattice (FLL) was obtained by minimization of Eq. (A1). From the obtained B({\bf r}) the probability field distribution for the ideal (defect-free) FLL P_{\rm{id}}(B) is calculated as follows:

\[P_{\rm{id}}(B^{\prime})=\int\delta[B^{\prime}-B({\bf r})]d{\bf r}.\] (1)

By assuming the internal field distribution P_{\rm{id}}(B) given by Eq. (1) and accounting for the FLL disorder by multiplying P_{\rm{id}}(B) to a Gaussian function,[32] one obtains the theoretical polarization function P(t) given by

\[P(t) = A\,\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\sigma_{g}^{2}+\sigma_{N}^{2} \big{)}t^{2}\right]\!\int P_{\rm{id}}(B)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}\,Bt+\phi)d\,B\] (2) \[\mbox+A_{\rm{bg}}\exp\bigg{(}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\rm{bg}}^{2}t ^{2}\bigg{)}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}\,B_{\rm{bg}}t+\phi),\]

which was used to fit the \muSR time spectra. Here, \gamma_{\mu}=2\pi\,\times\,135.53 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, A is the asymmetry of the sample signal, \phi is the phase of the muon-spin ensemble, \sigma_{g} is a parameter related to FLL disorder,[33] and \sigma_{N} is the additional muon depolarization due to the nuclear magnetism of various ions in the samples. The parameters A_{\rm{bg}}, \sigma_{\rm{bg}}, and B_{\rm{bg}} correspond to asymmetry, relaxation, and field of the background signal, respectively. The asymmetries A and A_{\rm{bg}} are found to be temperature independent and A+A_{\rm{bg}}=0.20 (for the GPS and LTF spectrometers) and A+A_{\rm{bg}}=0.27 (for the GPD spectrometer). The background asymmetry A_{\rm{bg}}\simeq 0.004 is negligibly small for the measurements in the temperature range above 1.7 K (on the GPS spectrometer), while it is substantial in the measurements in the low-temperature range (A_{\rm{bg}}\approx 0.07 on the LTF spectrometer and A_{\rm{bg}}\approx 0.20 on the GPD spectrometer). The magnitude of \sigma_{N}\simeq 0.05(1)\,\mus^{-1} in BaPt_{1-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} was determined from data above T_{c}. Zero-field \muSR measurements in BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ref. [19]) show that the ZF relaxation rate is small and temperature independent, confirming the absence of magnetism. Thus, \sigma_{N} is negligibly small in comparison to the muon depolarization caused by the nanoscale field inhomogeneities of the FLL. The background relaxation is also small (\sigma_{\rm{bg}}\simeq 0.30 or 0.007\,\mus^{-1}), since it corresponds to the signals originating from the copper or silver sample holder and from the walls of the cryostat.

The whole temperature dependence was fitted globally with Eq. (2) with the common parameters A, A_{\rm{bg}}, B_{\rm{bg}}, \sigma_{\rm{bg}}, and \sigma_{N}. In addition, the GL parameter \kappa=\lambda/\xi was taken as temperature independent [i.e., the temperature-dependent parameters \xi=\lambda/\kappa and B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi^{2} are related to \lambda(T)]. The only temperature-dependent parameters are \lambda and \langle B\rangle. The parameter \sigma_{g} can be left free; however, relating \sigma_{g}=a/\lambda^{2} with the single global parameter a reduces the total number of parameters, thus reducing the error bars for \lambda. Such a relation corresponds to a rigid FLL.[33] For a more detailed description of the fitting procedure we refer to Ref. [34].

The mean value of the superfluid density is related to the magnetic penetration depth as follows (see Appendix A): \rho_{s}\propto(1-b)/\lambda^{2}=1/\tilde{\lambda}^{2}.[18, 31] Here, b=\langle B\rangle/B_{c2}(0) is the reduced field and \tilde{\lambda} is the effective magnetic penetration depth.[32] The temperature dependencies of 1/\tilde{\lambda}^{2} for the BaPt_{1-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} samples are shown in Fig. 3(a). The superfluid density saturates exponentially below \approx T_{c}/3. This documents the absence of quasiparticle excitations in the low-temperature limit, which in turn suggests a superconducting gap without nodes in these compounds. In Fig. 3(b) we show fitting results for \langle B\rangle. The magnitude of field inhomogeneity due to demagnetization effects is only a small fraction of \langle B\rangle-B_{\rm{app}} since the shape of each sample is close to an ellipsoid (where internal field is homogeneous).

The low-temperature limits of the magnetic penetration depth and the upper critical field obtained for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} are \lambda=204(4) nm and B_{c2}=0.46(3) T (at T=1.7 K), respectively. These values substantially differ from those reported in Ref. [14], \lambda=320 nm and B_{c2}=1.8 T, obtained by magnetization and specific-heat measurements, respectively. This discrepancy is explained by substantial scattering of Cooper pairs on nonmagnetic impurities with the mean free

All compounds exhibit exponential saturation of \rho_{s} in the low-temperature limit, documenting a fully developed gap on the Fermi surface. Solid symbols correspond to measurements above 1.6 K (on the GPS spectrometer), while the empty symbols correspond to those measured in the low-temperature limit (on the GPD at x=0.5, 0.75, and 1 and on the LTF at x=0 spectrometers). The solid lines are fits to Eq. (5). (b) Temperature dependence of \langle B\rangle for the samples measured on the GPS spectrometer.

  path l comparable to the clean-limit coherence length \xi_{\rm cl}. Indeed, the coherence length and the magnetic penetration depth are related to those of the clean limit (l\rightarrow\infty) as follows [35]:

\[\xi=\frac{\xi_{\rm cl}l}{\xi_{\rm cl}+l},\] (3)

\[\lambda=\lambda_{\rm cl}\sqrt{1+\frac{\xi_{\rm cl}}{l}}.\] (4)

Fitting this equation to the values of \xi_{1} and \xi_{2} reported in Ref. [14] and obtained here, respectively, with the additional condition l_{1}/l_{2}=\rho_{2}^{0}/\rho_{1}^{0}=3.75 (here \rho_{i}^{0} are corresponding residual resistivities) we obtain for l_{1}=23 nm, l_{2}=86 nm, and \xi_{\rm cl}=35 nm (see Fig. 4). Note, here we used the GL relation B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi^{2} to obtain \xi_{i} (i=1, 2). These values of mean free paths (l_{1} and l_{2}) explain well also different reports for magnetic penetration depths \lambda_{1}=320 nm and \lambda_{2}=204 nm (see Fig. 4). Consequently, the compound BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is in between the clean and dirty-limit superconductors. The residual resistivities of the compounds with x=0.5,0.75, and 1 are larger than for x=0. Therefore, they are also dirtier than the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound without Au substitution.

For the analysis of the superfluid density we adopt the BCS s-wave model with arbitrary impurity scattering rate 1/\tau[36]:

\[\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}=\frac{1}{\lambda_{0}^{2}}\pi\,k_{B}\,T\sum_{n=-\infty}^{ \infty}\frac{1}{Z_{n}}\frac{\Delta^{2}(T)}{\left[\varepsilon_{n}^{2}+\Delta^{2 }(T)\right]^{3/2}},\] (5)

with

\[Z_{n}=1+\frac{\hbar}{\tau}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_{n}^{2}+\Delta^{2}(T)}}.\] (6)

Here, the classical BCS temperature dependence of the gap was used, \Delta(t)=\Delta_{0}\delta(t) with \delta(t)=\tanh\{1.82[1.018(t-1)^{0.51}]\} (with t=T/T_{c}) [35].k_{B} and \hbar are Boltzmann and reduced Planck constants, respectively, \epsilon_{n}=\pi\,T(2n+1) are Matsubara frequencies, while Z_{n} are renormalization factors for \epsilon_{n} and the superconducting gap \Delta. In the extreme cases of the clean (\tau\rightarrow\infty) and dirty (\tau\to 0) limits this equation converges to the classical clean and dirty superconductor curves (see Appendix B) [35]. For the Fermi velocity [14]v_{F}=52\,000 m s^{-1} and mean free path l=86 nm of BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, we obtain the scattering time \tau=1.6\times 10^{-12} s.

The fits of Eq. (5) to 1/\hat{\lambda}^{2} are shown in Fig. 3(a) by solid lines. The fit results for \Delta_{0}, T_{c}, and the low-temperature limits of 1/\hat{\lambda}(0)^{2} are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen in Appendix B, there is a correlation between the parameters \tau and \Delta_{0} in Eq. (5). Therefore, for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (x=0) we used \tau=1.6\times 10^{-12} s as an estimate. For the compounds with x=0.5, 0.75, and 1 we used the upper limit of \tau_{\rm max}=1.6\times 10^{-12} s, since they are dirtier than the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound. The fit of the data was performed for \tau=\tau_{\rm max} and \tau\to 0 (dirty limit, when \tau\ll\xi_{\rm cl}/v_{F}). Thus, we obtain the upper and lower limits of \Delta_{0}^{\rm max} and \Delta_{0}^{\rm min}, respectively. The values of the gap reported in Table 1 are \Delta_{0}=0.5(\Delta_{0}^{\rm max}+\Delta_{0}^{\rm min}) with errors including the uncertainty in \tau and the (much smaller) statistical error.

With increasing Au substitution the T_{c} increases; however, the gap-to-T_{c} ratio \Delta_{0}/k_{B}\,T_{c} increases more suddenly and remains essentially unchanged for the Au substitutions x=0.5,0.75, and 1. The T_{c} of phonon-mediated superconductivity may be described within the McMillan formula [35]. The Debye temperature is practically the same for our four compounds [28]. Thus, the only factor determining the increase of T_{c} is the electronic DOS at the Fermi level, which significantly increases with Au substitution beyond x=0.4 (cf. Fig. 1 in Ref. [28]).

Another interesting feature is the dependence of the superfluid density upon Au substitution. With increasing x, \rho_{s}(0) first decreases, goes through a minimum, and then increases with further increasing x. Such a behavior is rather unusual and contrasts with previous observations of a power-law-like relation between T_{c} and the superfluid density in cuprate high-T_{c} superconductors [37], NbB_{2}[38], MgB_{2}[39], or predicted theoretically [40, 41]. However, in the present case such a behavior can be understood. The superfluid density and the magnetic penetration depth \lambda are dependent on the scattering rate of the Cooper pairs \tau (or the mean free path l) [see Eq. (4)]. Therefore, the minimum in \rho_{s}(0) is probably due to the dependence of \tau on the Au content x.

Further information about the order parameter can be obtained from the field dependence of the superfluid density.

  As it is known for superconductors with nodes in the gap, a significant field dependence of \lambda is observed,[42] while for the large number of classical BCS superconductors \lambda is field independent.[43] A fit of the \muSR-time spectra at different fields and for T = 1.7 K using Eq. (2) results in field-independent values of \lambda.[44] For the fit the field-independent value of \xi obtained from the GL relation B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2} was used. Therefore, we next fitted the whole field dependence of the spectra globally with common parameters \lambda and \xi. Note that the values of the GL parameter \kappa=\lambda/\xi used in the fit of the temperature dependence were obtained from the fit of the corresponding field scan. In Fig. 2 we show the FT \muSR spectra for the BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12} compound at T = 1.7 K for the broad range of reduced fields b=B/B_{c2} = 0.06, 0.12, 0.24, 0.36, 0.54, and 0.76. The fit results in field-independent values of the magnetic penetration depth [\lambda = 239(4) nm] and of the coherence length [\xi = 18.8(5) nm]. This value of \xi is in good agreement with that obtained by the GL relation from the corresponding B_{c2} (B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}). The fit results for \lambda, \xi, and \kappa in BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 are summarized in Table 2. The upper critical field for x = 1 is in fair agreement with the value given in our previous work,[28] but for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} the B_{c2}(0) is much lower than previously reported.[14; 28] This drastic discrepancy is investigated and discussed in the following section.

### Macroscopic measurement data

Previously, for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} an upper critical field B_{c2}(0) of about 2.0 T was reported by our group, mainly based on T_{c}(B_{\rm app}) data from resistivity measurements in fixed applied fields B_{\rm app}.[28] This value was confirmed by similar data of Bauer _et al.[14]_ [B_{c2}(0) = 1.8 T] from both resistivity and specific-heat data in field.[14] However, the T_{c} reported for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} in Ref. [14] is 5.35 K (from both resistivity and specific heat), which is inconsistent with the magnetic onset T_{c}\approx 4.9 K of our present and T_{c}\approx 5.0 K of our previous x=0 samples. The origin of the drastically different upper critical field values as well as of the unusually large variation of T_{c} for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} samples remained unclear. For this reason we (re-)investigated the present BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (x=0) sample as well as the x=0 and x=1 samples from our previous study[28] by macroscopic probes (magnetization, specific heat, electrical resistivity).

An isothermal magnetization loop at T = 1.85 K for the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample used for the \muSR measurements is given in Fig. 5. It shows the typical picture of a type II superconductor with medium large GL parameter \kappa. A weak second peak effect in M(B_{\rm app}) is observed around 0.35 T, indicating relatively weak flux-line pinning in a pure sample.[45] Above this field the hysteresis drastically diminishes (this field is often taken as upper critical field B_{c2})[45] and becomes reversible above B_{\rm app} = 500(30) mT. The reversible SC magnetization decreases to a value of less than 1/1000 of the maximum magnetization signal (the noise level of the measurement) at B_{\rm app} = 540(50) mT, which we adopt as the upper critical field B_{c2}(1.85 K). Considering the only slightly different temperatures, this value is compatible with B_{c2}(0) from our \muSR investigation (see Table 2). The lower critical field can be estimated from the first deviation of M(B_{\rm app}) from linearity [Fig. 5(b)]. Adopting a 0.5% criterion for a significant deviation, we find B_{c1} = 6.0(1.0) mT, again for T = 1.85 K. This experimental value for B_{c1} is, however, only a lower limit due to the strong influence of the demagnetization effect for a nearly perfect diamagnet. From the B_{c2} value determined from magnetization and \kappa = 8.0 from Table 2, we obtain with the relation B_{c2} = \sqrt{2}\kappa\,B_{c,\rm th} a thermodynamic critical field B_{c,\rm th}\approx 48 mT, which is clearly larger than the value calculated from the free enthalpy difference from specific heat (\approx 40 mT for T = 1.85 K). Using B_{c1}\approx (ln \kappa + 0.5)B_{c,\rm th}/2\kappa (valid for small \kappa),[30] we find B_{c1} = 7.7 mT, in fair agreement with the estimate from the magnetization curve. Only slightly different values for the critical fields were obtained from similar magnetization data (not shown) taken on the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample used in Ref. [28] [B_{c1} = 4.2(1.0) mT and B_{c2} = 590(50) mT, both at T = 1.85 K].

The magnetization curve for the BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12} sample (x = 1) of the present study is given in Fig. 6. There is no visible second peak effect and, thus, the upper critical field can be determined accurately from the sharp kinks in M(B_{\rm app}) [B_{c2} = 1820(20) mT; see 100-fold magnification of the data in Fig. 6]. The estimated B_{c1} is 11.5(1.0) mT (T = 1.85 K; criterion

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c}  & \lambda & \xi & & B_{c2} (1.7 K) & \rho_{0} \\ x & (nm) & (nm) & \kappa & (T) & (\mu\Omega cm) \\

While the B_{c2} value is only slightly lower compared to the one in Table 2, the GL parameter \kappa\approx 13.1 is clearly lower than the value determined by \muSR spectroscopy. The B_{c,\text{th}} calculated using \kappa from Table 2 and B_{c2} from the magnetization curve is \approx 99 mT, which is again clearly larger than the value derived from the specific heat data (\approx 79 mT at 1.85 K).

In Fig. 7 the difference of the specific heat \Delta c_{p}(T)=c_{p}(B_{\text{app}})-c_{p}(B>B_{c2}) is plotted for the present BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample. For fields \geqslant 600 mT no SC signal is observed above our lowest temperature of 1.8 K. The midpoints of the second-order-type transitions T_{c}(B_{\text{app}}) were evaluated. The quadratic extrapolation of these data for B_{c2}(T) to zero temperature results in B_{c2}(0)=470(50) mT, in excellent agreement with the values from \muSR and magnetization. For the sample used in Ref. [28] we extrapolate B_{c2}(0)=540(50) mT. Specific-heat data in field for the other compositions are given in Ref. [28].

The electrical resistivity of the present x=0 sample at 300 K is \approx 90 \mu_m_ than with a residual resistance ratio 6.1 [Fig. 8(b)]. Such low residual resistivity ratio (RRR) values are not typical for polycrystalline samples of other MPt_{4}Ge_{12} compounds [cf. RRR = 33 or 42 (Ref. [15]], RRR \approx 100 (Ref. [16]), or RRR \geqslant 100 (Ref. [46]). Obviously, the crystalline quality of polycrystalline BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} samples is worse compared to that of other members of the family of filled Pt-Ge skutterudites. RRR \approx 6, however, indicates that a BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample with a clearly lower defect concentration than in Refs. [14] or [47] has been achieved. For the present sample the SC transition in \rho(T,B_{\text{app}}) decreases continuous with increasing field, except for very low fields [Fig. 8(a)]. The onset, mid, and zero-resistance temperatures are plotted against B_{\text{app}} in Fig. 8(c). Surprisingly, the transition in \rho(T) is still complete for a field of 1.0 T and the onset is even visible at 1.9 K in 1.8 T. Such high upper critical fields are in agreement with the conclusions in Ref. [14], but in strong contrast to the consistently much lower B_{c2} values obtained from the bulk probes \muSR, magnetization, and specific heat. A quadratic extrapolation of T_{\text{c,mid}} (range of fit 0.2-1.2 T) to zero temperature results in B_{c2}^{\text{res}}(0)=1460 mT [dashed line in Fig. 8(c)]. In addition, a clear anomaly is seen for the lowest fields, where the resistive T_{c} is almost 0.5 K higher than expected from the extrapolation curve. Actually, the extrapolated resistive T_{\text{c,mid}}(0)\approx 4.74 K agrees well with that from the bulk measurements. For the sample of BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12} no significant discrepancy between bulk and resistive value for B_{c2} is found (see Ref. [28]).

What is the origin of this discrepancy in the B_{c2} and T_{c}(0) values from bulk properties and resistivity in BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}? In the low-field susceptibility (B_{\text{app}}=2 mT, \muSR sample) a bulk T_{c} onset of 4.87 K is observed (determined by the tangent to the steepest slope of the field-cooling Meissner

  transition). However, above \approx5.0 K there is still a very weak diamagnetic signal, which vanishes exponentially with increasing temperature. The signal is only a little weaker in field cooling than measured after zero-field cooling (zfc), but the maximum of this zfc signal is about three orders of magnitude lower than the zfc signal at 4.0 K (or 1.5 orders of magnitude weaker than the bulk Meissner effect).

This weak diamagnetism, the concomitant zero electrical resistance, and the too large B_{c2} value from resistivity data may root in two phenomena: (i) the presence of a minor SC impurity phase which forms a percolating SC network with an \sim 0.5 K higher T_{c}(0) and much higher B_{c2} than the main phase, or (ii) strong classical surface superconductivity of the main phase with a critical field B_{c3}(0) \ggB_{c2}(0). The second possibility seems to be unlikely due to the fact that T_{\rm c,bulk}(0) \neqT_{\rm c,surface} and that the required surface critical field B_{c3} would well need to exceed the Saint-James-de Gennes limit of \approx1.7B_{c2}.[48]

For BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} no homogeneity range is observed since the lattice parameter of the filled-skutterudite phase in a sample with composition Ba_{0.9}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is 8.6837(3) A, which is practically the same as for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}.[26] Extended energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analyses on metallographic polished surfaces of the present BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample result in a composition Ba_{0.9(1)}Pt_{4.0(1)}Ge_{11.9(1)}, which agrees very well with the nominal one. Interestingly, there is a significant difference of the lattice parameter of all our BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} samples [present sample a = 8.6838(5) ] with that reported by Bauer _et al._[14] [a = 8.6928(3) A],[14] which we currently cannot explain.

The currently studied large BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample also contains, besides the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} main phase, some BaPtGe_{3} [no superconductivity observed above 1.8 K (Refs. [49] and [50])]. The content of this phase is estimated from Rietveld refinements to be \sim4%. Five weak lines in the x-ray diffraction pattern belong to PtGe_{2}. These lines are too weak to refine a phase content, therefore we estimate a PtGe_{2} phase fraction of below 2%. PtGe_{2} is reported to be a superconductor with T_{c} = 0.4 K.[51] The presence of these minority phases in the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample thus also cannot explain the observation of a higher upper critical field value in resistivity data.

The resistive percolation (a SC path) at a higher temperature than the bulk T_{c} hints at a modification of the surface layers of the grains of the majority skutterudite phase, probably due to crystallographic defects or strain. These effects will result in a larger scattering rate and a shorter mean free path of the charge carriers, thus making the superconductor dirtier, subsequently enlarging the effective penetration depth well above the bulk value.

Since the present samples are polycrystalline pieces, an estimate of the mean free path from the residual resistivity values by the standard formula[52] is problematic and gives at best a lower limit for I. Moreover, skutterudites are not simple metals which can be treated in a one-band model. Our estimate of the minimal mean free path in BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} using a free-electron model results in I_{\rm min}\approx 25, 14, 14, and 19 nm for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively.[53] In view of these values of I_{\rm min}, the superconductivity in the bulk of the crystallites is neither in the clean nor in the dirty limit. On the surface, however, the superconductivity seems to be in the dirty limit, leading to much shorter coherence lengths than in the bulk. Hence, crystalline defects or impurities on the grain surfaces probably lead to the higher upper critical field value in resistivity data. An open question is the clearly higher T_{c} of these grain surfaces. The T_{c} of a superconductor with defects is--in most cases--lower than the T_{c} of the pure material, however, it is also known that strain, especially on surfaces, can drastically enhance the T_{c}. While the growth of single crystals of sufficient size of BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} was not successful until now, investigations on such crystals would be highly desirable.

## IV Conclusion

We performed an investigation using transverse-field \muSR spectroscopy for a series of polycrystalline BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} superconductors with x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. Highly asymmetric \muSR time spectra were analyzed within the framework of the GL theory by precise minimization of the GL free energy.[31] Zero-temperature magnetic penetration depths [\lambda(0)] and GL parameters (\kappa = \lambda/\xi) were evaluated (see Table 2). The temperature dependence of the superfluid density \rho_{s} in all the compounds saturates exponentially in the low-temperature limit, which documents the absence of nodes in the superconducting gap function. This finding is in agreement with the results of a previous NMR study.[25] Our analysis shows that \rho_{s} is well described within the classical s-wave BCS model with gap-to-T_{c} ratios (\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}) of 1.70, 2.07, 2.15, and 2.02 for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively. These ratios are in fair agreement with the reduced specific-heat jump \delta c_{P}/\gamma_{N}T_{c} from our previous study.[28] The observation of field-independent \lambda values further supports the classical s-wave pairing scenario for these compounds. Thus, the present experimental results from bulk probes point to the classical s-wave phonon-mediated superconductivity for all compounds in the series BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} up to x = 1. The upper critical field data from the \muSR study are in good agreement with bulk-sensitive thermodynamic measurements of the upper critical fields of BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12}. The origin of much higher upper critical fields observed in electrical resistivity measurements for the present BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample (as in previous reports[14, 15, 28]) is due to a larger carrier scattering rate at the surface of the crystallites.

## Appendix A Details of calculations and GL definitions

Below we describe some details of our calculations and introduce the basic definitions of the GL theory used in this  analysis. As shown by Abrikosov, a type II superconductor forms a periodic vortex or FLL in a range of magnetic fields (B).[54] Here, B_{c1}<B<B_{c2}, where B_{c1} and B_{c2} are the lower and upper critical fields, respectively. The GL theory used by Abrikosov proved to be one of the most useful approaches for the evaluation of the field distribution in a type II superconductor (although it is strictly valid only close to T_{c}) and forms the basis for the analysis of TF \muSR data.

For the limiting cases of \kappa\rightarrow\infty (\kappa=\lambda/\xi is the GL parameter) and B_{c1}<B\ll B_{c2} simplified, second moment analysis methods were developed.[30, 55] In the general case of arbitrary \kappa and B, the solution is more complicated and various approximations have been suggested.[32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] A feasible and precise minimization algorithm of the "classical" GL free energy has been suggested by Brandt.[31] The method was first used in the experimental work in Ref. [61]. The difference between the SC and the normal-state free energies \Delta F=F_{s}-F_{u} is expressed (in SI units) as[35, 62, 31]

\[\Delta F=\alpha|\psi|^{2}+\frac{\beta}{2}|\psi|^{4}+\frac{1}{2m^{*}}\left| \left(\frac{\hbar}{i}\nabla-2e\mathbf{A}\right)\psi\right|^{2}+\frac{\mathbf{ B}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}.\] (1)

Here, \mathbf{B=}\operatorname{rot}\mathbf{A}, the parameter \beta=(\kappa e\hbar/m)^{2}\mu_{0}/2 is determined by the GL parameter \kappa, and \psi_{0}^{2}=-\alpha/\beta>0. The parameter \psi_{0}^{2} is the superfluid density deep in the bulk of the superconductor in the limit of low fields (i.e., in the Meissner state), which is related to the magnetic penetration depth \lambda. The relation between \lambda^{-2} and \psi_{0}^{2} is (in SI units)[62]

\[\lambda^{-2}=\frac{4\mu_{0}e^{2}}{m^{*}}\psi_{0}^{2}.\] (2)

In an applied field, however, the superfluid density |\psi|^{2} is spatially inhomogeneous with minima at the vortex cores due to the formation of a FLL.[54] Figure 9 shows the spatial variation of |\psi(\mathbf{r})|^{2}/\psi_{0}^{2} at different reduced fields b=\langle B\rangle/B_{c2} in the limit of \kappa\rightarrow\infty corresponding to the minimum of Eq. (1) (\langle B\rangle is the mean field in the sample). Although \lambda is field independent (as well as \alpha and \beta) and finite at T=T_{c}^{B_{c2}}\equiv T_{c}(B\neq 0), the superfluid density reduces with increasing field and vanishes at T=T_{c}^{B_{c2}}. Therefore, with increasing field for b\gtrsim 0.05 (e.g., for a non-high-T_{c} superconductor; see Fig. 9) the correction factor (1-b) to the superfluid density becomes significant. The mean value of the superfluid density reduces with increasing field as follows:[30, 51]

\[\rho_{s}=\langle|\psi|^{2}\rangle\simeq(1-b)\psi_{0}^{2}.\] (3)

For small values of b\to 0 and high \kappa, as in most of the high-T_{c} superconductors, we have \rho_{s}\propto\lambda^{-2}. In the present analysis the free energy [Eq. (1)] for the given \lambda, \xi, and \langle B\rangle was minimized using the method suggested by Brandt.[31] This results in a solution for spatial variation of the field \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) and the order parameter \psi(\mathbf{r}).

## Appendix B Some details on Eq. (5)

We use Eq. (5) suggested in Ref. [36] for the case of arbitrary scattering rate 1/\tau (mean free path l=v_{F}\tau). For the classical BCS gap-to-T_{c} ratio \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.76 the temperature dependence of the normalized superfluid density \lambda_{0}^{2}/\lambda^{2}(t) obtained with Eq. (5) in clean (\tau\gg\xi_{\rm cl}/v_{F}) and dirty (\tau\ll\xi_{\rm cl}/v_{F}) limits is given in Fig. 10 (t=T/T_{c}). The results are in good agreement with curves given in Ref. [35]. Note, the shape of \lambda_{0}^{2}/\lambda^{2}(t) depends on the scattering rate only for \tau\sim\xi_{\rm cl}/v_{F}. For the current precision of measurement the parameters \Delta_{0} and \tau are correlated. The dirty-limit curve with \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.76 can be well fitted with the clean-limit model with \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.0 (see Fig. 10).

Figure 10: (Color online) Temperature dependence of normalized superfluid density \lambda_{0}^{2}/\lambda^{2}(t) in clean and dirty limits (t=T/T_{c}). In open circles \lambda_{0}^{2}/\lambda^{2}(t) in the clean limit but larger gap-to-T_{c} ratio is shown.

###### Abstract

We report on a study of the superconducting properties for a series of polycrystalline BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} filled skutterudite compounds for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. Muon spin rotation (_u_SR) spectroscopy as well as magnetization, specific-heat, and electrical resistivity measurements were performed. The magnetic penetration depth \lambda, the coherence length \xi, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa are evaluated. The temperature dependence of the superfluid density is well described by an _s_-wave superconducting gap and this classical scenario is supported by the field-independent \lambda. The gap-to-_T_{c}_ ratio \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}_ increases with the Au content from 1.70 for x = 0 to 2.1(1) for x = 1. By combining _u_SR, magnetization, and specific-heat data, we find that BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} compounds are in between the dirty and clean limits with mean free paths of the carriers l ~ \sim \xi. Interestingly, resistivity data for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} indicate a much higher upper critical field, which is probably due to defects or impurities close to the surface of the crystallites.

## 1 Introduction

Filled skutterudite compounds _MT_{4}X_{12}_ with a framework formed from T (Fe, Ru, Os) and X (P, As, Sb) atoms and "filled" with M atoms (rare-earth, alkaline-earth, or alkali metals) came in focus of recent research activities due to a number of unconventional phenomena.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] In their cubic crystal structure, the filler cations M reside in icosahedral cages formed by tilted _TX_{6}_ octahedra. The pronounced vibrational amplitudes of the M atoms have been linked to dynamic scattering mechanisms for heat-carrying acoustic phonons resulting in a reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a prerequisite for thermoelectric applications.[8] Several filled skutterudites display superconductivity and as well show a broad variety of other interesting phenomena.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

Recently, a new family of filled skutterudites based on a different framework of platinum and germanium with the chemical formula _M_Pt_{4}Ge_{12} has been discovered.[14, 15] Several of these compounds are superconducting (SC). The compositions with M = Sr and Ba (Refs. [14, 15] and [15]) have SC transition temperatures _T_c around 5 K and the later reported ThPt_{4}Ge_{12} is SC below 4.62 K.[16, 17] Due to a peak in the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy (_E_{F}_), LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} has a significantly higher _T_c of 8.3 K.[15] Interestingly, PrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, with trivalent Pr in a nonmagnetic crystal field ground state, is also SC with an only slightly lower _T_c of 7.9 K. Its SC properties[18, 19] show some similarities with the heavy-fermion superconductivity of PrOs_{4}Sb_{12}.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] Most remarkably, an unconventional SC order parameter with point nodes and a rather similar gap-to-_T_{c}_ ratio has been observed. Moreover, signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking were found in PrPt_{4}Ge_{12} by zero-field _u_SR.[19]

For LaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, SrPt_{4}Ge_{12}, and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, NMR and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) studies suggested an _s_-wave BCS SC state with \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}\approx 1.60.[23, 24, 25] Theoretical and experimental studies of the electronic structure of this class of skutterudites consistently show rather deep-lying Pt _5d_ states which only partially form covalent bands with Ge 4p electrons.[26] In turn, the electronic states at _E_{F}_ that are relevant for the SC behavior, can be firmly assigned to originate predominantly from Ge 4p electrons.[27] Different from _M_Pt_{4}Ge_{12} (_M_ = La, Pr) a pronounced peak in the DOS is located little above _E_{F}_ for SrPt_{4}Ge_{12} and BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}.[28] Here, the low-lying Pt states open up the chance to influence the Fermi level in a rigid-band-like manner by a suitable substitution of Pt. By electron doping, the DOS and thus the SC _T_{c}_ of BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} could be systematically influenced through substitution of Pt by Au. The _T_{c}_ in the series BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} could be optimized to 7.0 K for x = 1.[28] For a doping with more than 1.0 extra electrons per formula unit a decrease of _T_{c}_ is expected.[28] Actually, the partial substitution of Au for Pt in LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} leads to a continuous decrease of _T_{c}.[29]

Here, we report on a study of BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} compounds (_x_ = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) by means of transverse field (TF) muon-spin rotation (_u_SR) spectroscopy and macroscopic magnetization, specific-heat, and electrical resistivity measurements. High-quality _u_SR spectra of well-ordered SC flux-line lattices allowed us to use the exact solution of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for the analysis. The superfluid density (\rho_{s}) was found to saturate exponentially in the low-temperature limit, suggesting a SC gap without nodes, in agreement with a NMR study.[25] The temperature dependence of \rho_{s} is well described by the _s_-wave BCS function with the gap-to-_T_{c}_ ratios (\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}) of 1.70, 2.07, 2.15, and 2.02 for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively. This clear increase of \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c} (viz., electron-phonon coupling) with x is in agreement with the results of our previous study.[28] The BCS character of the superconductivity is further supported by the field-independent magnetic penetration depth (\lambda). By combining _u_SR, magnetization, and specific-heat data we find that BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} compounds are in between the dirty and clean limits with mean free path of the carriers l ~ \sim \xi. In electrical resistivity measurements on BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} we observe superconductivity for fields much higher than the (bulk) upper critical field. This discrepancy appears especially for x = 0 samples and its origin is discussed in terms of the presence of chemical or crystallographic defects close to or on the surface of the crystallites.

 The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we give some experimental details, Sec. III describes the method of analysis of our \muSR data, and then we present and discuss the results from the \muSR as well as from the macroscopic methods. Our conclusions are given in Sec. IV. In Appendixes A and B we describe the details of our calculations and give the relevant GL definitions.

## II Experimental details

Polycrystalline samples of BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} with bulk T_{c} values of 4.9(1), 5.3(1), 6.25(5), and 6.95(5) K for x=0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively, were prepared as described in Refs. [15] and [28]. The SC transition temperatures T_{c} were determined from the onset of the Meissner flux expulsion (field cooling; tangent to the steepest slope and extrapolation to \chi=0) in magnetic susceptibility data measured in a nominal field of 2 mT (MPMS-XL7, Quantum Design).

The TF \muSR experiments were performed at the \piM3 and \muE1 beamlines at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen Switzerland) at the GPS, the LTF, and the GPD spectrometers. Each sample used for the \muSR study has an ellipsoidlike shape of a droplet with dimensions \simeq 7 \times 7 \times 4 mm^{3}, and therefore, field inhomogeneities due to demagnetization are negligible. The samples were field cooled from above T_{c} down to 1.6 K in a field of 50 mT and measured as a function of temperature (on the GPS spectrometer). Additional measurements were performed down to T\simeq 0.29 K (GPD spectrometer; ^{3}He cryostat) and T\simeq 0.03 K (LTF spectrometer; ^{3}He/^{4}He dilution cryostat) in an applied field of 50 mT. Measurements in a series of fields ranging from 10 to 640 mT at 1.7 K were also performed. Typical counting statistics were \approx 6 \times 10^{6} positron events per each data point.

Isothermal magnetization loops at 1.85 K were also recorded on the above mentioned magnetometer. In order to reduce demagnetization effects for these measurements, splinters of the samples were glued to a quartz capillary with their longest dimensions parallel to the field direction. Specific-heat capacity as well as electrical resistance measurements (ac, 93 Hz, current density j = 0.0072 A mm^{-2}) at T_{c} and up to 320 K were performed in magnetic fields up to 2.0 T in a measurement system (PPMS 9, Quantum Design).

## III Analysis, results, and discussion

### Muon spin rotation data

Figure 1 exhibits typical \muSR time spectra measured above and below T_{c} = 6.95 K in BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12}. The spectra of the other samples are similar. Negligibly small muon relaxations above the respective T_{c} are observed in all samples for the whole field range. A fit with the function A\cos(\gamma_{\mu}Bt+\phi)\exp(-1/2\sigma_{N}^{2}t^{2}) results in \sigma_{N}\leqslant 0.06\mus^{-1} (here, A, B, \phi, and \sigma_{N} are asymmetry, internal field, muon-spin phase, and relaxation rate, respectively). The relaxation rate \sigma_{N}< 0.06\mus^{-1} is mostly due to the nuclear magnetism of Ba, Pt, Au, and Ge isotopes, which causes a weak depolarization of the muon-spin ensemble. Below T_{c}, all samples exhibit relaxing \muSR asymmetry spectra due to the spatial variation of the internal field in the vortex-lattice state induced by the SC condensate. The FT of this signal directly shows the field distribution probed by the muon spins.

Figure 2 exhibits the FT spectra in BaPt_{3.5}Au_{0.5}Ge_{12} in a broad range of fields. The asymmetric character of the

Figure 2: (Color online) (a)-(f) Fourier transforms (FT) of the \muSR time spectra at 1.7 K in different applied magnetic fields \langle B\rangle= 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.45, and 0.64 T for BaPt_{3.5}Au_{0.5}Ge_{12} (corresponding reduced fields are b=\langle B\rangle/B_{c2} = 0.06, 0.12, 0.24, 0.36, 0.54, and 0.76). In this compound, fields close to B_{c2}(1.7 K) = 0.84(4) T are reachable. The solid lines are the FT of the fit curves with Eq. (2). The field-dependent spectra are well described by the field-independent parameters \lambda = 239(4) nm and \xi = 18.8(5) nm.

  vortex-lattice field distributions--reflecting the signatures of singularities at the minimum, saddle, and core fields--is clearly visible. Consequently, we analyzed the \muSR spectra for all BaPt_{1-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} samples using the exact solution of the GL equations with the method suggested by Brandt (see Appendix A).[30, 31] The spatial magnetic field distribution B({\bf r})=B({\bf r},\lambda,\xi,(B)) within the unit cell of the flux-line lattice (FLL) was obtained by minimization of Eq. (A1). From the obtained B({\bf r}) the probability field distribution for the ideal (defect-free) FLL P_{\rm{id}}(B) is calculated as follows:

\[P_{\rm{id}}(B^{\prime})=\int\delta[B^{\prime}-B({\bf r})]d{\bf r}.\] (1)

By assuming the internal field distribution P_{\rm{id}}(B) given by Eq. (1) and accounting for the FLL disorder by multiplying P_{\rm{id}}(B) to a Gaussian function,[32] one obtains the theoretical polarization function P(t) given by

\[P(t) = A\,\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\sigma_{g}^{2}+\sigma_{N}^{2} \big{)}t^{2}\right]\!\int P_{\rm{id}}(B)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}\,Bt+\phi)d\,B\] (2) \[\mbox+A_{\rm{bg}}\exp\bigg{(}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\rm{bg}}^{2}t ^{2}\bigg{)}\cos(\gamma_{\mu}\,B_{\rm{bg}}t+\phi),\]

which was used to fit the \muSR time spectra. Here, \gamma_{\mu}=2\pi\,\times\,135.53 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, A is the asymmetry of the sample signal, \phi is the phase of the muon-spin ensemble, \sigma_{g} is a parameter related to FLL disorder,[33] and \sigma_{N} is the additional muon depolarization due to the nuclear magnetism of various ions in the samples. The parameters A_{\rm{bg}}, \sigma_{\rm{bg}}, and B_{\rm{bg}} correspond to asymmetry, relaxation, and field of the background signal, respectively. The asymmetries A and A_{\rm{bg}} are found to be temperature independent and A+A_{\rm{bg}}=0.20 (for the GPS and LTF spectrometers) and A+A_{\rm{bg}}=0.27 (for the GPD spectrometer). The background asymmetry A_{\rm{bg}}\simeq 0.004 is negligibly small for the measurements in the temperature range above 1.7 K (on the GPS spectrometer), while it is substantial in the measurements in the low-temperature range (A_{\rm{bg}}\approx 0.07 on the LTF spectrometer and A_{\rm{bg}}\approx 0.20 on the GPD spectrometer). The magnitude of \sigma_{N}\simeq 0.05(1)\,\mus^{-1} in BaPt_{1-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} was determined from data above T_{c}. Zero-field \muSR measurements in BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and LaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (Ref. [19]) show that the ZF relaxation rate is small and temperature independent, confirming the absence of magnetism. Thus, \sigma_{N} is negligibly small in comparison to the muon depolarization caused by the nanoscale field inhomogeneities of the FLL. The background relaxation is also small (\sigma_{\rm{bg}}\simeq 0.30 or 0.007\,\mus^{-1}), since it corresponds to the signals originating from the copper or silver sample holder and from the walls of the cryostat.

The whole temperature dependence was fitted globally with Eq. (2) with the common parameters A, A_{\rm{bg}}, B_{\rm{bg}}, \sigma_{\rm{bg}}, and \sigma_{N}. In addition, the GL parameter \kappa=\lambda/\xi was taken as temperature independent [i.e., the temperature-dependent parameters \xi=\lambda/\kappa and B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi^{2} are related to \lambda(T)]. The only temperature-dependent parameters are \lambda and \langle B\rangle. The parameter \sigma_{g} can be left free; however, relating \sigma_{g}=a/\lambda^{2} with the single global parameter a reduces the total number of parameters, thus reducing the error bars for \lambda. Such a relation corresponds to a rigid FLL.[33] For a more detailed description of the fitting procedure we refer to Ref. [34].

The mean value of the superfluid density is related to the magnetic penetration depth as follows (see Appendix A): \rho_{s}\propto(1-b)/\lambda^{2}=1/\tilde{\lambda}^{2}.[18, 31] Here, b=\langle B\rangle/B_{c2}(0) is the reduced field and \tilde{\lambda} is the effective magnetic penetration depth.[32] The temperature dependencies of 1/\tilde{\lambda}^{2} for the BaPt_{1-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} samples are shown in Fig. 3(a). The superfluid density saturates exponentially below \approx T_{c}/3. This documents the absence of quasiparticle excitations in the low-temperature limit, which in turn suggests a superconducting gap without nodes in these compounds. In Fig. 3(b) we show fitting results for \langle B\rangle. The magnitude of field inhomogeneity due to demagnetization effects is only a small fraction of \langle B\rangle-B_{\rm{app}} since the shape of each sample is close to an ellipsoid (where internal field is homogeneous).

The low-temperature limits of the magnetic penetration depth and the upper critical field obtained for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} are \lambda=204(4) nm and B_{c2}=0.46(3) T (at T=1.7 K), respectively. These values substantially differ from those reported in Ref. [14], \lambda=320 nm and B_{c2}=1.8 T, obtained by magnetization and specific-heat measurements, respectively. This discrepancy is explained by substantial scattering of Cooper pairs on nonmagnetic impurities with the mean free

All compounds exhibit exponential saturation of \rho_{s} in the low-temperature limit, documenting a fully developed gap on the Fermi surface. Solid symbols correspond to measurements above 1.6 K (on the GPS spectrometer), while the empty symbols correspond to those measured in the low-temperature limit (on the GPD at x=0.5, 0.75, and 1 and on the LTF at x=0 spectrometers). The solid lines are fits to Eq. (5). (b) Temperature dependence of \langle B\rangle for the samples measured on the GPS spectrometer.

  path l comparable to the clean-limit coherence length \xi_{\rm cl}. Indeed, the coherence length and the magnetic penetration depth are related to those of the clean limit (l\rightarrow\infty) as follows [35]:

\[\xi=\frac{\xi_{\rm cl}l}{\xi_{\rm cl}+l},\] (3)

\[\lambda=\lambda_{\rm cl}\sqrt{1+\frac{\xi_{\rm cl}}{l}}.\] (4)

Fitting this equation to the values of \xi_{1} and \xi_{2} reported in Ref. [14] and obtained here, respectively, with the additional condition l_{1}/l_{2}=\rho_{2}^{0}/\rho_{1}^{0}=3.75 (here \rho_{i}^{0} are corresponding residual resistivities) we obtain for l_{1}=23 nm, l_{2}=86 nm, and \xi_{\rm cl}=35 nm (see Fig. 4). Note, here we used the GL relation B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\,\xi^{2} to obtain \xi_{i} (i=1, 2). These values of mean free paths (l_{1} and l_{2}) explain well also different reports for magnetic penetration depths \lambda_{1}=320 nm and \lambda_{2}=204 nm (see Fig. 4). Consequently, the compound BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} is in between the clean and dirty-limit superconductors. The residual resistivities of the compounds with x=0.5,0.75, and 1 are larger than for x=0. Therefore, they are also dirtier than the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound without Au substitution.

For the analysis of the superfluid density we adopt the BCS s-wave model with arbitrary impurity scattering rate 1/\tau[36]:

\[\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}=\frac{1}{\lambda_{0}^{2}}\pi\,k_{B}\,T\sum_{n=-\infty}^{ \infty}\frac{1}{Z_{n}}\frac{\Delta^{2}(T)}{\left[\varepsilon_{n}^{2}+\Delta^{2 }(T)\right]^{3/2}},\] (5)

with

\[Z_{n}=1+\frac{\hbar}{\tau}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_{n}^{2}+\Delta^{2}(T)}}.\] (6)

Here, the classical BCS temperature dependence of the gap was used, \Delta(t)=\Delta_{0}\delta(t) with \delta(t)=\tanh\{1.82[1.018(t-1)^{0.51}]\} (with t=T/T_{c}) [35].k_{B} and \hbar are Boltzmann and reduced Planck constants, respectively, \epsilon_{n}=\pi\,T(2n+1) are Matsubara frequencies, while Z_{n} are renormalization factors for \epsilon_{n} and the superconducting gap \Delta. In the extreme cases of the clean (\tau\rightarrow\infty) and dirty (\tau\to 0) limits this equation converges to the classical clean and dirty superconductor curves (see Appendix B) [35]. For the Fermi velocity [14]v_{F}=52\,000 m s^{-1} and mean free path l=86 nm of BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}, we obtain the scattering time \tau=1.6\times 10^{-12} s.

The fits of Eq. (5) to 1/\hat{\lambda}^{2} are shown in Fig. 3(a) by solid lines. The fit results for \Delta_{0}, T_{c}, and the low-temperature limits of 1/\hat{\lambda}(0)^{2} are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen in Appendix B, there is a correlation between the parameters \tau and \Delta_{0} in Eq. (5). Therefore, for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (x=0) we used \tau=1.6\times 10^{-12} s as an estimate. For the compounds with x=0.5, 0.75, and 1 we used the upper limit of \tau_{\rm max}=1.6\times 10^{-12} s, since they are dirtier than the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} compound. The fit of the data was performed for \tau=\tau_{\rm max} and \tau\to 0 (dirty limit, when \tau\ll\xi_{\rm cl}/v_{F}). Thus, we obtain the upper and lower limits of \Delta_{0}^{\rm max} and \Delta_{0}^{\rm min}, respectively. The values of the gap reported in Table 1 are \Delta_{0}=0.5(\Delta_{0}^{\rm max}+\Delta_{0}^{\rm min}) with errors including the uncertainty in \tau and the (much smaller) statistical error.

With increasing Au substitution the T_{c} increases; however, the gap-to-T_{c} ratio \Delta_{0}/k_{B}\,T_{c} increases more suddenly and remains essentially unchanged for the Au substitutions x=0.5,0.75, and 1. The T_{c} of phonon-mediated superconductivity may be described within the McMillan formula [35]. The Debye temperature is practically the same for our four compounds [28]. Thus, the only factor determining the increase of T_{c} is the electronic DOS at the Fermi level, which significantly increases with Au substitution beyond x=0.4 (cf. Fig. 1 in Ref. [28]).

Another interesting feature is the dependence of the superfluid density upon Au substitution. With increasing x, \rho_{s}(0) first decreases, goes through a minimum, and then increases with further increasing x. Such a behavior is rather unusual and contrasts with previous observations of a power-law-like relation between T_{c} and the superfluid density in cuprate high-T_{c} superconductors [37], NbB_{2}[38], MgB_{2}[39], or predicted theoretically [40, 41]. However, in the present case such a behavior can be understood. The superfluid density and the magnetic penetration depth \lambda are dependent on the scattering rate of the Cooper pairs \tau (or the mean free path l) [see Eq. (4)]. Therefore, the minimum in \rho_{s}(0) is probably due to the dependence of \tau on the Au content x.

Further information about the order parameter can be obtained from the field dependence of the superfluid density.

  As it is known for superconductors with nodes in the gap, a significant field dependence of \lambda is observed,[42] while for the large number of classical BCS superconductors \lambda is field independent.[43] A fit of the \muSR-time spectra at different fields and for T = 1.7 K using Eq. (2) results in field-independent values of \lambda.[44] For the fit the field-independent value of \xi obtained from the GL relation B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2} was used. Therefore, we next fitted the whole field dependence of the spectra globally with common parameters \lambda and \xi. Note that the values of the GL parameter \kappa=\lambda/\xi used in the fit of the temperature dependence were obtained from the fit of the corresponding field scan. In Fig. 2 we show the FT \muSR spectra for the BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12} compound at T = 1.7 K for the broad range of reduced fields b=B/B_{c2} = 0.06, 0.12, 0.24, 0.36, 0.54, and 0.76. The fit results in field-independent values of the magnetic penetration depth [\lambda = 239(4) nm] and of the coherence length [\xi = 18.8(5) nm]. This value of \xi is in good agreement with that obtained by the GL relation from the corresponding B_{c2} (B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}). The fit results for \lambda, \xi, and \kappa in BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 are summarized in Table 2. The upper critical field for x = 1 is in fair agreement with the value given in our previous work,[28] but for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} the B_{c2}(0) is much lower than previously reported.[14; 28] This drastic discrepancy is investigated and discussed in the following section.

### Macroscopic measurement data

Previously, for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} an upper critical field B_{c2}(0) of about 2.0 T was reported by our group, mainly based on T_{c}(B_{\rm app}) data from resistivity measurements in fixed applied fields B_{\rm app}.[28] This value was confirmed by similar data of Bauer _et al.[14]_ [B_{c2}(0) = 1.8 T] from both resistivity and specific-heat data in field.[14] However, the T_{c} reported for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} in Ref. [14] is 5.35 K (from both resistivity and specific heat), which is inconsistent with the magnetic onset T_{c}\approx 4.9 K of our present and T_{c}\approx 5.0 K of our previous x=0 samples. The origin of the drastically different upper critical field values as well as of the unusually large variation of T_{c} for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} samples remained unclear. For this reason we (re-)investigated the present BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} (x=0) sample as well as the x=0 and x=1 samples from our previous study[28] by macroscopic probes (magnetization, specific heat, electrical resistivity).

An isothermal magnetization loop at T = 1.85 K for the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample used for the \muSR measurements is given in Fig. 5. It shows the typical picture of a type II superconductor with medium large GL parameter \kappa. A weak second peak effect in M(B_{\rm app}) is observed around 0.35 T, indicating relatively weak flux-line pinning in a pure sample.[45] Above this field the hysteresis drastically diminishes (this field is often taken as upper critical field B_{c2})[45] and becomes reversible above B_{\rm app} = 500(30) mT. The reversible SC magnetization decreases to a value of less than 1/1000 of the maximum magnetization signal (the noise level of the measurement) at B_{\rm app} = 540(50) mT, which we adopt as the upper critical field B_{c2}(1.85 K). Considering the only slightly different temperatures, this value is compatible with B_{c2}(0) from our \muSR investigation (see Table 2). The lower critical field can be estimated from the first deviation of M(B_{\rm app}) from linearity [Fig. 5(b)]. Adopting a 0.5% criterion for a significant deviation, we find B_{c1} = 6.0(1.0) mT, again for T = 1.85 K. This experimental value for B_{c1} is, however, only a lower limit due to the strong influence of the demagnetization effect for a nearly perfect diamagnet. From the B_{c2} value determined from magnetization and \kappa = 8.0 from Table 2, we obtain with the relation B_{c2} = \sqrt{2}\kappa\,B_{c,\rm th} a thermodynamic critical field B_{c,\rm th}\approx 48 mT, which is clearly larger than the value calculated from the free enthalpy difference from specific heat (\approx 40 mT for T = 1.85 K). Using B_{c1}\approx (ln \kappa + 0.5)B_{c,\rm th}/2\kappa (valid for small \kappa),[30] we find B_{c1} = 7.7 mT, in fair agreement with the estimate from the magnetization curve. Only slightly different values for the critical fields were obtained from similar magnetization data (not shown) taken on the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample used in Ref. [28] [B_{c1} = 4.2(1.0) mT and B_{c2} = 590(50) mT, both at T = 1.85 K].

The magnetization curve for the BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12} sample (x = 1) of the present study is given in Fig. 6. There is no visible second peak effect and, thus, the upper critical field can be determined accurately from the sharp kinks in M(B_{\rm app}) [B_{c2} = 1820(20) mT; see 100-fold magnification of the data in Fig. 6]. The estimated B_{c1} is 11.5(1.0) mT (T = 1.85 K; criterion

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c}  & \lambda & \xi & & B_{c2} (1.7 K) & \rho_{0} \\ x & (nm) & (nm) & \kappa & (T) & (\mu\Omega cm) \\

While the B_{c2} value is only slightly lower compared to the one in Table 2, the GL parameter \kappa\approx 13.1 is clearly lower than the value determined by \muSR spectroscopy. The B_{c,\text{th}} calculated using \kappa from Table 2 and B_{c2} from the magnetization curve is \approx 99 mT, which is again clearly larger than the value derived from the specific heat data (\approx 79 mT at 1.85 K).

In Fig. 7 the difference of the specific heat \Delta c_{p}(T)=c_{p}(B_{\text{app}})-c_{p}(B>B_{c2}) is plotted for the present BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample. For fields \geqslant 600 mT no SC signal is observed above our lowest temperature of 1.8 K. The midpoints of the second-order-type transitions T_{c}(B_{\text{app}}) were evaluated. The quadratic extrapolation of these data for B_{c2}(T) to zero temperature results in B_{c2}(0)=470(50) mT, in excellent agreement with the values from \muSR and magnetization. For the sample used in Ref. [28] we extrapolate B_{c2}(0)=540(50) mT. Specific-heat data in field for the other compositions are given in Ref. [28].

The electrical resistivity of the present x=0 sample at 300 K is \approx 90 \mu_m_ than with a residual resistance ratio 6.1 [Fig. 8(b)]. Such low residual resistivity ratio (RRR) values are not typical for polycrystalline samples of other MPt_{4}Ge_{12} compounds [cf. RRR = 33 or 42 (Ref. [15]], RRR \approx 100 (Ref. [16]), or RRR \geqslant 100 (Ref. [46]). Obviously, the crystalline quality of polycrystalline BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} samples is worse compared to that of other members of the family of filled Pt-Ge skutterudites. RRR \approx 6, however, indicates that a BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample with a clearly lower defect concentration than in Refs. [14] or [47] has been achieved. For the present sample the SC transition in \rho(T,B_{\text{app}}) decreases continuous with increasing field, except for very low fields [Fig. 8(a)]. The onset, mid, and zero-resistance temperatures are plotted against B_{\text{app}} in Fig. 8(c). Surprisingly, the transition in \rho(T) is still complete for a field of 1.0 T and the onset is even visible at 1.9 K in 1.8 T. Such high upper critical fields are in agreement with the conclusions in Ref. [14], but in strong contrast to the consistently much lower B_{c2} values obtained from the bulk probes \muSR, magnetization, and specific heat. A quadratic extrapolation of T_{\text{c,mid}} (range of fit 0.2-1.2 T) to zero temperature results in B_{c2}^{\text{res}}(0)=1460 mT [dashed line in Fig. 8(c)]. In addition, a clear anomaly is seen for the lowest fields, where the resistive T_{c} is almost 0.5 K higher than expected from the extrapolation curve. Actually, the extrapolated resistive T_{\text{c,mid}}(0)\approx 4.74 K agrees well with that from the bulk measurements. For the sample of BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12} no significant discrepancy between bulk and resistive value for B_{c2} is found (see Ref. [28]).

What is the origin of this discrepancy in the B_{c2} and T_{c}(0) values from bulk properties and resistivity in BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}? In the low-field susceptibility (B_{\text{app}}=2 mT, \muSR sample) a bulk T_{c} onset of 4.87 K is observed (determined by the tangent to the steepest slope of the field-cooling Meissner

  transition). However, above \approx5.0 K there is still a very weak diamagnetic signal, which vanishes exponentially with increasing temperature. The signal is only a little weaker in field cooling than measured after zero-field cooling (zfc), but the maximum of this zfc signal is about three orders of magnitude lower than the zfc signal at 4.0 K (or 1.5 orders of magnitude weaker than the bulk Meissner effect).

This weak diamagnetism, the concomitant zero electrical resistance, and the too large B_{c2} value from resistivity data may root in two phenomena: (i) the presence of a minor SC impurity phase which forms a percolating SC network with an \sim 0.5 K higher T_{c}(0) and much higher B_{c2} than the main phase, or (ii) strong classical surface superconductivity of the main phase with a critical field B_{c3}(0) \ggB_{c2}(0). The second possibility seems to be unlikely due to the fact that T_{\rm c,bulk}(0) \neqT_{\rm c,surface} and that the required surface critical field B_{c3} would well need to exceed the Saint-James-de Gennes limit of \approx1.7B_{c2}.[48]

For BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} no homogeneity range is observed since the lattice parameter of the filled-skutterudite phase in a sample with composition Ba_{0.9}Pt_{4}Ge_{12} is 8.6837(3) A, which is practically the same as for BaPt_{4}Ge_{12}.[26] Extended energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analyses on metallographic polished surfaces of the present BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample result in a composition Ba_{0.9(1)}Pt_{4.0(1)}Ge_{11.9(1)}, which agrees very well with the nominal one. Interestingly, there is a significant difference of the lattice parameter of all our BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} samples [present sample a = 8.6838(5) ] with that reported by Bauer _et al._[14] [a = 8.6928(3) A],[14] which we currently cannot explain.

The currently studied large BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample also contains, besides the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} main phase, some BaPtGe_{3} [no superconductivity observed above 1.8 K (Refs. [49] and [50])]. The content of this phase is estimated from Rietveld refinements to be \sim4%. Five weak lines in the x-ray diffraction pattern belong to PtGe_{2}. These lines are too weak to refine a phase content, therefore we estimate a PtGe_{2} phase fraction of below 2%. PtGe_{2} is reported to be a superconductor with T_{c} = 0.4 K.[51] The presence of these minority phases in the BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample thus also cannot explain the observation of a higher upper critical field value in resistivity data.

The resistive percolation (a SC path) at a higher temperature than the bulk T_{c} hints at a modification of the surface layers of the grains of the majority skutterudite phase, probably due to crystallographic defects or strain. These effects will result in a larger scattering rate and a shorter mean free path of the charge carriers, thus making the superconductor dirtier, subsequently enlarging the effective penetration depth well above the bulk value.

Since the present samples are polycrystalline pieces, an estimate of the mean free path from the residual resistivity values by the standard formula[52] is problematic and gives at best a lower limit for I. Moreover, skutterudites are not simple metals which can be treated in a one-band model. Our estimate of the minimal mean free path in BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} using a free-electron model results in I_{\rm min}\approx 25, 14, 14, and 19 nm for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively.[53] In view of these values of I_{\rm min}, the superconductivity in the bulk of the crystallites is neither in the clean nor in the dirty limit. On the surface, however, the superconductivity seems to be in the dirty limit, leading to much shorter coherence lengths than in the bulk. Hence, crystalline defects or impurities on the grain surfaces probably lead to the higher upper critical field value in resistivity data. An open question is the clearly higher T_{c} of these grain surfaces. The T_{c} of a superconductor with defects is--in most cases--lower than the T_{c} of the pure material, however, it is also known that strain, especially on surfaces, can drastically enhance the T_{c}. While the growth of single crystals of sufficient size of BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} was not successful until now, investigations on such crystals would be highly desirable.

## IV Conclusion

We performed an investigation using transverse-field \muSR spectroscopy for a series of polycrystalline BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} superconductors with x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. Highly asymmetric \muSR time spectra were analyzed within the framework of the GL theory by precise minimization of the GL free energy.[31] Zero-temperature magnetic penetration depths [\lambda(0)] and GL parameters (\kappa = \lambda/\xi) were evaluated (see Table 2). The temperature dependence of the superfluid density \rho_{s} in all the compounds saturates exponentially in the low-temperature limit, which documents the absence of nodes in the superconducting gap function. This finding is in agreement with the results of a previous NMR study.[25] Our analysis shows that \rho_{s} is well described within the classical s-wave BCS model with gap-to-T_{c} ratios (\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}) of 1.70, 2.07, 2.15, and 2.02 for x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, respectively. These ratios are in fair agreement with the reduced specific-heat jump \delta c_{P}/\gamma_{N}T_{c} from our previous study.[28] The observation of field-independent \lambda values further supports the classical s-wave pairing scenario for these compounds. Thus, the present experimental results from bulk probes point to the classical s-wave phonon-mediated superconductivity for all compounds in the series BaPt_{4-x}Au_{x}Ge_{12} up to x = 1. The upper critical field data from the \muSR study are in good agreement with bulk-sensitive thermodynamic measurements of the upper critical fields of BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} and BaPt_{3}AuGe_{12}. The origin of much higher upper critical fields observed in electrical resistivity measurements for the present BaPt_{4}Ge_{12} sample (as in previous reports[14, 15, 28]) is due to a larger carrier scattering rate at the surface of the crystallites.

## Appendix A Details of calculations and GL definitions

Below we describe some details of our calculations and introduce the basic definitions of the GL theory used in this  analysis. As shown by Abrikosov, a type II superconductor forms a periodic vortex or FLL in a range of magnetic fields (B).[54] Here, B_{c1}<B<B_{c2}, where B_{c1} and B_{c2} are the lower and upper critical fields, respectively. The GL theory used by Abrikosov proved to be one of the most useful approaches for the evaluation of the field distribution in a type II superconductor (although it is strictly valid only close to T_{c}) and forms the basis for the analysis of TF \muSR data.

For the limiting cases of \kappa\rightarrow\infty (\kappa=\lambda/\xi is the GL parameter) and B_{c1}<B\ll B_{c2} simplified, second moment analysis methods were developed.[30, 55] In the general case of arbitrary \kappa and B, the solution is more complicated and various approximations have been suggested.[32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] A feasible and precise minimization algorithm of the "classical" GL free energy has been suggested by Brandt.[31] The method was first used in the experimental work in Ref. [61]. The difference between the SC and the normal-state free energies \Delta F=F_{s}-F_{u} is expressed (in SI units) as[35, 62, 31]

\[\Delta F=\alpha|\psi|^{2}+\frac{\beta}{2}|\psi|^{4}+\frac{1}{2m^{*}}\left| \left(\frac{\hbar}{i}\nabla-2e\mathbf{A}\right)\psi\right|^{2}+\frac{\mathbf{ B}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}.\] (1)

Here, \mathbf{B=}\operatorname{rot}\mathbf{A}, the parameter \beta=(\kappa e\hbar/m)^{2}\mu_{0}/2 is determined by the GL parameter \kappa, and \psi_{0}^{2}=-\alpha/\beta>0. The parameter \psi_{0}^{2} is the superfluid density deep in the bulk of the superconductor in the limit of low fields (i.e., in the Meissner state), which is related to the magnetic penetration depth \lambda. The relation between \lambda^{-2} and \psi_{0}^{2} is (in SI units)[62]

\[\lambda^{-2}=\frac{4\mu_{0}e^{2}}{m^{*}}\psi_{0}^{2}.\] (2)

In an applied field, however, the superfluid density |\psi|^{2} is spatially inhomogeneous with minima at the vortex cores due to the formation of a FLL.[54] Figure 9 shows the spatial variation of |\psi(\mathbf{r})|^{2}/\psi_{0}^{2} at different reduced fields b=\langle B\rangle/B_{c2} in the limit of \kappa\rightarrow\infty corresponding to the minimum of Eq. (1) (\langle B\rangle is the mean field in the sample). Although \lambda is field independent (as well as \alpha and \beta) and finite at T=T_{c}^{B_{c2}}\equiv T_{c}(B\neq 0), the superfluid density reduces with increasing field and vanishes at T=T_{c}^{B_{c2}}. Therefore, with increasing field for b\gtrsim 0.05 (e.g., for a non-high-T_{c} superconductor; see Fig. 9) the correction factor (1-b) to the superfluid density becomes significant. The mean value of the superfluid density reduces with increasing field as follows:[30, 51]

\[\rho_{s}=\langle|\psi|^{2}\rangle\simeq(1-b)\psi_{0}^{2}.\] (3)

For small values of b\to 0 and high \kappa, as in most of the high-T_{c} superconductors, we have \rho_{s}\propto\lambda^{-2}. In the present analysis the free energy [Eq. (1)] for the given \lambda, \xi, and \langle B\rangle was minimized using the method suggested by Brandt.[31] This results in a solution for spatial variation of the field \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}) and the order parameter \psi(\mathbf{r}).

## Appendix B Some details on Eq. (5)

We use Eq. (5) suggested in Ref. [36] for the case of arbitrary scattering rate 1/\tau (mean free path l=v_{F}\tau). For the classical BCS gap-to-T_{c} ratio \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.76 the temperature dependence of the normalized superfluid density \lambda_{0}^{2}/\lambda^{2}(t) obtained with Eq. (5) in clean (\tau\gg\xi_{\rm cl}/v_{F}) and dirty (\tau\ll\xi_{\rm cl}/v_{F}) limits is given in Fig. 10 (t=T/T_{c}). The results are in good agreement with curves given in Ref. [35]. Note, the shape of \lambda_{0}^{2}/\lambda^{2}(t) depends on the scattering rate only for \tau\sim\xi_{\rm cl}/v_{F}. For the current precision of measurement the parameters \Delta_{0} and \tau are correlated. The dirty-limit curve with \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.76 can be well fitted with the clean-limit model with \Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}=2.0 (see Fig. 10).

Figure 10: (Color online) Temperature dependence of normalized superfluid density \lambda_{0}^{2}/\lambda^{2}(t) in clean and dirty limits (t=T/T_{c}). In open circles \lambda_{0}^{2}/\lambda^{2}(t) in the clean limit but larger gap-to-T_{c} ratio is shown.

* [48]Small and unphysical reduction (\simeq5% in the field range of 50-640 mT) of \lambda, with increasing field was obtained for the value of \xi determined from the corresponding B_{c2} (using the GL relation B_{c2}=\Phi_{0}/2\pi\xi^{2}). Such deviation rather points to a slight systematic deviation of vortex lattice field distribution from that of the ideal GL vortex lattice.
