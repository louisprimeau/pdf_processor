###### Abstract

We have investigated the effects of isoelectronic Nb^{5+} and hole-doping Sn^{4+} substitutions for Ru^{5+} on the magnetic and electronic properties of RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} that displays superconductivity and magnetic order. We find a rapid increase in the Meissner state onset temperature when the magnetic order is completely destroyed by Sn substitution, which we show is consistent with the spontaneous vortex phase model. The temperature characterizing the ferromagnetic component, T_{M}^{*}, and the saturation magnetization, M_{x}, decreases more rapidly for hole-doping by Sn than for nearly isoelectronic doping by Nb. We propose a ferrimagnetic picture to explain the magnetization data.

## Introduction

The ruthenocuprates, RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} (_R_=rare earth), are interesting CuO_{2} and RuO_{2} layered compounds that display superconductivity and magnetic order.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] Despite extensive studies, the nature of magnetic order in these compounds is still an issue of great debate. RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} was initially believed to be ferromagnetic. However, recent neutron-diffraction data revealed that RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} is antiferromagnetically ordered with a small ferromagnetic component.[8, 10] A spin-flop transition to a ferromagnetic state occurs as the magnetic field is increased.[9]

Unfortunately there are no neutron-diffraction data available for RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and hence it is not possible to uniquely determine the magnetic structure. Synchrotron x-ray measurements show significant rotation and tilting of the RuO_{6} octahedra[12, 13] that form coherent domains at low temperature for x = 1 as evidenced by zone folded Raman peaks.[14] Magnetization measurements reveal a large ferromagnetic component at low temperatures that can be characterized by T_{M}^{*}, which is the temperature where the maximum negative gradient occurs. This T_{M}^{*} is \sim115 K for x = 1.0 and decreases to \sim55 K for x = 0.4.[11] It has been suggested from magnetization measurements that RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} antiferromagnetically orders at temperature of up to \sim190 K,[3] and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya antisymmetric exchange coupling induces spin-canting that results in a weak ferromagnetic component below\sim190 K.[3] The large ferromagnetic component that occurs at lower temperatures is believed to arise from additional Ru-Ru superexchange. Unlike RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}, the saturation field of RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (\sim0.2 T) is small and there is no evidence of a spin-flop transition. The large saturation magnetization at low temperatures (\sim1 \mu_{B} per Ru) appears to be too large to be attributed to spin-canting and antiferromagnetism, hence it is possible that the low-temperature magnetic order is ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic.

A number of studies have provided evidence for the coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity.[6, 15] This coexistence has been explained by a spontaneous vortex phase (SVP) model.[4, 7] In the SVP model, the transition to the Meissner state occurs at the temperature T_{\text{Meissner}}\leqT_{c}, where T_{c} is the superconducting transition temperature. A SVP can exist for T_{\text{Meissner}}<T<T<T_{c} if the superconducting sample is also magnetically ordered with a ferromagnetic component and the internal field is greater than the superconducting lower critical field. For T\leqT_{\text{Meissner}}, the superconducting lower critical field is assumed to be greater than the internal field from the ferromagnetic component, hence full diamagnetic shielding occurs at low temperatures. When the magnetic order is suppressed, it is expected that T_{\text{Meissner}}=T_{c}. Magnetization measurements on Ru_{1-y}Sn_{y}Sr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} support the SVP model, where it was found that T_{c}-T_{\text{Meissner}} decreases as the concentration of Sn increases and hence the magnetic ordering temperature decreases.[16]

To better understand the superconducting and magnetic states, we performed magnetization and transport measurements on RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} where Sn^{4+} and Nb^{5+} were substituted for Ru, and we report the results in this paper. These two substituents were chosen because the Ru valence is believed to be near 5+.[17, 18] Hence, Nb^{5+} is expected to be an isoelectronic substitution while Sn^{4+} should also lead to hole-doping. We show below that Sn^{4+} substitution in the superconducting x = 0.8 samples is consistent with the SVP model and Sn^{4+} and Nb^{5+} substitutions in the nonsuperconducting x = 1.0 compound both lead to a decrease in T_{M}^{*}. Furthermore, the magnetization data can be interpreted in terms of ferrimagnetic order.

## Experimental details

Polycrystalline Ru_{1-y}Sn_{y}Sr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and Ru_{1-y}Nb_{y}Sr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} samples for this study were made using a method described elsewhere.[11, 16] The samples were analyzed using x-ray diffraction with a Co _K\alpha_ x-ray tube. There was no evidence of impurity phases in the x-ray-diffraction data. Electrical resistivity measurements were made using the standard four-terminal technique. Room temperature thermoelectric power measurements were made using the standard differential temperature method. The ac (ac field = 5 x 10-6 T and frequency = 333 Hz) and dc magnetization measurements were made using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer for temperatures up to 400 K.

## RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

We first discuss the results from measurements on the superconducting Ru1-ySn,Sr2Eu1,2Ce0.8Cu2O10-b samples (_x_ = 0.8). This level of Ce doping is on the boundary of the superconducting phase diagram where superconductivity is observed for 0.2 <= x 0.8.11 The normalized resistivity data are plotted in Fig. 1(a) for y = 0 (solid line), 0.1 (dashed line), and 0.2 (dotted line). As in previous studies,19 we take T_{c}, the superconducting critical temperature, as the temperature where the resistivity of the sample starts to decrease. It is apparent that the addition of Sn does not change T_{c} significantly. This suggests that the holes doped by Sn4+ substitution do not appear on the CuO2 plane. The extra holes induced by Sn4+ substitution could be localized in the RuO2 plane or they could be compensated by a decreasing oxygen content.

The doping state can be estimated from the room-temperature thermoelectric power, _S_(290 K), versus hole concentration correlation that has been reported for a wide range of high-temperature superconducting cuprates (HTSCs).20 We find that _S_(290 K) is 20.6 _m_V/K for y = 0, 28.6 _m_V/K for y = 0.1, and 23.8 _m_V/K for y = 0.2. Using the correlation found in other HTSCs, we estimate that the number of doped holes per Cu, p, falls in the range of 0.093 <_p_ < 0.101 for these samples. For such a small change in p, the change in T_{c} will not be significant,21 and this is consistent with the results we obtained. Therefore, the addition of Sn into the RuO2 layers does not affect T_{c}.

Information about _T_Meissner can be obtained from the real (_kh_') and the imaginary (_kh_') parts of the ac magnetization plotted in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) for Ru1-ySn,Sr2Eu1,2Ce0.8Cu2O10-b. It is clear that the ferromagnetic component of the magnetic order is visible for Ru1-ySn,Sr2Eu1,2Ce0.8Cu2O10-b with y = 0 and 0.1 (solid and dashed lines, respectively), and that this ferromagnetic component disappears for y = 0.2 (dotted lines). Thus, the substitution of Sn for Ru suppresses T_{M}. To characterize the disappearance of the ferromagnetic component, we calculate the temperature at which _dx_'/_dT_ has a maximum negative value as 87.0, 30.0, and 0 K for y = 0, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The suppression rate for Ru1-ySn,Sr2Eu1,2Ce0.8Cu2O10-b is 5.7 K/_t_/_%_ Sn, which corresponds to an initial decrease rate of \left. \delta \left( T_{M}^{\ast} (y)/T_{M}^{\ast} (0) \right) \right|/_g_ = 6.6.

Similar to previous studies,317 we take _T_Meissner as the temperature at which _kh_' = 0. It is apparent that _T_Meissner changes when the Sn fraction is changed, and _T_Meissner approaches the value of T_{c} when the ferromagnetic component disappears at y = 0.2. This is clearly illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1(a), where we plot _D_T_ = T_{c} - _T_Meissner versus the Sn fraction. Thus, when the magnetic order is suppressed, _D_T_ is much smaller. This provides direct support for the SVP model that was proposed to explain the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic order.

We now discuss the results from measurements on the nonsuperconducting Ru1-ySn,Nb),Sr2EuCeCu2O10-b samples, which allow us to focus on the magnetic properties. The resistivity data are plotted in Fig. 2(a). The first observation is that Ru1-ySn,Nb),Sr2EuCeCu2O10-b does not show evidence of superconductivity. There are two temperature regions over which the resistivity of Ru1-ySn,Nb),Sr2EuCeCu2O10-b exhibits different functional temperature dependence. For temperatures above ~80 K, there is a small decrease in the resistivity with increasing temperature except for the pure sample (_y_ = 0), where the temperature dependence is similar to that observed in some underdoped HTSC. For temperatures below ~80 K, there is a more rapid change in the resistivity. These features can be easily seen from the inset of Fig. 2(a), where we plot the temperature dependence of the resistivity for Ru1-ySn,Nb),Sr2EuCeCu2O10-b on a log-log scale. The resistivity data below ~80 K can be fitted to a power-law temperature dependence where the exponent ranges from -0.8 to -1.1 irrespective of the dopant.

(b) Plot of the real part of the ac susceptibility against temperature and (c) plot of the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility for the same samples.

  The S(290 K) values are also consistent with very underdoped CuO_{2} planes with a hole concentration close to that where superconductivity occurs in the HTSCs. We find that _S_(290 K) is 62.6, 71.6, 100.1, 86.3, and 68.0 \muV/K for Ru_{1-y}(Sn,Nb),Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} with y = 0, 0.1, and 0.2 for Nb and y = 0.1 and 0.2 for Sn, respectively. From the correlation between p and _S_(290 K) found in a number of the HTSCs,[20] we deduce that all samples are underdoped (_p_ < 0.16) and p ranges from ~0.04 to ~0.06. These values are near the border (_p_ = 0.05) where superconductivity is observed (_p_ > 0.05). The samples with the higher _S_(290 K) (lowest _p_) also have the higher resistivity. For example, the resistivity of Ru_{0.8}Sn_{0.2}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is lower than that of Ru_{0.9}Sn_{0.1}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} because the former has a lower _S_(290 K) and hence a higher p than the latter. The resistivity of the pure RuSr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} on the other hand, is comparable to that of Ru_{0.8}Sn_{0.2}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} because of the comparable _S_(290 K) and hence comparable p. This is expected in a model where the charge transport is dominated by the CuO_{2} planes and by noting that in the HTSCs the resistivity decreases with increasing p over the deduced hole concentration range. Thus, it is not possible to determine if the RuO_{2} layers are conducting. A similar situation exists in RuSr_{2}RCu_{2}O_{3} where the charge transport is dominated by the CuO_{2} planes. However, from anomalous Hall effect measurements it was possible to deduce an itinerant metallic state in the RuO_{2} planes.[22]

The effect of substituents on the magnetization data can be seen in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) where the zero-field-cooled M/H data are plotted for Ru_{1-y}Nb_{y}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [Fig. 2(b)] and Ru_{1-y}Sn_{y}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [Fig. 2(c)] measured at 25 mT. Following the method described in the earlier section, we find that T_{M}^{*} for Nb-substituted samples decreases from 125 K for y = 0 to 80 K for y = 0.1 and to 60 K for y = 0.2. For the Sn-substituted samples, T_{M}^{*} is 125, 66, and 30 K for y = 0, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. Thus, Nb and Sn both suppress T_{M}^{*} and Sn substitution leads to a greater suppression rate. This is clearer in Fig. 3, where T_{M}^{*} is plotted against the substituent concentration y. The rates of suppression, estimated from the slope of the dashed lines, are 3.7 K/% Nb and 5.2 K/% Sn. These correspond to \delta(T_{M}^{*}(_y_)/T_{M}^{*}(0)]/_g_ of 3.0 and 4.2, respectively. The rate of suppression of T_{M}^{*} by Sn and Nb is comparable to that found in antiferromagnetically ordered Ru_{1-y}Sn_{y}Sr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}, where \delta(T_{N}(_y_)/T_{N}(0)]/_g_ = 3.8 and T_{N} is the Neel temperature.[16] The rates of suppression are also similar to those found in the quasi-2D antiferromagnetic compounds La_{2}Cu_{1-x}Mg_{x}O_{4} (\delta(T_{N}(_y_)/T_{N}(0)]/_g_ \sim 3.0 (Ref. [23])) and La_{2}Cu_{1-y}(Mg_{x}Zn)_{y}O_{4}(\delta(T_{N}(_y_)/T_{N}(0)]/_g_ \sim 3.7 (Ref. [24])). In the case of La_{2}Cu_{1-y}(Mg_{x}Zn)_{y}O_{4}, the suppression of T_{N} was consistent with a randomly site diluted nearest-neighbor square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a site percolation threshold of y ~ 0.41.[24] Although the nature of the magnetic order in RuSr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is not clear, the comparison with La_{2}Cu_{1-y}(Mg_{x}Zn)_{y}O_{4} suggests that the decrease in T_{M}^{*} may arise from random site dilution.

The low-temperature magnetic state was probed by magnetization measurements as a function of applied field. The resultant data are plotted in Fig. 4 for measurements on Ru_{1-y}(Sn,Nb)_{y}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} at 5 K and after subtracting the Van Vleck paramagnetic contribution from Eu^{3+}(^{7}F_{0}). The Van Vleck contribution was calculated in a manner similar to that done in a previous high-temperature susceptibility study on RuSr_{2}EuCu_{2}O_{8},[25] and we used a spin-orbit coupling constant of 303 cm^{-1} as measured in Eu_{2}CuO_{4}.[26] The magnetic moment per formula unit (f.u.) is plotted in units of the Bohr magneton, \mu_{B}, and we find that it increases rapidly at relatively low applied magnetic field where the saturation

  field is \sim0.2 T. Similar to previous studies, we find that the remanent magnetization (0.42_m__g_/f.u.) and 6 T magnetization (1.14_m__g_/f.u.) from the pure compound are large and there is no evidence for a spin-flop transition. These features are the typical characteristics of ferromagnetically or ferrimagnetically ordered materials.

It is apparent in Fig. 4 that the introduction of substituents into the ruthenium layers decreases the high-field moment per Ru site. The high-field moment per Ru site at 6 T is 1.14_m__g_/f.u. for RuSr2EuCeCu2O10-_d_. If RuSr2EuCeCu2O10-_d_ is ferromagnetic and Ru52+ is in the high-spin state (_S_ = 3/2), then the saturation moment is expected to be 3_m__g_, as calculated from M_{s} = _gS_, where g is the Lande g factor, which is taken as 2.00, and S is the total spin. If Ru54 is in the low-spin state (_S_ = 1/2), then the saturation moment is expected to be 1_m__B_. The moment obtained at 6 T is close to the saturation moment of Ru5+ in low-spin state, which suggests ferromagnetic order and a low-spin electronic configuration. However, we show later that this possibility is inconsistent with the high-temperature effective moment in the Curie-Weiss regime, and ferrimagnetic order is possible.

The high-field magnetization is linear in H and we use a linear extrapolation of the high-field magnetization to estimate the saturation magnetization, M_{s}. For the pure compound M_{s} = 1.07_m__g_/f.u., which is slightly smaller than the value at 6 T. M_{s} is plotted against the Sn or Nb fraction in the right lower inset to Fig. 4. We find that the rate of suppression is more rapid for Sn substituted samples. The rate of suppression for Sn substitution appears to be too large to be accounted for within a randomly site diluted nearest-neighbor 2D Heisenberg model.24 However, the Monte Carlo simulations were done for S = 1/2 and we show later that the magnetic order may be ferrimagnetic with a mixture of S = 1/2 and 3/2. This may affect the rate at which M_{s} is suppressed. A complete analysis can only be done when neutron-diffraction data are available and when Monte Carlo simulations are made that take into account the possible ferrimagnetic order.

While _T__M__s_ and M_{s} are more rapidly suppressed by Sn substitution, we find a linear correlation between M_{s} and _T__M__s_ for Sn and Nb that can be seen in Fig. 5. The linear correlation is evident by the solid line, which is a linear fit to the data. Thus, while Sn suppresses _T__M__s_ faster than Nb, we find a common M_{s}(_T__M__s_) for the Sn and Nb concentrations studied. A linear correlation is found in RuSr2EuCu2O8, where Sn is partially substituted for Ru and where M_{s} is measured at 6 T.16

Additional information about the magnetic state can be obtained from the effective moment in the Curie-Weiss temperature regime where _M_/_H_ is independent of _H_(>175 K). Typical data are plotted in Fig. 6 for the pure compound (open circles). The data can be understood by noting that _M_/_H_ can be written as

Figure 6: Plot of raw _M_/_H_ data against temperature up to 400 K for RuSr2EuCeCu2O10−_δ_ (open circles). The solid line is the fit to the data using Eq. (1) and the dashed line is the Van Vleck paramagnetic contribution of Eu3+ as described in the text.

  \[\frac{M}{H}=\frac{C}{T-\vartheta}+\chi_{\rm VV}(T)+\chi_{0}.\] (1)

The first term in Eq. (1) is the Curie-Weiss term from the Ru moments, where \vartheta is the Curie-Weiss temperature and the Curie constant is

\[C=\frac{N}{V}\frac{\mu_{0}P_{\rm eff}^{2}\mu_{B}^{2}(1-y)}{3k_{B}},\] (2)

where \mu_{0} is the vacuum permeability, P_{\rm eff} is the effective moment per Ru in units of \mu_{B}, k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, (1-y) is the number of Ru atoms per f.u., and N/V is the number of Ru atoms per unit volume in the pure compound. The second term in Eq. (1) is the Van Vleck susceptibility from Eu3+(^{2}F_{0}). The Van Vleck susceptibility from Eu3+ is plotted in Fig. 6 (dashed curve). The third term accounts for the susceptibility from the CuO2 planes and any temperature-independent susceptibility from the RuO2 planes. The spin susceptibility from the CuO2 planes in the HTSCs is small (<0.4\times10^{-4}, Ref. [27]) and hence we approximate it as a constant for temperatures above 175 K.

It can be seen in Fig. 6 that Eq. (1) provides a good fit to the data (solid curve). After fitting the data for the Sn-substituted samples, we find that \vartheta is 138, 127, and 95 K for y=0, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The measured P_{\rm eff} are plotted in Fig. 7 for the Sn-substituted (filled circles) samples. Thus, we find that the Curie-Weiss temperature decreases while P_{\rm eff} remains nearly the same for increasing Sn concentration. The value we obtained for the pure 1.0Ce sample is 3.10\pm0.15/Ru. This value is close to that obtained by Butera _et al._ (cross, 3.07/Ru).[28] However, it is significantly greater than the value obtained by Felner _et al._ (open triangle, 2.13/Ru).[29] None of these P_{\rm eff} values corresponds to any of the theoretical values calculated from various high- and low-spin states of Ru4+ and Ru5+ (dashed lines).

The value of P_{\rm eff}=3.10\pm0.15/Ru for the pure 1.0Ce suggests the existence of a mixed valence. This has already been observed in RuSr2RCu2O8, where \sim40-50 % Ru4+ and \sim60-50 % Ru5+ has been deduced from magnetization,[30] nuclear magnetic resonance,[31, 32] and x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) (Ref. [33]) data. However, a mixed Ru4+ and Ru5+ valence is unlikely in RuSr2EuCeCu2O10+-\delta because the predicated valence is inconsistent with the Ru valence near 5+ that was measured by XANES.[18] The Ru valence required to account for the measured effective moment can be estimated from

\[P_{\rm eff}^{\rm tot}=\sqrt{f_{4+}(P_{\rm eff}^{\rm eff})^{2}+f_{5+}(P_{\rm eff }^{\rm 5+})^{2}},\] (3)

where f_{4+},f_{5+} are the fractions of Ru4+ and Ru5+, respectively, and P_{\rm eff}^{\rm 4+} and P_{\rm eff}^{\rm 5+} are the effective moments for Ru4+ and Ru5+, which can be obtained from P_{\rm eff}^{\rm e}=g\sqrt{S_{\rm e}(S_{\rm e}+1)}. Taking S_{4+}=1, S_{5+}=3/2, and P_{\rm eff}^{\rm tot}=3.1/Ru, it can be calculated that 77% of Ru4+ and 23% of Ru5+ are required, which makes the effective valence of +4.23. However, the valence of +4.23 is inconsistent with the \sim +5 valence obtained using other experimental methods.[17, 18]

It has been suggested by Felner _et al.[29]_ that Ru5+ is in a low-spin configuration with S_{\rm LS}=1/2, however it can be seen in Fig. 7 that 100% of Ru5+ in the low-spin configuration cannot account for the measured effective moment. Therefore, we propose a mixture of Ru5+ in the low-spin configuration with S_{\rm LS}=1/2 and the high-spin configuration with S_{\rm HS}=3/2. According to Hund's rule, the stable electronic configuration of Ru5+ for a perfect octahedral crystal field would have three valence electrons occupying the lower three t_{2g} orbitals, which leads to the high-spin state with S_{\rm HS}=3/2. However, octahedral distortion can lead to a splitting of the lower t_{2g} orbitals into one higher-energy and two lower-energy orbitals. This is observed in some other transition-metal oxides, including the HTSCs.[34] Thus, the low-spin configuration could arise from regions with distorted octahedra where only the two lower t_{2g} levels are occupied and leading to the low-spin S_{\rm LS}=1/2 suggestion of Felner _et al.[29]_ By repeating the calculation above, we obtain f_{\rm HS}\sim 55% and f_{\rm LS}\sim 45% for the fractions of Ru5+ in its high-spin state and low-spin state, respectively, for the pure compound.

To maintain overall charge neutrality, the partial substitution of Sn4+ for Ru5+ needs to be compensated for by an increase in the Ru valence, a decrease in the Cu valence, or a reduction in the oxygen content. If the main change is a reduction in the oxygen content and a small change in the Cu valence, then it is possible that the Ru valence remains at 5+ at least for up to 0.2 Sn. In this scenario, the fraction of Ru atoms in the low-spin and high-spin configurations might not be expected to change with increasing Sn concentration.

Figure 7: Plot of the effective Bohr magneton number P_{\rm eff} for Ru1,,ySn,Sr,Fe2EuCeCu2O10+-\delta with different Sn fractions (filled circles). The cross is the data of Butera _et al._ (Ref. [28]) and the open triangle is the data of Felner _et al._ (Ref. [29]), both for RuSr2EuCeCu2O10+-\delta (i.e., y=0). The theoretical values of P_{\rm eff} with different S are shown as the dashed lines in the figure and the solid line assumes a fixed Ru5+ low-spin (45%) and high-spin (55%) configuration.

  This is consistent with the data, as can be seen in Fig. 7 (solid line).

A mixture of Ru5+ high-spin and low-spin configurations as well as ferrimagnetic order can also account for the saturation magnetization at low temperatures. Taking the f1NS and f1S values estimated from the Curie-Weiss temperature regime and assuming that the low-spin and high-spin moments are antiparallel results in a saturation moment of ~1.2_m__B_/f.u., which is close to the measured value of 1.07_m__B_/f.u. When the experimental uncertainty in the measured _P_eff is accounted for, we obtain an expected saturation moment of 1.16 +- 0.24_m__B_/f.u.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have probed the superconducting and magnetic order in RuSr2Eu2-Ce2Cu2O10+-d by the partial substitution of Ru5+ by Nb5+ and Sn4+, which are isoelectronic and hole dopants, respectively. For superconducting and magnetically ordered RuSr2Eu1.2Ce0.8Cu2O10+-d we found a rapid suppression of the ferromagnetic component when Sn is partially substituted for Ru. In addition, we observed a decrease in _T__c_-_T_Meissner when the ferromagnetic component disappeared, which provides support for the spontaneous vortex phase model that is believed to account for the coexistence of magnetic and superconducting order.

The magnetic order was probed in nonsuperconducting RuSr2EuCeCu2O10+-d. We found that T_{M}^{\ast} and M_{s} are suppressed by Sn4+ and Nb5+ but the suppression is more rapid for Sn4+. Even though T_{M}^{\ast} and M_{s} are suppressed at different rates by Sn4+ and Nb5+, we find that M_{s} is a linear function of T_{M}^{\ast} and the Sn4+ and Nb5+ data fall on a common curve. We have shown that the high-temperature effective moment can be accounted for by a mixture of high-spin and low-spin Ru5+ electronic configurations and this model is also consistent with the nearly Sn concentration independent change in the effective moment. It is also possible within this model to account for the low-temperature saturation moment in terms of ferrimagnetic order.

###### Abstract

We have investigated the effects of isoelectronic Nb^{5+} and hole-doping Sn^{4+} substitutions for Ru^{5+} on the magnetic and electronic properties of RuSr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} that displays superconductivity and magnetic order. We find a rapid increase in the Meissner state onset temperature when the magnetic order is completely destroyed by Sn substitution, which we show is consistent with the spontaneous vortex phase model. The temperature characterizing the ferromagnetic component, T_{M}^{*}, and the saturation magnetization, M_{x}, decreases more rapidly for hole-doping by Sn than for nearly isoelectronic doping by Nb. We propose a ferrimagnetic picture to explain the magnetization data.

## Introduction

The ruthenocuprates, RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} (_R_=rare earth), are interesting CuO_{2} and RuO_{2} layered compounds that display superconductivity and magnetic order.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] Despite extensive studies, the nature of magnetic order in these compounds is still an issue of great debate. RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} was initially believed to be ferromagnetic. However, recent neutron-diffraction data revealed that RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} is antiferromagnetically ordered with a small ferromagnetic component.[8, 10] A spin-flop transition to a ferromagnetic state occurs as the magnetic field is increased.[9]

Unfortunately there are no neutron-diffraction data available for RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and hence it is not possible to uniquely determine the magnetic structure. Synchrotron x-ray measurements show significant rotation and tilting of the RuO_{6} octahedra[12, 13] that form coherent domains at low temperature for x = 1 as evidenced by zone folded Raman peaks.[14] Magnetization measurements reveal a large ferromagnetic component at low temperatures that can be characterized by T_{M}^{*}, which is the temperature where the maximum negative gradient occurs. This T_{M}^{*} is \sim115 K for x = 1.0 and decreases to \sim55 K for x = 0.4.[11] It has been suggested from magnetization measurements that RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} antiferromagnetically orders at temperature of up to \sim190 K,[3] and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya antisymmetric exchange coupling induces spin-canting that results in a weak ferromagnetic component below\sim190 K.[3] The large ferromagnetic component that occurs at lower temperatures is believed to arise from additional Ru-Ru superexchange. Unlike RuSr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8}, the saturation field of RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} (\sim0.2 T) is small and there is no evidence of a spin-flop transition. The large saturation magnetization at low temperatures (\sim1 \mu_{B} per Ru) appears to be too large to be attributed to spin-canting and antiferromagnetism, hence it is possible that the low-temperature magnetic order is ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic.

A number of studies have provided evidence for the coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity.[6, 15] This coexistence has been explained by a spontaneous vortex phase (SVP) model.[4, 7] In the SVP model, the transition to the Meissner state occurs at the temperature T_{\text{Meissner}}\leqT_{c}, where T_{c} is the superconducting transition temperature. A SVP can exist for T_{\text{Meissner}}<T<T<T_{c} if the superconducting sample is also magnetically ordered with a ferromagnetic component and the internal field is greater than the superconducting lower critical field. For T\leqT_{\text{Meissner}}, the superconducting lower critical field is assumed to be greater than the internal field from the ferromagnetic component, hence full diamagnetic shielding occurs at low temperatures. When the magnetic order is suppressed, it is expected that T_{\text{Meissner}}=T_{c}. Magnetization measurements on Ru_{1-y}Sn_{y}Sr_{2}_R_Cu_{2}O_{8} support the SVP model, where it was found that T_{c}-T_{\text{Meissner}} decreases as the concentration of Sn increases and hence the magnetic ordering temperature decreases.[16]

To better understand the superconducting and magnetic states, we performed magnetization and transport measurements on RuSr_{2}_R_2-_x_Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} where Sn^{4+} and Nb^{5+} were substituted for Ru, and we report the results in this paper. These two substituents were chosen because the Ru valence is believed to be near 5+.[17, 18] Hence, Nb^{5+} is expected to be an isoelectronic substitution while Sn^{4+} should also lead to hole-doping. We show below that Sn^{4+} substitution in the superconducting x = 0.8 samples is consistent with the SVP model and Sn^{4+} and Nb^{5+} substitutions in the nonsuperconducting x = 1.0 compound both lead to a decrease in T_{M}^{*}. Furthermore, the magnetization data can be interpreted in terms of ferrimagnetic order.

## Experimental details

Polycrystalline Ru_{1-y}Sn_{y}Sr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} and Ru_{1-y}Nb_{y}Sr_{2}Eu_{2-x}Ce_{x}Cu_{2}O_{10+\delta} samples for this study were made using a method described elsewhere.[11, 16] The samples were analyzed using x-ray diffraction with a Co _K\alpha_ x-ray tube. There was no evidence of impurity phases in the x-ray-diffraction data. Electrical resistivity measurements were made using the standard four-terminal technique. Room temperature thermoelectric power measurements were made using the standard differential temperature method. The ac (ac field = 5 x 10-6 T and frequency = 333 Hz) and dc magnetization measurements were made using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer for temperatures up to 400 K.

## RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

We first discuss the results from measurements on the superconducting Ru1-ySn,Sr2Eu1,2Ce0.8Cu2O10-b samples (_x_ = 0.8). This level of Ce doping is on the boundary of the superconducting phase diagram where superconductivity is observed for 0.2 <= x 0.8.11 The normalized resistivity data are plotted in Fig. 1(a) for y = 0 (solid line), 0.1 (dashed line), and 0.2 (dotted line). As in previous studies,19 we take T_{c}, the superconducting critical temperature, as the temperature where the resistivity of the sample starts to decrease. It is apparent that the addition of Sn does not change T_{c} significantly. This suggests that the holes doped by Sn4+ substitution do not appear on the CuO2 plane. The extra holes induced by Sn4+ substitution could be localized in the RuO2 plane or they could be compensated by a decreasing oxygen content.

The doping state can be estimated from the room-temperature thermoelectric power, _S_(290 K), versus hole concentration correlation that has been reported for a wide range of high-temperature superconducting cuprates (HTSCs).20 We find that _S_(290 K) is 20.6 _m_V/K for y = 0, 28.6 _m_V/K for y = 0.1, and 23.8 _m_V/K for y = 0.2. Using the correlation found in other HTSCs, we estimate that the number of doped holes per Cu, p, falls in the range of 0.093 <_p_ < 0.101 for these samples. For such a small change in p, the change in T_{c} will not be significant,21 and this is consistent with the results we obtained. Therefore, the addition of Sn into the RuO2 layers does not affect T_{c}.

Information about _T_Meissner can be obtained from the real (_kh_') and the imaginary (_kh_') parts of the ac magnetization plotted in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) for Ru1-ySn,Sr2Eu1,2Ce0.8Cu2O10-b. It is clear that the ferromagnetic component of the magnetic order is visible for Ru1-ySn,Sr2Eu1,2Ce0.8Cu2O10-b with y = 0 and 0.1 (solid and dashed lines, respectively), and that this ferromagnetic component disappears for y = 0.2 (dotted lines). Thus, the substitution of Sn for Ru suppresses T_{M}. To characterize the disappearance of the ferromagnetic component, we calculate the temperature at which _dx_'/_dT_ has a maximum negative value as 87.0, 30.0, and 0 K for y = 0, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The suppression rate for Ru1-ySn,Sr2Eu1,2Ce0.8Cu2O10-b is 5.7 K/_t_/_%_ Sn, which corresponds to an initial decrease rate of \left. \delta \left( T_{M}^{\ast} (y)/T_{M}^{\ast} (0) \right) \right|/_g_ = 6.6.

Similar to previous studies,317 we take _T_Meissner as the temperature at which _kh_' = 0. It is apparent that _T_Meissner changes when the Sn fraction is changed, and _T_Meissner approaches the value of T_{c} when the ferromagnetic component disappears at y = 0.2. This is clearly illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1(a), where we plot _D_T_ = T_{c} - _T_Meissner versus the Sn fraction. Thus, when the magnetic order is suppressed, _D_T_ is much smaller. This provides direct support for the SVP model that was proposed to explain the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic order.

We now discuss the results from measurements on the nonsuperconducting Ru1-ySn,Nb),Sr2EuCeCu2O10-b samples, which allow us to focus on the magnetic properties. The resistivity data are plotted in Fig. 2(a). The first observation is that Ru1-ySn,Nb),Sr2EuCeCu2O10-b does not show evidence of superconductivity. There are two temperature regions over which the resistivity of Ru1-ySn,Nb),Sr2EuCeCu2O10-b exhibits different functional temperature dependence. For temperatures above ~80 K, there is a small decrease in the resistivity with increasing temperature except for the pure sample (_y_ = 0), where the temperature dependence is similar to that observed in some underdoped HTSC. For temperatures below ~80 K, there is a more rapid change in the resistivity. These features can be easily seen from the inset of Fig. 2(a), where we plot the temperature dependence of the resistivity for Ru1-ySn,Nb),Sr2EuCeCu2O10-b on a log-log scale. The resistivity data below ~80 K can be fitted to a power-law temperature dependence where the exponent ranges from -0.8 to -1.1 irrespective of the dopant.

(b) Plot of the real part of the ac susceptibility against temperature and (c) plot of the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility for the same samples.

  The S(290 K) values are also consistent with very underdoped CuO_{2} planes with a hole concentration close to that where superconductivity occurs in the HTSCs. We find that _S_(290 K) is 62.6, 71.6, 100.1, 86.3, and 68.0 \muV/K for Ru_{1-y}(Sn,Nb),Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} with y = 0, 0.1, and 0.2 for Nb and y = 0.1 and 0.2 for Sn, respectively. From the correlation between p and _S_(290 K) found in a number of the HTSCs,[20] we deduce that all samples are underdoped (_p_ < 0.16) and p ranges from ~0.04 to ~0.06. These values are near the border (_p_ = 0.05) where superconductivity is observed (_p_ > 0.05). The samples with the higher _S_(290 K) (lowest _p_) also have the higher resistivity. For example, the resistivity of Ru_{0.8}Sn_{0.2}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is lower than that of Ru_{0.9}Sn_{0.1}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} because the former has a lower _S_(290 K) and hence a higher p than the latter. The resistivity of the pure RuSr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} on the other hand, is comparable to that of Ru_{0.8}Sn_{0.2}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} because of the comparable _S_(290 K) and hence comparable p. This is expected in a model where the charge transport is dominated by the CuO_{2} planes and by noting that in the HTSCs the resistivity decreases with increasing p over the deduced hole concentration range. Thus, it is not possible to determine if the RuO_{2} layers are conducting. A similar situation exists in RuSr_{2}RCu_{2}O_{3} where the charge transport is dominated by the CuO_{2} planes. However, from anomalous Hall effect measurements it was possible to deduce an itinerant metallic state in the RuO_{2} planes.[22]

The effect of substituents on the magnetization data can be seen in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) where the zero-field-cooled M/H data are plotted for Ru_{1-y}Nb_{y}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [Fig. 2(b)] and Ru_{1-y}Sn_{y}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} [Fig. 2(c)] measured at 25 mT. Following the method described in the earlier section, we find that T_{M}^{*} for Nb-substituted samples decreases from 125 K for y = 0 to 80 K for y = 0.1 and to 60 K for y = 0.2. For the Sn-substituted samples, T_{M}^{*} is 125, 66, and 30 K for y = 0, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. Thus, Nb and Sn both suppress T_{M}^{*} and Sn substitution leads to a greater suppression rate. This is clearer in Fig. 3, where T_{M}^{*} is plotted against the substituent concentration y. The rates of suppression, estimated from the slope of the dashed lines, are 3.7 K/% Nb and 5.2 K/% Sn. These correspond to \delta(T_{M}^{*}(_y_)/T_{M}^{*}(0)]/_g_ of 3.0 and 4.2, respectively. The rate of suppression of T_{M}^{*} by Sn and Nb is comparable to that found in antiferromagnetically ordered Ru_{1-y}Sn_{y}Sr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8}, where \delta(T_{N}(_y_)/T_{N}(0)]/_g_ = 3.8 and T_{N} is the Neel temperature.[16] The rates of suppression are also similar to those found in the quasi-2D antiferromagnetic compounds La_{2}Cu_{1-x}Mg_{x}O_{4} (\delta(T_{N}(_y_)/T_{N}(0)]/_g_ \sim 3.0 (Ref. [23])) and La_{2}Cu_{1-y}(Mg_{x}Zn)_{y}O_{4}(\delta(T_{N}(_y_)/T_{N}(0)]/_g_ \sim 3.7 (Ref. [24])). In the case of La_{2}Cu_{1-y}(Mg_{x}Zn)_{y}O_{4}, the suppression of T_{N} was consistent with a randomly site diluted nearest-neighbor square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with a site percolation threshold of y ~ 0.41.[24] Although the nature of the magnetic order in RuSr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} is not clear, the comparison with La_{2}Cu_{1-y}(Mg_{x}Zn)_{y}O_{4} suggests that the decrease in T_{M}^{*} may arise from random site dilution.

The low-temperature magnetic state was probed by magnetization measurements as a function of applied field. The resultant data are plotted in Fig. 4 for measurements on Ru_{1-y}(Sn,Nb)_{y}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} at 5 K and after subtracting the Van Vleck paramagnetic contribution from Eu^{3+}(^{7}F_{0}). The Van Vleck contribution was calculated in a manner similar to that done in a previous high-temperature susceptibility study on RuSr_{2}EuCu_{2}O_{8},[25] and we used a spin-orbit coupling constant of 303 cm^{-1} as measured in Eu_{2}CuO_{4}.[26] The magnetic moment per formula unit (f.u.) is plotted in units of the Bohr magneton, \mu_{B}, and we find that it increases rapidly at relatively low applied magnetic field where the saturation

Figure 2: (a) Plot of the resistivity against temperature for Ru_{1-y}(Nb,Sn)_{y}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta} with y = 0 (lower solid), y = 0.1 for Sn (upper solid), y = 0.1 for Nb (dash-dot), y = 0.2 for Sn (dashed), and y = 0.2 for Nb (dotted). The same datasets are re-plotted on the log-log scale in the inset. (b,c) M/H against temperature of Ru_{1-y}(Nb,Sn)_{y}Sr_{2}EuCeCu_{2}O_{10+\delta}.

  field is \sim0.2 T. Similar to previous studies, we find that the remanent magnetization (0.42_m__g_/f.u.) and 6 T magnetization (1.14_m__g_/f.u.) from the pure compound are large and there is no evidence for a spin-flop transition. These features are the typical characteristics of ferromagnetically or ferrimagnetically ordered materials.

It is apparent in Fig. 4 that the introduction of substituents into the ruthenium layers decreases the high-field moment per Ru site. The high-field moment per Ru site at 6 T is 1.14_m__g_/f.u. for RuSr2EuCeCu2O10-_d_. If RuSr2EuCeCu2O10-_d_ is ferromagnetic and Ru52+ is in the high-spin state (_S_ = 3/2), then the saturation moment is expected to be 3_m__g_, as calculated from M_{s} = _gS_, where g is the Lande g factor, which is taken as 2.00, and S is the total spin. If Ru54 is in the low-spin state (_S_ = 1/2), then the saturation moment is expected to be 1_m__B_. The moment obtained at 6 T is close to the saturation moment of Ru5+ in low-spin state, which suggests ferromagnetic order and a low-spin electronic configuration. However, we show later that this possibility is inconsistent with the high-temperature effective moment in the Curie-Weiss regime, and ferrimagnetic order is possible.

The high-field magnetization is linear in H and we use a linear extrapolation of the high-field magnetization to estimate the saturation magnetization, M_{s}. For the pure compound M_{s} = 1.07_m__g_/f.u., which is slightly smaller than the value at 6 T. M_{s} is plotted against the Sn or Nb fraction in the right lower inset to Fig. 4. We find that the rate of suppression is more rapid for Sn substituted samples. The rate of suppression for Sn substitution appears to be too large to be accounted for within a randomly site diluted nearest-neighbor 2D Heisenberg model.24 However, the Monte Carlo simulations were done for S = 1/2 and we show later that the magnetic order may be ferrimagnetic with a mixture of S = 1/2 and 3/2. This may affect the rate at which M_{s} is suppressed. A complete analysis can only be done when neutron-diffraction data are available and when Monte Carlo simulations are made that take into account the possible ferrimagnetic order.

While _T__M__s_ and M_{s} are more rapidly suppressed by Sn substitution, we find a linear correlation between M_{s} and _T__M__s_ for Sn and Nb that can be seen in Fig. 5. The linear correlation is evident by the solid line, which is a linear fit to the data. Thus, while Sn suppresses _T__M__s_ faster than Nb, we find a common M_{s}(_T__M__s_) for the Sn and Nb concentrations studied. A linear correlation is found in RuSr2EuCu2O8, where Sn is partially substituted for Ru and where M_{s} is measured at 6 T.16

Footnote 16: The _M_s_ values of _M_s are 0.15, 0.15, and 0.15, respectively.

Additional information about the magnetic state can be obtained from the effective moment in the Curie-Weiss temperature regime where _M_/_H_ is independent of _H_(>175 K). Typical data are plotted in Fig. 6 for the pure compound (open circles). The data can be understood by noting that _M_/_H_ can be written as

Figure 6: Plot of raw _M_/_H_ data against temperature up to 400 K for RuSr2EuCeCu2O10−_δ_ (open circles). The solid line is the fit to the data using Eq. (1) and the dashed line is the Van Vleck paramagnetic contribution of Eu3+ as described in the text.

  \[\frac{M}{H}=\frac{C}{T-\vartheta}+\chi_{\rm VV}(T)+\chi_{0}.\] (1)

The first term in Eq. (1) is the Curie-Weiss term from the Ru moments, where \vartheta is the Curie-Weiss temperature and the Curie constant is

\[C=\frac{N}{V}\frac{\mu_{0}P_{\rm eff}^{2}\mu_{B}^{2}(1-y)}{3k_{B}},\] (2)

where \mu_{0} is the vacuum permeability, P_{\rm eff} is the effective moment per Ru in units of \mu_{B}, k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, (1-y) is the number of Ru atoms per f.u., and N/V is the number of Ru atoms per unit volume in the pure compound. The second term in Eq. (1) is the Van Vleck susceptibility from Eu3+(^{2}F_{0}). The Van Vleck susceptibility from Eu3+ is plotted in Fig. 6 (dashed curve). The third term accounts for the susceptibility from the CuO2 planes and any temperature-independent susceptibility from the RuO2 planes. The spin susceptibility from the CuO2 planes in the HTSCs is small (<0.4\times10^{-4}, Ref. [27]) and hence we approximate it as a constant for temperatures above 175 K.

It can be seen in Fig. 6 that Eq. (1) provides a good fit to the data (solid curve). After fitting the data for the Sn-substituted samples, we find that \vartheta is 138, 127, and 95 K for y=0, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. The measured P_{\rm eff} are plotted in Fig. 7 for the Sn-substituted (filled circles) samples. Thus, we find that the Curie-Weiss temperature decreases while P_{\rm eff} remains nearly the same for increasing Sn concentration. The value we obtained for the pure 1.0Ce sample is 3.10\pm0.15/Ru. This value is close to that obtained by Butera _et al._ (cross, 3.07/Ru).[28] However, it is significantly greater than the value obtained by Felner _et al._ (open triangle, 2.13/Ru).[29] None of these P_{\rm eff} values corresponds to any of the theoretical values calculated from various high- and low-spin states of Ru4+ and Ru5+ (dashed lines).

The value of P_{\rm eff}=3.10\pm0.15/Ru for the pure 1.0Ce suggests the existence of a mixed valence. This has already been observed in RuSr2RCu2O8, where \sim40-50 % Ru4+ and \sim60-50 % Ru5+ has been deduced from magnetization,[30] nuclear magnetic resonance,[31, 32] and x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) (Ref. [33]) data. However, a mixed Ru4+ and Ru5+ valence is unlikely in RuSr2EuCeCu2O10+-\delta because the predicated valence is inconsistent with the Ru valence near 5+ that was measured by XANES.[18] The Ru valence required to account for the measured effective moment can be estimated from

\[P_{\rm eff}^{\rm tot}=\sqrt{f_{4+}(P_{\rm eff}^{\rm eff})^{2}+f_{5+}(P_{\rm eff }^{\rm 5+})^{2}},\] (3)

where f_{4+},f_{5+} are the fractions of Ru4+ and Ru5+, respectively, and P_{\rm eff}^{\rm 4+} and P_{\rm eff}^{\rm 5+} are the effective moments for Ru4+ and Ru5+, which can be obtained from P_{\rm eff}^{\rm e}=g\sqrt{S_{\rm e}(S_{\rm e}+1)}. Taking S_{4+}=1, S_{5+}=3/2, and P_{\rm eff}^{\rm tot}=3.1/Ru, it can be calculated that 77% of Ru4+ and 23% of Ru5+ are required, which makes the effective valence of +4.23. However, the valence of +4.23 is inconsistent with the \sim +5 valence obtained using other experimental methods.[17, 18]

It has been suggested by Felner _et al.[29]_ that Ru5+ is in a low-spin configuration with S_{\rm LS}=1/2, however it can be seen in Fig. 7 that 100% of Ru5+ in the low-spin configuration cannot account for the measured effective moment. Therefore, we propose a mixture of Ru5+ in the low-spin configuration with S_{\rm LS}=1/2 and the high-spin configuration with S_{\rm HS}=3/2. According to Hund's rule, the stable electronic configuration of Ru5+ for a perfect octahedral crystal field would have three valence electrons occupying the lower three t_{2g} orbitals, which leads to the high-spin state with S_{\rm HS}=3/2. However, octahedral distortion can lead to a splitting of the lower t_{2g} orbitals into one higher-energy and two lower-energy orbitals. This is observed in some other transition-metal oxides, including the HTSCs.[34] Thus, the low-spin configuration could arise from regions with distorted octahedra where only the two lower t_{2g} levels are occupied and leading to the low-spin S_{\rm LS}=1/2 suggestion of Felner _et al.[29]_ By repeating the calculation above, we obtain f_{\rm HS}\sim 55% and f_{\rm LS}\sim 45% for the fractions of Ru5+ in its high-spin state and low-spin state, respectively, for the pure compound.

To maintain overall charge neutrality, the partial substitution of Sn4+ for Ru5+ needs to be compensated for by an increase in the Ru valence, a decrease in the Cu valence, or a reduction in the oxygen content. If the main change is a reduction in the oxygen content and a small change in the Cu valence, then it is possible that the Ru valence remains at 5+ at least for up to 0.2 Sn. In this scenario, the fraction of Ru atoms in the low-spin and high-spin configurations might not be expected to change with increasing Sn concentration.

Figure 7: Plot of the effective Bohr magneton number P_{\rm eff} for Ru1,,ySn,Sr,Fe2EuCeCu2O10+-\delta with different Sn fractions (filled circles). The cross is the data of Butera _et al._ (Ref. [28]) and the open triangle is the data of Felner _et al._ (Ref. [29]), both for RuSr2EuCeCu2O10+-\delta (i.e., y=0). The theoretical values of P_{\rm eff} with different S are shown as the dashed lines in the figure and the solid line assumes a fixed Ru5+ low-spin (45%) and high-spin (55%) configuration.

  This is consistent with the data, as can be seen in Fig. 7 (solid line).

A mixture of Ru5+ high-spin and low-spin configurations as well as ferrimagnetic order can also account for the saturation magnetization at low temperatures. Taking the f1NS and f1S values estimated from the Curie-Weiss temperature regime and assuming that the low-spin and high-spin moments are antiparallel results in a saturation moment of ~1.2_m__B_/f.u., which is close to the measured value of 1.07_m__B_/f.u. When the experimental uncertainty in the measured _P_eff is accounted for, we obtain an expected saturation moment of 1.16 +- 0.24_m__B_/f.u.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have probed the superconducting and magnetic order in RuSr2Eu2-Ce2Cu2O10+-d by the partial substitution of Ru5+ by Nb5+ and Sn4+, which are isoelectronic and hole dopants, respectively. For superconducting and magnetically ordered RuSr2Eu1.2Ce0.8Cu2O10+-d we found a rapid suppression of the ferromagnetic component when Sn is partially substituted for Ru. In addition, we observed a decrease in _T__c_-_T_Meissner when the ferromagnetic component disappeared, which provides support for the spontaneous vortex phase model that is believed to account for the coexistence of magnetic and superconducting order.

The magnetic order was probed in nonsuperconducting RuSr2EuCeCu2O10+-d. We found that T_{M}^{\ast} and M_{s} are suppressed by Sn4+ and Nb5+ but the suppression is more rapid for Sn4+. Even though T_{M}^{\ast} and M_{s} are suppressed at different rates by Sn4+ and Nb5+, we find that M_{s} is a linear function of T_{M}^{\ast} and the Sn4+ and Nb5+ data fall on a common curve. We have shown that the high-temperature effective moment can be accounted for by a mixture of high-spin and low-spin Ru5+ electronic configurations and this model is also consistent with the nearly Sn concentration independent change in the effective moment. It is also possible within this model to account for the low-temperature saturation moment in terms of ferrimagnetic order.
