###### Abstract

Resistivity \rho(T), Hall coefficient R_{\rm H}(T), superconducting temperature T_{c}, and the slope of the upper critical field -dH_{c2}/dT were studied in poly- and single-crystalline samples of the Fe-based superconductor Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} irradiated by fast neutrons. Atomic disordering induced by the neutron irradiation leads to a fast suppression of T_{c} similarly to the case of doping of Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} with magnetic (Dy) and nonmagnetic (Sc, Y) impurities. The same effect was observed in a novel FeAs-based superconductor La(O-F)FeAs after irradiation. Such behavior is accounted for by strong pair breaking that is traceable to scattering at nonmagnetic impurities or radiation defects in these unconventional superconductors. In such superconductors, the sign of the order parameter changes between the different Fermi sheets (s^{\pm} model). Some relations that are specified for the properties of the normal and superconducting states in high-temperature superconductors are also observed in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}. The first is the relationship -dH_{c2}/dT\sim T_{c}, which allows us to assign the compound Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} to type II superconductors in the clean limit. The second is a correlation between the low-temperature linear coefficient a in the resistivity \rho=\rho_{0}+a_{1}T, which appears presumably due to the scattering at magnetic fluctuations, and T_{c}, this correlation being an evidence of a tight relation between the superconductivity and magnetism. Data point to an unconventional (nonphononic) mechanism of superconductivity in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} and probably in some other Fe-based compounds, which can be fruitfully studied via the radiation-induced disordering.

## I Introduction

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in layered iron-based compounds [1] has stimulated active experimental and theoretical studies of these systems in view of the possibility of the Cooper pairing of charge carriers of anomalous type. Hence, a systematic study of the disordering effects in new superconductors is especially important. [2] According to the Anderson theorem, [3] nonmagnetic impurities do not cause a suppression of the superconductivity in the case of a conventional _s_-type isotropic pairing. If the singlet pairing is traceable to the exchange of spin excitations, the requirement for this is the symmetry with a sign-changing order parameter. [4] Evidently, such requirement is fulfilled in high-T_{c} cuprates, where pairing with the _d_-wave symmetry is realized, while the pairing process is broken by the intraband scattering at nonmagnetic centers. [4, 5, 6] In the FeAs-based superconductors, the ordering parameter has the _s_-type symmetry. Therefore, a generally accepted model is the _s^{\pm}_ model, which treats a superconducting state with the opposite signs of the ordering parameter for electrons and holes. [7, 8, 4] In this case, nonmagnetic scatters must lead to the suppression of superconductivity due to the interband scattering between the electron- and hole-type Fermi surfaces. [4, 5, 9] Thus, the study of the atomic disordering in superconducting systems in which nonmagnetic scatters are generated allows one to reveal the symmetry of the ordering parameter.

Fast-neutron irradiation is the most effective method of atomic disordering, which was successfully applied earlier in investigation of a number of high-temperature superconductors. In the superconductors with strong electron-phonon interaction of the A-15 type, a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting transition T_{c}, as in Nb_{3}Sn or Y_{3}Si (or increase in the T_{c}, as in Mo_{3}Si or Mo_{3}Ge), upon irradiation takes place because of decrease (increase) in density of states N(E_{\rm F}). [10] In the two-gap superconductor MgB_{2}, irradiation results in a relatively weak decrease of T_{c}, [10, 11, 12] which is largely due to the averaging of the gaps caused by the interband scattering at nonmagnetic impurities. [9] In the above examples, T_{c} remains finite upon radiation atomic disordering; the origin of such behavior is the electron-phonon nature of superconductivity in these compounds. Except for particular cases when disordering leads to localization of the charge carriers (the density of states of mobile carriers is equal to zero), in the majority of metallic systems N(E_{\rm F}), the width of superconducting gap remain finite upon atomic disordering and, consequently, T_{c} does not vanish.

In the Cu-based superconductors, such as YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{3}, [10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] as well as the FeAs-based superconductors, [18, 19, 20] the fast and complete suppression of superconductivity under the high-energy particle irradiation, characteristic of the d pairing, most likely evidences a more exotic (nonphononic) pairing mechanism.

In the early '80s, several investigations were carried out to understand the superconductivity exhibited by compounds belonging to the R_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} system. [21, 22, 23, 24] These compounds crystallize in a tetragonal structure of the Sc_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} type, consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional iron chain along the c axis and quasi-two-dimensional iron squares parallel to the basal plane. In Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}, the superconductivity occurs at T_{c}\sim 6.0 K, which is exceptionally high among the Fe-based compounds other than the FeAs family. Moreover, a remarkable decrease of T_{c} by nonmagnetic impurities [25, 26, 27] also testifies to an unconventional origin of the superconductivity in these compounds.

This paper reports the results of studying the radiation-induced disordering effects on the properties of the superconducting and normal states of Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}. It was expected that the irradiation defects, as well as impurities, such as Sc and Y, would create nonmagnetic scattering centers without substantial changes of the band structure. However,  substitution of Lu with atoms of the same valences cannot produce a significant disorder (disorder appears in this case as a result of some lattice distortions in the vicinity of substituted sites), while the fast-neutron irradiation allows one to create defects with a much higher scattering ability and, hence, a stronger disorder can be gained. Studies of the states with a strong atomic disordering are of a paramount importance, since, judging from the observed (\sim50%) decrease of T_{c} in experiments on doping, it is impossible to establish whether the superconductivity is fully suppressed, as in Cu- or Fe-based superconductors, or the T_{c} value remains finite, as in Nb_{3}Sn or MgB_{2}.

In the present study, our attention is focused on the effect of disordering on T_{c} and the slope of the upper critical field -dH_{c2}/dT, as well as their correlations with the normal-state properties, the disordering-induced changes in the crystal structure being beyond the scope of the work.

## II Experimental details and results

Samples of Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} were prepared by arc melting stoichiometric amounts of high-purity elements. To improve the homogeneity of polycrystalline samples, they were annealed at 1200 degC for 19 hours. Single crystals 1.3 \times 0.15 \times 0.15 mm in size were obtained by annealing of the arc-melted ingot at 1720 degC for 2 hours.

The resistivity \rho and Hall coefficient R_{\rm{H}} were measured using the standard four-point method with the reverse of the directions of the DC current and magnetic field and switching over between the current and potential leads.[28] The electric contacts were made by ultrasonic soldering with indium. Measurements were performed in the temperature range T = 1.5-380 K in magnetic fields up to 13.6 T. The polycrystalline samples were irradiated with fast neutrons with the fluence \Phi = 2 \times 10^{19} cm^{-2} (for neutron energies E_{\rm{n}}> 0.1 MeV) at the irradiation temperature T_{\rm{irr}} = 50 \pm 10 degC. The single-crystal samples were irradiated with the lower fluence \Phi = 5 \times 10^{18} cm^{-2}. The samples of both types were annealed isochorally for 0.5 h in vacuum in the temperature range of T_{\rm{am}} = 50-1000 degC with a 50 degC step.

The irradiation to the fast-neutron fluence \Phi = 2 \times 10^{19} cm^{-2} (polycrystalline samples) and \Phi = 5 \times 10^{18} cm^{-2} (single crystals) suppresses the superconductivity and results in significant changes in the resistivity curves \rho(_T_). Sequential annealings in the range of T_{\rm{am}} = 100-1000 degC lead to a practically complete restoration of the sample properties in both the normal and superconducting states.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the temperature dependences of the resisitivity \rho(_T_) for the polycrystalline and single crystal samples, respectively, representing pristine, irradiated, and annealed states. Both sets of data are very similar, taking into account the anisotropy of resistivity \rho_{\rm{e}}b/\rho_{c}\sim 4,[27] whereas the percolation model[29] predicts that the ratio of the polycrystalline sample resistivity \rho to the single-crystal resistivity \rho_{\rm{c}} must be \rho/\rho_{\rm{c}}\sim 2.7.

(b) Temperature dependences of the resisitivity in the c direction \rho_{c} for the pristine, irradiated to the neutron fluence \Phi = 5 \times 10^{18} cm^{-2}, and annealed Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} single crystals. Keys to curves: pristine sample (Pris), irradiated sample (Irr), digits denote annealing temperature in °C.

  The slope d\rho/dT at high temperatures T = 100-380 K decreases with increasing \rho_{0}. A similar saturation of the resistivity is observed in many strongly disordered metallic compounds, including many compounds irradiated by fast neutrons.[10]

In the temperature range 10 <T< 70 K, the \rho(T) curves for the single-crystal sample at low \rho_{0} = 5-40 \mu\Omega cm obey a quadratic law \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+a_{2}T^{2} with a_{2}\sim 4\cdot 10^{-3}\mu\Omega cm/K^{2} (Fig. 2). When fitting curves with a power function \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+a_{2}T^{k}, the index k varies within the limits from 2.02 to 2.12. Similar behavior is observed for the polycrystalline sample: a_{2} is approximately constant at \rho_{0} = 5-50 \mu\Omega cm and slightly decreases with the further increase in \rho_{0} (Fig. 1).

At lower temperatures T< 10 K, the resistivity curves are described better by linear functions \rho(T)=a_{0}+a_{1}T for the superconducting samples (\rho_{0}< 10 \mu\Omega cm, Fig. 3), while for the nonsuperconducting samples (\rho_{0}> 40 \mu\Omega cm), a small negative slope d\rho/dT< 0 is observed.

The Hall coefficient R_{\rm H} for the pristine polycrystalline sample is relatively small and slightly temperature dependent, which is in agreement with the measurements of R_{\rm H} on single crystals, as well as the data on the Fermi surfaces calculated for Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} by the full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method. The Fermi surface consists of two holelike bands and one electronlike band,[31] so that the hole and electronic contributions to the Hall coefficient are almost compensated. The irradiation does not lead to a considerable change in R_{\rm H} (Fig. 4), which serves as a kind of evidence that there are no essential doping effects due to the disordering induced by the fast-neutron irradiation.

Fig. 5 sums the results of annealing of the polycrystalline and single-crystal samples. The reduced resistivity \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}, which is a good measure of the electron mean-free path in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5},[27] shows a similar behavior in the single- and polycrystals as a function of the annealing temperature T_{\rm am}. The intensive recovery of \rho_{0}/\rho_{300} begins at T_{\rm am}\geqslant 600 ^{\circ}C only; the radiation defects still survive at relatively high annealing temperatures T_{\rm am}\sim 900 ^{\circ}C.

To compare the suppression of the superconductivity under irradiation with the results of doping with nonmagnetic impurities,[32, 33, 34] we have drawn T_{c} determined at 0.5 the normal-state resistivity as a function of the reduced resistivity \rho_{0}/\rho_{300} (Fig. 6), which does not depend on the sample quality (poly- or single crystal). With increasing \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}, the T_{c} value is seen to decrease similarly in both the irradiated and doped samples; it goes to zero at \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}\approx 0.3, which corresponds to \rho_{0}\approx 80 and \approx40 \mu\Omega cm for the polycrystalline and single-crystal samples, respectively. A common dependence of T_{c} on \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}, quite apparent at the starting portion \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}\leqslant 0.15, indicates that the only reason for the T_{c} decrease, both under irradiation and doping, is the appearance of scattering centers.

The dashed and dotted horizontal lines show the levels of \rho_{0}/\rho_{100} and T_{c} for the pristine polycrystalline and single-crystal samples, respectively.

[27]); straight line is drawn by eye. Inset shows t=T_{c}/T_{c0} vs g=\hbar/(2\pi k_{B}T_{c0}\tau) for the polycrystalline (○) and single-crystal (□) Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5} samples and irradiated La(O-F)FeAs sample (•) (Ref. [18]).

  Figure 7 shows the slope of the upper critical field -dH_{c2}/dT determined at 0.9 the normal-state resistivity as a function of T_{c} for the irradiated and annealed Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} polycrystalline and single-crystal samples. The relationship (-dH_{c2}/dT)_{c}\approx 2(-dH_{c2}/dT)_{ab} holds well for all superconducting crystals, which evidences that the topology of the Fermi surface is not significantly changed by irradiation.

The observed behavior can be roughly approximated by a linear dependence. The similar behavior features many FeAs-based compounds.[39] It is worth mentioning that -dH_{c2}/dT\simT_{c} is predicted for type II superconductors in the clean limit, while in the dirty limit, the opposite dependence -dH_{c2}/dT\sim\rho_{0} (that is, the -dH_{c2}/dT growth upon decreasing T_{c}) takes place.

The estimation of g=t\xi_{0}/l has shown (Fig. 6) that the superconducting samples belong to the clean (\xi_{0}\ll l) or the intermediate (\xi_{0}\approx l) limit for the samples with T_{c}\approx 5 K or T_{c}\approx 1.5 K, respectively. In the expression for the slope of the upper critical field -dH_{c2}/dT=\phi_{0}/(0.69\times 2\pi\xi^{2}T_{c}), the coherent length \xi can be written in the intermediate limit as

\[1/\xi^{2}\approx(1/\xi_{0})(1/\xi_{0}+1/l),\] (3)

and, hence, dH_{c2}/dT depends on T_{c} and \rho_{0} as

\[-\text{d}H_{c2}\text{/d}T\approx\text{c}_{1}T_{c}\rho_{0}.\] (4)

Figure 8 shows such dependence in the coordinates (-dH_{c2}/dT)/T_{c} as a function of \rho_{0}/T_{c}. In the limit \rho_{0}/T_{c}\to 0, the intercept gives the coherent length \xi=\xi_{0} in the clean limit (\xi_{0}\approx 100 A, \xi_{0ab}\approx 50 A). According to Eqs. (3) and (4), at the doubled intersect, we get \xi_{0}=l (vertical line in Fig. 8).

According to Fig. 8, the ration \xi_{0}/l=g/t=1 in the single-crystal sample corresponds to \rho_{0}\sim 30\mu\Omega cm, T_{c}\sim 1.5 K. This is in a qualitative agreement with the estimation of g according to Eq. (2); g=t (Fig. 6) corresponds to \rho_{0}\sim 15\mu\Omega cm, T_{c}\sim 4 K.

Thus, our estimations of the relation between \xi_{0} and l clearly show that the pristine Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} samples with T_{c}\approx 5 K are ascribed to the clean limit \xi_{0}\ll l. On the other hand, these estimations are in a visual disagreement with the relation between the anisotropy of resistivities \rho_{ab}/\rho_{c} and slopes of the upper critical field (dH_{c2}/dT_{c}/dH_{c2}/dT_{ab}=\xi_{c}/\xi_{ab}. In the clean limit, \xi_{ab,c}\approx(\xi_{0})_{ab,c}, and, hence, the anisotropy of the upper critical field is proportional to \rho_{ab}/\rho_{c}, while in the dirty limit, \xi_{ab,c}\approx[(\xi_{0})_{ab,c}]^{1/2}, and the anisotropy of the upper critical field is proportional to (\rho_{ab}/\rho_{c})^{1/2}. As it was mentioned above, the anisotropy of the upper critical field for the single crystal in the pristine, irradiated, and annealed states is close to two. The anisotropy of the resistivities (in the pristine sample) \rho_{ab}/\rho_{c} is approximately equal to four,[27] which means that the state is closer to the dirty limit. On the other hand, estimations of l, using the values of \rho_{0} and low-temperature Hall coefficient R_{\text{H}} reported in Ref. [27], yield for the pristine sample \xi_{ab}\sim 50 A and l_{ab}\sim 200 A, which allows the sample state to be referred to the clean limit; however, such estimations for many-band systems are invalid. Another way of estimating l is to employ the data for the strongly disordered sample in which \rho weakly depends on temperature \rho\sim\rho_{\text{sat}}. Assuming that in

  this region l has a value of the order of atomic spacing d\sim 5 A, one can independently estimate l based on the relationship \rho_{0c}\sim\rho_{\rm sat}(d/l). Specifying for the single-crystal sample \rho_{\rm sat}\sim 250\mu\Omega cm, we obtain for the pristine sample the value \rho_{0c}\sim 5\mu\Omega cm and l_{c}\sim 250 A, which again are assigned to the clean limit. Obviously, to resolve the contradiction, direct measurements are necessary, which were impossible to perform in our crystals because of a too large (\sim10) ratio of the sample dimensions in the directions c and a.

Similar estimations can be made for the parameter g=t\xi_{0c}/l_{c}. They show that the superconductivity disappears at g\sim 2 in agreement with the estimates of g by Eq. (2) (inset in Fig. 6). However, this estimate, just as the previous ones, is rather rough and unsuitable for such many-band systems as Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}. Yet, with allowance for all possible uncertainties in the estimation of g, the AG model predicts a markedly faster degradation of superconductivity than is observed in experiments.

Returning to the correlation between the linear term in resistivity a_{1} and T_{c} (inset in Fig. 3), it is worth mentioning that the relation T_{c}\sim a_{1} is an attribute of many unconventional superconductors. The T_{c}-vs-a_{1} correlation is very close to that observed for the Fe- and Cu-based high-T_{c} superconductors. This correlation does not seem evident in our case of the irradiated Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} sample, since the a_{1} term in the low-T resistivity is significantly masked by the logarithmic term for the samples with T_{c}\lesssim 3 K. On the other hand, at T>10 K, the quadratic term dominates, since the linear term for Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} is much less than that for high-T_{c} superconductors, which is due to the low value of T_{c}\sim 6 K in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} in comparison with T_{c}\sim 100 K in high-T_{c} superconductors. When fitting the curves with the power function \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+a_{1}T^{k}, the index k varies in the range 1.0-1.4, which noticeably differs from that for the quadratic dependence (Fig. 3). In any case, the presence of a quasilinear term in the low-temperature electrical conductivity is beyond question.

The linear-in-T resistivity can be explained by the existence of two-dimensional AF spin fluctuations in the theory of nearly AF metals.[40; 41] The AF fluctuations are enhanced significantly near the AF phase in optimally doped high-T_{c} superconductors, where the temperature dependence of the resistivity changes from the T^{2} to T law. In Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}, with the lower T_{c}, the linear term is meaningful only at low T<10 K (Fig. 3), while at higher 10<T<70 K, the T^{2} term predominates (Fig. 2).

## III Conclusions

In conclusion, our results show the fast decrease of the superconducting temperature T_{c} in the Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} samples under fast-neutron irradiation. The uniform dependence of T_{c} on the residual resistivity \rho_{0} for the case of both irradiation and doping evidences that the decrease in T_{c} is due to the presence of nonmagnetic scattering centers. The slow changes in the Hall coefficient R_{\rm H} and ({\rm d}H_{c2}/{\rm d}T)_{c}/({\rm d}H_{c2}/{\rm d}T)_{ab} show that there are no substantial changes in the topology of the Fermi surface caused by irradiation.

The superconductivity disappears when the coherent length \xi_{0} becomes larger than the mean-free path l, g=t\xi_{0}/l>1. Such behavior is very similar to that observed in FeAs-based superconductors, but the T_{c} decrease is \sim5 times as slow as that predicted based on the Abrikosov-Gor'kov equation, which describes the superconductivity suppression by nonmagnetic impurities (defects) for the case of d and s^{\pm} pairing.

Our estimations show that the observed correlation of T_{c} with the slope of the upper critical field -{\rm d}H_{c2}/{\rm d}T in the irradiated polycrystalline and single-crystal Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} samples (and probably in other Fe-based superconductors) has a trivial origin: by their state, the superconducting samples belong to the clean \xi_{0}\ll l (at worst, to the intermediate \xi_{0}\approx l) limit.

The observed correlation of the liner term a_{1} in the resistivity \rho(T)=a_{0}+a_{1}T with T_{c} testify to the significance of spin fluctuations in the formation of the superconducting state in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}.

###### Abstract

Resistivity \rho(T), Hall coefficient R_{\rm H}(T), superconducting temperature T_{c}, and the slope of the upper critical field -dH_{c2}/dT were studied in poly- and single-crystalline samples of the Fe-based superconductor Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} irradiated by fast neutrons. Atomic disordering induced by the neutron irradiation leads to a fast suppression of T_{c} similarly to the case of doping of Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} with magnetic (Dy) and nonmagnetic (Sc, Y) impurities. The same effect was observed in a novel FeAs-based superconductor La(O-F)FeAs after irradiation. Such behavior is accounted for by strong pair breaking that is traceable to scattering at nonmagnetic impurities or radiation defects in these unconventional superconductors. In such superconductors, the sign of the order parameter changes between the different Fermi sheets (s^{\pm} model). Some relations that are specified for the properties of the normal and superconducting states in high-temperature superconductors are also observed in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}. The first is the relationship -dH_{c2}/dT\sim T_{c}, which allows us to assign the compound Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} to type II superconductors in the clean limit. The second is a correlation between the low-temperature linear coefficient a in the resistivity \rho=\rho_{0}+a_{1}T, which appears presumably due to the scattering at magnetic fluctuations, and T_{c}, this correlation being an evidence of a tight relation between the superconductivity and magnetism. Data point to an unconventional (nonphononic) mechanism of superconductivity in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} and probably in some other Fe-based compounds, which can be fruitfully studied via the radiation-induced disordering.

## I Introduction

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in layered iron-based compounds [1] has stimulated active experimental and theoretical studies of these systems in view of the possibility of the Cooper pairing of charge carriers of anomalous type. Hence, a systematic study of the disordering effects in new superconductors is especially important. [2] According to the Anderson theorem, [3] nonmagnetic impurities do not cause a suppression of the superconductivity in the case of a conventional _s_-type isotropic pairing. If the singlet pairing is traceable to the exchange of spin excitations, the requirement for this is the symmetry with a sign-changing order parameter. [4] Evidently, such requirement is fulfilled in high-T_{c} cuprates, where pairing with the _d_-wave symmetry is realized, while the pairing process is broken by the intraband scattering at nonmagnetic centers. [4, 5, 6] In the FeAs-based superconductors, the ordering parameter has the _s_-type symmetry. Therefore, a generally accepted model is the _s^{\pm}_ model, which treats a superconducting state with the opposite signs of the ordering parameter for electrons and holes. [7, 8, 4] In this case, nonmagnetic scatters must lead to the suppression of superconductivity due to the interband scattering between the electron- and hole-type Fermi surfaces. [4, 5, 9] Thus, the study of the atomic disordering in superconducting systems in which nonmagnetic scatters are generated allows one to reveal the symmetry of the ordering parameter.

Fast-neutron irradiation is the most effective method of atomic disordering, which was successfully applied earlier in investigation of a number of high-temperature superconductors. In the superconductors with strong electron-phonon interaction of the A-15 type, a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting transition T_{c}, as in Nb_{3}Sn or Y_{3}Si (or increase in the T_{c}, as in Mo_{3}Si or Mo_{3}Ge), upon irradiation takes place because of decrease (increase) in density of states N(E_{\rm F}). [10] In the two-gap superconductor MgB_{2}, irradiation results in a relatively weak decrease of T_{c}, [10, 11, 12] which is largely due to the averaging of the gaps caused by the interband scattering at nonmagnetic impurities. [9] In the above examples, T_{c} remains finite upon radiation atomic disordering; the origin of such behavior is the electron-phonon nature of superconductivity in these compounds. Except for particular cases when disordering leads to localization of the charge carriers (the density of states of mobile carriers is equal to zero), in the majority of metallic systems N(E_{\rm F}), the width of superconducting gap remain finite upon atomic disordering and, consequently, T_{c} does not vanish.

In the Cu-based superconductors, such as YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{3}, [10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] as well as the FeAs-based superconductors, [18, 19, 20] the fast and complete suppression of superconductivity under the high-energy particle irradiation, characteristic of the d pairing, most likely evidences a more exotic (nonphononic) pairing mechanism.

In the early '80s, several investigations were carried out to understand the superconductivity exhibited by compounds belonging to the R_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} system. [21, 22, 23, 24] These compounds crystallize in a tetragonal structure of the Sc_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} type, consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional iron chain along the c axis and quasi-two-dimensional iron squares parallel to the basal plane. In Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}, the superconductivity occurs at T_{c}\sim 6.0 K, which is exceptionally high among the Fe-based compounds other than the FeAs family. Moreover, a remarkable decrease of T_{c} by nonmagnetic impurities [25, 26, 27] also testifies to an unconventional origin of the superconductivity in these compounds.

This paper reports the results of studying the radiation-induced disordering effects on the properties of the superconducting and normal states of Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}. It was expected that the irradiation defects, as well as impurities, such as Sc and Y, would create nonmagnetic scattering centers without substantial changes of the band structure. However,  substitution of Lu with atoms of the same valences cannot produce a significant disorder (disorder appears in this case as a result of some lattice distortions in the vicinity of substituted sites), while the fast-neutron irradiation allows one to create defects with a much higher scattering ability and, hence, a stronger disorder can be gained. Studies of the states with a strong atomic disordering are of a paramount importance, since, judging from the observed (\sim50%) decrease of T_{c} in experiments on doping, it is impossible to establish whether the superconductivity is fully suppressed, as in Cu- or Fe-based superconductors, or the T_{c} value remains finite, as in Nb_{3}Sn or MgB_{2}.

In the present study, our attention is focused on the effect of disordering on T_{c} and the slope of the upper critical field -dH_{c2}/dT, as well as their correlations with the normal-state properties, the disordering-induced changes in the crystal structure being beyond the scope of the work.

## II Experimental details and results

Samples of Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} were prepared by arc melting stoichiometric amounts of high-purity elements. To improve the homogeneity of polycrystalline samples, they were annealed at 1200 degC for 19 hours. Single crystals 1.3 \times 0.15 \times 0.15 mm in size were obtained by annealing of the arc-melted ingot at 1720 degC for 2 hours.

The resistivity \rho and Hall coefficient R_{\rm{H}} were measured using the standard four-point method with the reverse of the directions of the DC current and magnetic field and switching over between the current and potential leads.[28] The electric contacts were made by ultrasonic soldering with indium. Measurements were performed in the temperature range T = 1.5-380 K in magnetic fields up to 13.6 T. The polycrystalline samples were irradiated with fast neutrons with the fluence \Phi = 2 \times 10^{19} cm^{-2} (for neutron energies E_{\rm{n}}> 0.1 MeV) at the irradiation temperature T_{\rm{irr}} = 50 \pm 10 degC. The single-crystal samples were irradiated with the lower fluence \Phi = 5 \times 10^{18} cm^{-2}. The samples of both types were annealed isochorally for 0.5 h in vacuum in the temperature range of T_{\rm{am}} = 50-1000 degC with a 50 degC step.

The irradiation to the fast-neutron fluence \Phi = 2 \times 10^{19} cm^{-2} (polycrystalline samples) and \Phi = 5 \times 10^{18} cm^{-2} (single crystals) suppresses the superconductivity and results in significant changes in the resistivity curves \rho(_T_). Sequential annealings in the range of T_{\rm{am}} = 100-1000 degC lead to a practically complete restoration of the sample properties in both the normal and superconducting states.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the temperature dependences of the resisitivity \rho(_T_) for the polycrystalline and single crystal samples, respectively, representing pristine, irradiated, and annealed states. Both sets of data are very similar, taking into account the anisotropy of resistivity \rho_{\rm{e}}b/\rho_{c}\sim 4,[27] whereas the percolation model[29] predicts that the ratio of the polycrystalline sample resistivity \rho to the single-crystal resistivity \rho_{\rm{c}} must be \rho/\rho_{\rm{c}}\sim 2.7.

(b) Temperature dependences of the resisitivity in the c direction \rho_{c} for the pristine, irradiated to the neutron fluence \Phi = 5 \times 10^{18} cm^{-2}, and annealed Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} single crystals. Keys to curves: pristine sample (Pris), irradiated sample (Irr), digits denote annealing temperature in °C.

  The slope d\rho/dT at high temperatures T = 100-380 K decreases with increasing \rho_{0}. A similar saturation of the resistivity is observed in many strongly disordered metallic compounds, including many compounds irradiated by fast neutrons.[10]

In the temperature range 10 <T< 70 K, the \rho(T) curves for the single-crystal sample at low \rho_{0} = 5-40 \mu\Omega cm obey a quadratic law \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+a_{2}T^{2} with a_{2}\sim 4\cdot 10^{-3}\mu\Omega cm/K^{2} (Fig. 2). When fitting curves with a power function \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+a_{2}T^{k}, the index k varies within the limits from 2.02 to 2.12. Similar behavior is observed for the polycrystalline sample: a_{2} is approximately constant at \rho_{0} = 5-50 \mu\Omega cm and slightly decreases with the further increase in \rho_{0} (Fig. 1).

At lower temperatures T< 10 K, the resistivity curves are described better by linear functions \rho(T)=a_{0}+a_{1}T for the superconducting samples (\rho_{0}< 10 \mu\Omega cm, Fig. 3), while for the nonsuperconducting samples (\rho_{0}> 40 \mu\Omega cm), a small negative slope d\rho/dT< 0 is observed.

The Hall coefficient R_{\rm H} for the pristine polycrystalline sample is relatively small and slightly temperature dependent, which is in agreement with the measurements of R_{\rm H} on single crystals, as well as the data on the Fermi surfaces calculated for Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} by the full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method. The Fermi surface consists of two holelike bands and one electronlike band,[31] so that the hole and electronic contributions to the Hall coefficient are almost compensated. The irradiation does not lead to a considerable change in R_{\rm H} (Fig. 4), which serves as a kind of evidence that there are no essential doping effects due to the disordering induced by the fast-neutron irradiation.

Fig. 5 sums the results of annealing of the polycrystalline and single-crystal samples. The reduced resistivity \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}, which is a good measure of the electron mean-free path in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5},[27] shows a similar behavior in the single- and polycrystals as a function of the annealing temperature T_{\rm am}. The intensive recovery of \rho_{0}/\rho_{300} begins at T_{\rm am}\geqslant 600 ^{\circ}C only; the radiation defects still survive at relatively high annealing temperatures T_{\rm am}\sim 900 ^{\circ}C.

To compare the suppression of the superconductivity under irradiation with the results of doping with nonmagnetic impurities,[32, 33, 34] we have drawn T_{c} determined at 0.5 the normal-state resistivity as a function of the reduced resistivity \rho_{0}/\rho_{300} (Fig. 6), which does not depend on the sample quality (poly- or single crystal). With increasing \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}, the T_{c} value is seen to decrease similarly in both the irradiated and doped samples; it goes to zero at \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}\approx 0.3, which corresponds to \rho_{0}\approx 80 and \approx40 \mu\Omega cm for the polycrystalline and single-crystal samples, respectively. A common dependence of T_{c} on \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}, quite apparent at the starting portion \rho_{0}/\rho_{300}\leqslant 0.15, indicates that the only reason for the T_{c} decrease, both under irradiation and doping, is the appearance of scattering centers.

The dashed and dotted horizontal lines show the levels of \rho_{0}/\rho_{100} and T_{c} for the pristine polycrystalline and single-crystal samples, respectively.

[27]); straight line is drawn by eye. Inset shows t=T_{c}/T_{c0} vs g=\hbar/(2\pi k_{B}T_{c0}\tau) for the polycrystalline (○) and single-crystal (□) Lu_{2}Fe_{5}Si_{5} samples and irradiated La(O-F)FeAs sample (•) (Ref. [18]).

  Figure 7 shows the slope of the upper critical field -dH_{c2}/dT determined at 0.9 the normal-state resistivity as a function of T_{c} for the irradiated and annealed Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} polycrystalline and single-crystal samples. The relationship (-dH_{c2}/dT)_{c}\approx 2(-dH_{c2}/dT)_{ab} holds well for all superconducting crystals, which evidences that the topology of the Fermi surface is not significantly changed by irradiation.

The observed behavior can be roughly approximated by a linear dependence. The similar behavior features many FeAs-based compounds.[39] It is worth mentioning that -dH_{c2}/dT\simT_{c} is predicted for type II superconductors in the clean limit, while in the dirty limit, the opposite dependence -dH_{c2}/dT\sim\rho_{0} (that is, the -dH_{c2}/dT growth upon decreasing T_{c}) takes place.

The estimation of g=t\xi_{0}/l has shown (Fig. 6) that the superconducting samples belong to the clean (\xi_{0}\ll l) or the intermediate (\xi_{0}\approx l) limit for the samples with T_{c}\approx 5 K or T_{c}\approx 1.5 K, respectively. In the expression for the slope of the upper critical field -dH_{c2}/dT=\phi_{0}/(0.69\times 2\pi\xi^{2}T_{c}), the coherent length \xi can be written in the intermediate limit as

\[1/\xi^{2}\approx(1/\xi_{0})(1/\xi_{0}+1/l),\] (3)

and, hence, dH_{c2}/dT depends on T_{c} and \rho_{0} as

\[-\text{d}H_{c2}\text{/d}T\approx\text{c}_{1}T_{c}\rho_{0}.\] (4)

Figure 8 shows such dependence in the coordinates (-dH_{c2}/dT)/T_{c} as a function of \rho_{0}/T_{c}. In the limit \rho_{0}/T_{c}\to 0, the intercept gives the coherent length \xi=\xi_{0} in the clean limit (\xi_{0}\approx 100 A, \xi_{0ab}\approx 50 A). According to Eqs. (3) and (4), at the doubled intersect, we get \xi_{0}=l (vertical line in Fig. 8).

According to Fig. 8, the ration \xi_{0}/l=g/t=1 in the single-crystal sample corresponds to \rho_{0}\sim 30\mu\Omega cm, T_{c}\sim 1.5 K. This is in a qualitative agreement with the estimation of g according to Eq. (2); g=t (Fig. 6) corresponds to \rho_{0}\sim 15\mu\Omega cm, T_{c}\sim 4 K.

Thus, our estimations of the relation between \xi_{0} and l clearly show that the pristine Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} samples with T_{c}\approx 5 K are ascribed to the clean limit \xi_{0}\ll l. On the other hand, these estimations are in a visual disagreement with the relation between the anisotropy of resistivities \rho_{ab}/\rho_{c} and slopes of the upper critical field (dH_{c2}/dT_{c}/dH_{c2}/dT_{ab}=\xi_{c}/\xi_{ab}. In the clean limit, \xi_{ab,c}\approx(\xi_{0})_{ab,c}, and, hence, the anisotropy of the upper critical field is proportional to \rho_{ab}/\rho_{c}, while in the dirty limit, \xi_{ab,c}\approx[(\xi_{0})_{ab,c}]^{1/2}, and the anisotropy of the upper critical field is proportional to (\rho_{ab}/\rho_{c})^{1/2}. As it was mentioned above, the anisotropy of the upper critical field for the single crystal in the pristine, irradiated, and annealed states is close to two. The anisotropy of the resistivities (in the pristine sample) \rho_{ab}/\rho_{c} is approximately equal to four,[27] which means that the state is closer to the dirty limit. On the other hand, estimations of l, using the values of \rho_{0} and low-temperature Hall coefficient R_{\text{H}} reported in Ref. [27], yield for the pristine sample \xi_{ab}\sim 50 A and l_{ab}\sim 200 A, which allows the sample state to be referred to the clean limit; however, such estimations for many-band systems are invalid. Another way of estimating l is to employ the data for the strongly disordered sample in which \rho weakly depends on temperature \rho\sim\rho_{\text{sat}}. Assuming that in

  this region l has a value of the order of atomic spacing d\sim 5 A, one can independently estimate l based on the relationship \rho_{0c}\sim\rho_{\rm sat}(d/l). Specifying for the single-crystal sample \rho_{\rm sat}\sim 250\mu\Omega cm, we obtain for the pristine sample the value \rho_{0c}\sim 5\mu\Omega cm and l_{c}\sim 250 A, which again are assigned to the clean limit. Obviously, to resolve the contradiction, direct measurements are necessary, which were impossible to perform in our crystals because of a too large (\sim10) ratio of the sample dimensions in the directions c and a.

Similar estimations can be made for the parameter g=t\xi_{0c}/l_{c}. They show that the superconductivity disappears at g\sim 2 in agreement with the estimates of g by Eq. (2) (inset in Fig. 6). However, this estimate, just as the previous ones, is rather rough and unsuitable for such many-band systems as Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}. Yet, with allowance for all possible uncertainties in the estimation of g, the AG model predicts a markedly faster degradation of superconductivity than is observed in experiments.

Returning to the correlation between the linear term in resistivity a_{1} and T_{c} (inset in Fig. 3), it is worth mentioning that the relation T_{c}\sim a_{1} is an attribute of many unconventional superconductors. The T_{c}-vs-a_{1} correlation is very close to that observed for the Fe- and Cu-based high-T_{c} superconductors. This correlation does not seem evident in our case of the irradiated Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} sample, since the a_{1} term in the low-T resistivity is significantly masked by the logarithmic term for the samples with T_{c}\lesssim 3 K. On the other hand, at T>10 K, the quadratic term dominates, since the linear term for Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} is much less than that for high-T_{c} superconductors, which is due to the low value of T_{c}\sim 6 K in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} in comparison with T_{c}\sim 100 K in high-T_{c} superconductors. When fitting the curves with the power function \rho(T)=\rho_{0}+a_{1}T^{k}, the index k varies in the range 1.0-1.4, which noticeably differs from that for the quadratic dependence (Fig. 3). In any case, the presence of a quasilinear term in the low-temperature electrical conductivity is beyond question.

The linear-in-T resistivity can be explained by the existence of two-dimensional AF spin fluctuations in the theory of nearly AF metals.[40; 41] The AF fluctuations are enhanced significantly near the AF phase in optimally doped high-T_{c} superconductors, where the temperature dependence of the resistivity changes from the T^{2} to T law. In Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}, with the lower T_{c}, the linear term is meaningful only at low T<10 K (Fig. 3), while at higher 10<T<70 K, the T^{2} term predominates (Fig. 2).

## III Conclusions

In conclusion, our results show the fast decrease of the superconducting temperature T_{c} in the Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} samples under fast-neutron irradiation. The uniform dependence of T_{c} on the residual resistivity \rho_{0} for the case of both irradiation and doping evidences that the decrease in T_{c} is due to the presence of nonmagnetic scattering centers. The slow changes in the Hall coefficient R_{\rm H} and ({\rm d}H_{c2}/{\rm d}T)_{c}/({\rm d}H_{c2}/{\rm d}T)_{ab} show that there are no substantial changes in the topology of the Fermi surface caused by irradiation.

The superconductivity disappears when the coherent length \xi_{0} becomes larger than the mean-free path l, g=t\xi_{0}/l>1. Such behavior is very similar to that observed in FeAs-based superconductors, but the T_{c} decrease is \sim5 times as slow as that predicted based on the Abrikosov-Gor'kov equation, which describes the superconductivity suppression by nonmagnetic impurities (defects) for the case of d and s^{\pm} pairing.

Our estimations show that the observed correlation of T_{c} with the slope of the upper critical field -{\rm d}H_{c2}/{\rm d}T in the irradiated polycrystalline and single-crystal Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5} samples (and probably in other Fe-based superconductors) has a trivial origin: by their state, the superconducting samples belong to the clean \xi_{0}\ll l (at worst, to the intermediate \xi_{0}\approx l) limit.

The observed correlation of the liner term a_{1} in the resistivity \rho(T)=a_{0}+a_{1}T with T_{c} testify to the significance of spin fluctuations in the formation of the superconducting state in Lu_{2}Fe_{3}Si_{5}.
