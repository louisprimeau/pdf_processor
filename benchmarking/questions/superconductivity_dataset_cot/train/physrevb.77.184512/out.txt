###### Abstract

We report on measurements of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{ab} in the infinite-layer electron-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductor Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 by means of muon-spin rotation. The observed temperature and magnetic field dependences of \lambda_{ab} are consistent with the presence of a substantial s-wave component in the superconducting order parameter, in good agreement with the results of tunneling, specific heat, and small-angle neutron scattering experiments.

## I Introduction

The symmetry of the superconducting energy gap is one of the essential issues for understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. For hole-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductors (HTS's) it is commonly accepted that the superconducting energy gap has d-wave symmetry, as indicated, e.g., by tricrystal experiments, although overwhelming evidence is now accumulating for a multicomponent [(d+s)-wave] gap.[2, 3, 4] For electron-doped HTS's, however, no consensus has been reached on this issue so far. A number of experiments, including angular resolved photoemission,[5, 6] scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements,[7] Raman scattering,[8] and magnetic penetration depth studies,[9, 10] point to a d-wave, or, more generally, to a nonmonotonic d-wave gap (with the gap maximum between the nodal and antinodal points on the Fermi surface) in electron-doped Nd2-CeFeCuO4 and Pr2-CeFeCuO4. On the contrary, a state corresponding to an s-or a nonmonotonic s-wave gap symmetry was reported for similar compounds and infinite-layer Sr1-xLa2CuO2 in tunneling,[11, 12] Raman scattering,[13] penetration depth,[14] small-angle neutron scattering,[15] and specific heat[16] studies. Results of Biswas _et al._[17] and Skitna _et al._[18] suggest that there is a d- to s-wave transition across optimal doping in Nd2-,CeFeCuO4 and Pr2-,CeFeCuO4. The two-gap picture was also introduced in Refs. [19] and [20] in order to explain the unusual behavior of the magnetic penetration depth and Raman spectra.

Here we report a study of the in-plane magnetic field penetration depth \lambda_{ab} in the infinite-layer electron-doped superconductor Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 by means of transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF\muSR). This compound belongs to the family of electron-doped HTS's (SrL)CuO2 (L=La,Sm,Nd,Gd) with the so-called infinite-layer structure.[21, 22] It has the simplest crystal structure among all HTS's, consisting of an infinite stacking of CuO2 planes and (Sr, L) layers. The charge reservoir block, commonly present in HTS's, does not exist in the infinite-layer structure. It also has stoichiometric oxygen content without vacancies or interstitial oxygen,[23] which is a general problem for most of the electron- and hole-doped HTS's. In the present study \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) was reconstructed from the measured temperature dependences of the \muSR linewidth by applying the numerical calculations of Brandt.[24]\lambda_{ab} was found to be almost field independent, in contrast to the strong magnetic field dependence observed in the hole-doped HTS's, suggesting that there are no nodes in the superconducting energy gap of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2. The temperature dependence of \lambda_{ab}^{-2} was found to be well described by anisotropic s-wave as well as by two-gap models (d+s and s+s). In the case of the two-gap d+s model the contribution of the d-wave gap to the total superfluid density was found to be of the order of 15%. Our results imply that a substantial s-wave component in the superconducting order parameter is present in Sr0.9La0.1CuO2, in agreement with previously reported results of tunnelling,[22] specific heat,[16] and small-angle neutron scattering experiments.[15]

## II Experimental details

Details on the sample preparation for Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 can be found elsewhere.[25] The TF\muSR experiments were performed at the \piM3 beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The sintered Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 sample was field cooled from above T_{c} to 1.6 K in a series of fields ranging from 50 mT to 0.64 T.

In the transverse-field geometry, the local magnetic field distribution P(B) inside the superconducting sample in the mixed state, probed by means of TF\muSR, is determined by the values of the coherence length \xi and the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda. In extreme type-II superconductors  (\lambda  \xi) P(B) is almost independent of \xi and the second moment of P(B) becomes proportional to 1/\lambda^{4}.[26; 24] In order to describe the asymmetric local magnetic field distribution P(B) in the superconductor in the mixed state, the analysis of the data was based on a two-component Gaussian fit of the \muSR time spectra:[27]

\[P(t) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{2}{A_{i}\exp( - \sigma_{i}^{2}t^{2}/2)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t + \phi)}.\]

Here A_{i}, \sigma_{i}, and B_{i} are the asymmetry, the relaxation rate, and the mean field of the ith component, \gamma_{\mu} = 2 \pi x 135.5342 MHz/T denotes the muon gyromagnetic ratio, and \phi is the initial phase of the muon-spin ensemble. The total second moment of the \muSR line was derived as[27]

\[\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle = \frac{\sigma^{2}}{\gamma_{\mu}^{2}} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{2}{\frac{A_{i}}{A_{1} + A_{2}}\left[ \frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}}{\gamma_{\mu}^{2}} + \left( {B_{i} - \frac{A_{i}B_{i}}{A_{1} + A_{2}}} \right)^{2} \right\rbrack}.\]

The superconducting part of the square root of the second moment \sigma_{sc} was further obtained by subtracting the contribution of the nuclear moments \sigma_{\rm nm} measured at T > T_{c} as \sigma_{sc}^{2} = \sigma^{2} - \sigma_{\rm nm}^{2}.[28]

The following issue is important for the interpretation of the experimental data: The sample used in the experiment was a nonoriented sintered powder. In this case an effective averaged penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} can be extracted. However, in highly anisotropic extreme type-II superconductors (like HTS's) \lambda_{\rm eff} is dominated by the in-plane penetration depth so that \lambda_{\rm eff} \approx 1.31\lambda_{ab}.[29]

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependences of \sigma_{\rm sc}\alpha\lambda_{ab}^{-2} measured after field-cooling the sample from far above T_{c} in \mu_{0}H = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 T. Two features are clearly seen: (i) In the whole temperature region (from T \simeq 1.6 K up to T_{c}) \sigma_{\rm sc}(T,H) decreases with increasing field; and (ii) the curvature of \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) changes with field. With decreasing temperature \sigma_{\rm sc} at \mu_{0}H = 0.1 T first increases and then becomes T independent for T \approx 15 K, while \sigma_{\rm sc} for both \mu_{0}H = 0.3 and 0.6 T increases continuously in the whole range of temperatures. It is also seen that the low-temperature slope of \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) is larger at the higher fields.

The decrease of \sigma_{\rm sc} with increasing magnetic field is caused by the overlapping of the vortices by their cores, leading to a reduction of the field variance in the superconductor in the mixed state. As shown by Brandt,[24] at magnetic inductions B/B_{c2} \approx 0.1 (B_{c2} is the second critical field), overlapping of vortex cores may be neglected and vortex properties are independent of the applied magnetic field. Only the vortex density is changed. At higher magnetic inductions vortices start to overlap with their cores. Consequently, not only the vortex density, but also the properties of the individual vortices, become magnetic field dependent. Therefore, the different temperature behavior of \sigma_{\rm sc} can be explained by the fact that the vortex core size, which is generally assumed to be equal to the coherence length \xi=(\Phi_{0}/2\pi B_{c2})^{0.5}, increases with increasing temperature (decreasing B_{c2}). Thus higher temperature [bigger reduced field b(T) = B/B_{c2}(T)] would correspond to larger overlapping vortex cores, leading to a stronger reduction of \sigma_{\rm sc}. Consequently, the correcting factor between \sigma_{\rm sc} and the magnetic field penetration depth is _not constant_, as is generally assumed, but depends on the reduced field b:[24]

\[\sigma_{\rm sc}(b)\ \ (\mu s^{-1}) = A(b)[\chi_{\rm eff}^{-2}\ ({\rm nm}^{-2})\rbrack.\]

Here A(b) is a correcting factor, which for superconductors with a Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa = \lambda /\xi \equiv 5 in the range of fields 0.25 / \kappa \approx b \leq 1 can be obtained analytically as A(b) = 4.83 x 104 (1 - b)[1 + 1.21(1 - \sqrt{b})^{3}] \mus^{-1} nm^{2}.[24]

Equation (3) requires that, in order to derive \lambda from measured \sigma_{\rm sc}(T), the temperature dependence of B_{c2} must be taken into account. Since in our experiments the measured \lambda_{\rm eff} is determined by the in-plane component of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{ab} (see above), B_{c2}(T) has to be measured with the magnetic field applied parallel to the crystallographic c axis. The temperature dependence of B_{c2}^{\rm sc} presented in Fig. 2(a) was obtained from measurements of the reversible magnetization on the c-axis-oriented powder by using the Landau-Ott scaling approach.[30] The solid line represents a fit of B_{c2}^{\rm sc}(T) using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model[31] with B_{c2}^{\rm lc}(0) = 10.7(2) T. Note that B_{c2}^{\rm lc}(0) = 10.7(2) T obtained in the present study is close to that reported in the literature.[32; 33]

The correcting factor A [see Fig. 2(b)] was calculated within the framework of the numerical Ginzburg-Landau approach developed by Brandt[24] in the following way. First, A was calculated as a function of the reduced field b = B/B_{c2}. The inset in Fig. 2(b) shows A(b) = \sigma\lambda^{2} [see Eq. (3)] for a superconductor with \kappa = 15, 20, and 25. Vertical lines correspond to b = B/B_{c2}(0) for the fields used in the present study (0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.64 T). Second, by using the calculated WHH form of B_{c2}(T) [red solid line in Fig. 2(a)], values of A(T,B =  const) for each particular field B were reconstructed. Figure 2(b) shows the calculated A(T,B) at B = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.64 T for \kappa = 15, 20, and 25. Note that the influence of \kappa is only important at the lowest magnetic field (B = 0.05 T), while at the higher fields the effect of \kappa becomes almost  negligible. This allows us to estimate the absolute value of \lambda_{\rm eff} at low temperatures, which was found to be \lambda_{\rm eff}\approx 120 nm, in good agreement with previous results.[34] Bearing in mind that \lambda_{\rm eff}\approx 1.31\lambda_{ab} (Ref. [29]) and B_{c2}^{\rm L}=10.7 T [see Fig. 2(a)], the Ginzburg-Landau parameter was estimated to be \kappa\approx 17. This value of \kappa was used in the following calculations.

The normalized \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T,B)/\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0,B) curves reconstructed from the measured \sigma_{\rm sc}(T,B) are shown in Fig. 3. The inset shows \lambda_{ab}(0,B) obtained from the linear extrapolation of \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T,B) at T< 10 K to zero temperature. It should be emphasized here that it makes no sense to introduce any unique value of \lambda for each particular magnetic field, since only the zero-field value of \lambda has a physical meaning.[35] The same statement holds for the temperature behavior of \lambda^{-2}. This implies that if the theory used to reconstruct \lambda(T) from \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) measured in various magnetic fields is correct, then the corresponding \lambda(T) should _coincide_. The data presented in Fig. 3 reveal that this is the case. The normalized \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T,B)/\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0,B) curves merge together and the value of \lambda_{ab} at T=0, presented in the inset, is almost independent of the magnetic field. The small increase of \lambda_{ab}(0) at low fields can be explained by the pinning effects which can lead to a reduction of the second moment of P(B) in a powder HTS's at fields smaller than 0.1 T (see, e.g., Refs. [28; 36]).

Figure 4 shows \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) reconstructed by means of the above described procedure from \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) for one representative field value B= 0.1 T. The data in Fig. 4 were analyzed by using single-gap and two-gap models, assuming that the superconducting energy gaps have the following symmetries: d wave (a), anisotropic d wave (b), d+s wave (c), s wave (d), anisotropic s wave (e), and s+s wave (f). The analysis for both the d-wave and the isotropic s-wave gaps was made in the clean (\xi\ggl, where l is the meanfree path) and the dirty (\xi\lll) limits. The cases of anisotropic s- and d-wave gaps, as well as (s+s)- and (d+s)-wave gap symmetries were analyzed in the clean limit only.

In the clean limit the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda was calculated within the local (London) approximation (\lambda\gg\xi) by using the following equation:[2; 37]

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}\Bigg{|}_{\rm clean}=1+\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{\Delta(T,\varphi)}^{\infty}\Bigg{(}\frac{\partial f}{ \partial E}\Bigg{)}\frac{E\ dE\ d\varphi}{\langle\bar{E}^{2}-\Delta(T,\varphi )^{2}\rangle}.\] (4)

Here \lambda^{-2}(0) is the zero-temperature value of the magnetic penetration depth, f=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function, \varphi is the angle along the Fermi surface (\varphi= \pi/4 corresponds to a zone diagonal), and \Delta(T,\varphi)=\Delta_{0}\vec{\Delta}(T/T_{c})g(\varphi) (\Delta_{0} is the maximum gap value at T=0). The temperature dependence of the gap is approximated by \vec{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) =tanh{1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T-1)]^{0.51}).[38] The function g(\varphi) describes the angular dependence of the gap and is given by g^{s}(\varphi) = 1 for the s-wave gap, g^{d}(\varphi)=|\cos(2\varphi)| for the d-wave

[30]). The solid line is the fit of the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model (Ref. [31]) to the data with B_{c2}^{\rm L}(0)=10.7(2) T. (b) Temperature dependence of the correcting factor A at B=0.05, 0.1, and 0.6 T for \kappa=\lambda/\xi=15 (green line), 20 (blue line), and 25 (red line).

[24]).Vertical lines mark the values of B/B_{c2}(0) for B=0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.64 T.

  gap, g^{s_{\rm m}}(\varphi)=(1+a cos 4\varphi)/(1+a) for the anisotropic s-wave gap,[11] and g^{d}=(\varphi)\,  namics of the mixed state highly nonlocal, leading to an additional source for decreasing the superfluid density due to excitation of the quasiparticles along the nodal directions (see, e.g., Ref. [41] and references therein). In this case the proportionality coefficient A [see Eq. (3) and Fig. 2(b)] depends much more strongly on the reduced magnetic field and, as a consequence, on temperature than is expected in the case of conventional superconductors. However, the normalized \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T,B)/\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0,B) evaluated at various fields merge together (see Fig. 3), implying that Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} can be, indeed, described within the model developed for conventional isotropic superconductors.[24] (ii) The nonlocal and nonlinear response of a superconductor with nodes in the gap to the magnetic field leads to the fact that \lambda_{ab}(0), evaluated from \muSR experiments, becomes magnetic field dependent and increases with increasing field.[42] This behavior was observed in various hole-doped HTS's.[43, 44, 41] For comparison, in Fig. 5 we show \lambda(0,b) for Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} measured here and the one obtained by Sonier _et al.[43]_ for hole-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} Whereas \lambda_{ab}(0) for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} strongly increases with magnetic field, for Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} it is almost field independent.

Now we want to point to differences between Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} studied here and Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} and Pr_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}, electron-doped superconductors for which the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter was reported based on the results of angular resolved photoemission,[5, 6] scanning SQUID,[7] Raman scattering,[8] and magnetic penetration depth studies.[9, 10] First, the reversible magnetization experiments of Kim _et al.[32]_ reveal that the zero-temperature c-axis coherence length in Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} is longer then the c-axis lattice parameter. This suggests that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO_{2} plane overlaps with those of neighboring CuO_{2} planes for all temperatures below T_{c}. This would imply that the superconducting properties of the infinite-layer system are nearly three dimensional, as opposed to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of all other cuprates. Second, the superconductivity in the infinite-layer compound appears to be sensitive to the type of impurity. While nonmagnetic Zn has little effect on T_{c} for up to 3% concentration, strong suppression of T_{c} already occurs with 1% of Ni, and nearly complete suppression of T_{c} occurs with only 2% of Ni.[25] Thus, the response of the infinite-layer compound to impurities is different from that of other HTS's and it is more similar to the one observed in conventional superconductors. Third, isotropic s-wave gap symmetry of Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} was reported by Chen _et al.[12]_ based on the analysis of tunneling data. This statement was further confirmed in specific heat[16] and small-angle neutron scattering experiments.[15]

## IV IV. Summary and conclusions

Muon-spin rotation measurements were performed on the electron-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductor Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} (T_{c}\approx 43 K). \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) was reconstructed from the measured temperature dependence of the \muSR linewidth by using numerical calculations of Brandt.[24] The main results are as follows. (i) The absolute value of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{ab} at T=0 was found to be \lambda_{ab}(0) =93(2) nm. (ii) \lambda_{ab} is independent of the magnetic field, in contrast to the strong magnetic field dependence observed in hole-doped HTS's. This suggests that there are no nodes in the superconducting energy gap of Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2}. (iii) The temperature dependence of \lambda_{ab}^{-2} was found to be inconsistent with isotropic s-wave as well as with a d-wave symmetry of the superconducting energy gap, in both the clean and the dirty limits. (iv) \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) is well described by anisotropic s-wave and two-gap models (d+s and s+s). In the case of the two-gap d+s model, the contribution of the d-wave gap to the total superfluid density was estimated to be \approx15%. To conclude, a substantial s-wave component in the superconducting order parameter is present in Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2}, in agreement with previously reported results of tunneling,[12] specific heat,[16] and small-angle neutron scattering experiments.[15]

###### Abstract

We report on measurements of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{ab} in the infinite-layer electron-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductor Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 by means of muon-spin rotation. The observed temperature and magnetic field dependences of \lambda_{ab} are consistent with the presence of a substantial s-wave component in the superconducting order parameter, in good agreement with the results of tunneling, specific heat, and small-angle neutron scattering experiments.

## I Introduction

The symmetry of the superconducting energy gap is one of the essential issues for understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. For hole-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductors (HTS's) it is commonly accepted that the superconducting energy gap has d-wave symmetry, as indicated, e.g., by tricrystal experiments, although overwhelming evidence is now accumulating for a multicomponent [(d+s)-wave] gap.[2, 3, 4] For electron-doped HTS's, however, no consensus has been reached on this issue so far. A number of experiments, including angular resolved photoemission,[5, 6] scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements,[7] Raman scattering,[8] and magnetic penetration depth studies,[9, 10] point to a d-wave, or, more generally, to a nonmonotonic d-wave gap (with the gap maximum between the nodal and antinodal points on the Fermi surface) in electron-doped Nd2-CeFeCuO4 and Pr2-CeFeCuO4. On the contrary, a state corresponding to an s-or a nonmonotonic s-wave gap symmetry was reported for similar compounds and infinite-layer Sr1-xLa2CuO2 in tunneling,[11, 12] Raman scattering,[13] penetration depth,[14] small-angle neutron scattering,[15] and specific heat[16] studies. Results of Biswas _et al._[17] and Skitna _et al._[18] suggest that there is a d- to s-wave transition across optimal doping in Nd2-,CeFeCuO4 and Pr2-,CeFeCuO4. The two-gap picture was also introduced in Refs. [19] and [20] in order to explain the unusual behavior of the magnetic penetration depth and Raman spectra.

Here we report a study of the in-plane magnetic field penetration depth \lambda_{ab} in the infinite-layer electron-doped superconductor Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 by means of transverse-field muon-spin rotation (TF\muSR). This compound belongs to the family of electron-doped HTS's (SrL)CuO2 (L=La,Sm,Nd,Gd) with the so-called infinite-layer structure.[21, 22] It has the simplest crystal structure among all HTS's, consisting of an infinite stacking of CuO2 planes and (Sr, L) layers. The charge reservoir block, commonly present in HTS's, does not exist in the infinite-layer structure. It also has stoichiometric oxygen content without vacancies or interstitial oxygen,[23] which is a general problem for most of the electron- and hole-doped HTS's. In the present study \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) was reconstructed from the measured temperature dependences of the \muSR linewidth by applying the numerical calculations of Brandt.[24]\lambda_{ab} was found to be almost field independent, in contrast to the strong magnetic field dependence observed in the hole-doped HTS's, suggesting that there are no nodes in the superconducting energy gap of Sr0.9La0.1CuO2. The temperature dependence of \lambda_{ab}^{-2} was found to be well described by anisotropic s-wave as well as by two-gap models (d+s and s+s). In the case of the two-gap d+s model the contribution of the d-wave gap to the total superfluid density was found to be of the order of 15%. Our results imply that a substantial s-wave component in the superconducting order parameter is present in Sr0.9La0.1CuO2, in agreement with previously reported results of tunnelling,[22] specific heat,[16] and small-angle neutron scattering experiments.[15]

## II Experimental details

Details on the sample preparation for Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 can be found elsewhere.[25] The TF\muSR experiments were performed at the \piM3 beamline at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). The sintered Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 sample was field cooled from above T_{c} to 1.6 K in a series of fields ranging from 50 mT to 0.64 T.

In the transverse-field geometry, the local magnetic field distribution P(B) inside the superconducting sample in the mixed state, probed by means of TF\muSR, is determined by the values of the coherence length \xi and the magnetic field penetration depth \lambda. In extreme type-II superconductors  (\lambda  \xi) P(B) is almost independent of \xi and the second moment of P(B) becomes proportional to 1/\lambda^{4}.[26; 24] In order to describe the asymmetric local magnetic field distribution P(B) in the superconductor in the mixed state, the analysis of the data was based on a two-component Gaussian fit of the \muSR time spectra:[27]

\[P(t) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{2}{A_{i}\exp( - \sigma_{i}^{2}t^{2}/2)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t + \phi)}.\]

Here A_{i}, \sigma_{i}, and B_{i} are the asymmetry, the relaxation rate, and the mean field of the ith component, \gamma_{\mu} = 2 \pi x 135.5342 MHz/T denotes the muon gyromagnetic ratio, and \phi is the initial phase of the muon-spin ensemble. The total second moment of the \muSR line was derived as[27]

\[\langle\Delta B^{2}\rangle = \frac{\sigma^{2}}{\gamma_{\mu}^{2}} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{2}{\frac{A_{i}}{A_{1} + A_{2}}\left[ \frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}}{\gamma_{\mu}^{2}} + \left( {B_{i} - \frac{A_{i}B_{i}}{A_{1} + A_{2}}} \right)^{2} \right\rbrack}.\]

The superconducting part of the square root of the second moment \sigma_{sc} was further obtained by subtracting the contribution of the nuclear moments \sigma_{\rm nm} measured at T > T_{c} as \sigma_{sc}^{2} = \sigma^{2} - \sigma_{\rm nm}^{2}.[28]

The following issue is important for the interpretation of the experimental data: The sample used in the experiment was a nonoriented sintered powder. In this case an effective averaged penetration depth \lambda_{\rm eff} can be extracted. However, in highly anisotropic extreme type-II superconductors (like HTS's) \lambda_{\rm eff} is dominated by the in-plane penetration depth so that \lambda_{\rm eff} \approx 1.31\lambda_{ab}.[29]

## III Results and Discussion

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependences of \sigma_{\rm sc}\alpha\lambda_{ab}^{-2} measured after field-cooling the sample from far above T_{c} in \mu_{0}H = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6 T. Two features are clearly seen: (i) In the whole temperature region (from T \simeq 1.6 K up to T_{c}) \sigma_{\rm sc}(T,H) decreases with increasing field; and (ii) the curvature of \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) changes with field. With decreasing temperature \sigma_{\rm sc} at \mu_{0}H = 0.1 T first increases and then becomes T independent for T \approx 15 K, while \sigma_{\rm sc} for both \mu_{0}H = 0.3 and 0.6 T increases continuously in the whole range of temperatures. It is also seen that the low-temperature slope of \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) is larger at the higher fields.

The decrease of \sigma_{\rm sc} with increasing magnetic field is caused by the overlapping of the vortices by their cores, leading to a reduction of the field variance in the superconductor in the mixed state. As shown by Brandt,[24] at magnetic inductions B/B_{c2} \approx 0.1 (B_{c2} is the second critical field), overlapping of vortex cores may be neglected and vortex properties are independent of the applied magnetic field. Only the vortex density is changed. At higher magnetic inductions vortices start to overlap with their cores. Consequently, not only the vortex density, but also the properties of the individual vortices, become magnetic field dependent. Therefore, the different temperature behavior of \sigma_{\rm sc} can be explained by the fact that the vortex core size, which is generally assumed to be equal to the coherence length \xi=(\Phi_{0}/2\pi B_{c2})^{0.5}, increases with increasing temperature (decreasing B_{c2}). Thus higher temperature [bigger reduced field b(T) = B/B_{c2}(T)] would correspond to larger overlapping vortex cores, leading to a stronger reduction of \sigma_{\rm sc}. Consequently, the correcting factor between \sigma_{\rm sc} and the magnetic field penetration depth is _not constant_, as is generally assumed, but depends on the reduced field b:[24]

\[\sigma_{\rm sc}(b)\ \ (\mu s^{-1}) = A(b)[\chi_{\rm eff}^{-2}\ ({\rm nm}^{-2})\rbrack.\]

Here A(b) is a correcting factor, which for superconductors with a Ginzburg-Landau parameter \kappa = \lambda /\xi \equiv 5 in the range of fields 0.25 / \kappa \approx b \leq 1 can be obtained analytically as A(b) = 4.83 x 104 (1 - b)[1 + 1.21(1 - \sqrt{b})^{3}] \mus^{-1} nm^{2}.[24]

Equation (3) requires that, in order to derive \lambda from measured \sigma_{\rm sc}(T), the temperature dependence of B_{c2} must be taken into account. Since in our experiments the measured \lambda_{\rm eff} is determined by the in-plane component of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{ab} (see above), B_{c2}(T) has to be measured with the magnetic field applied parallel to the crystallographic c axis. The temperature dependence of B_{c2}^{\rm sc} presented in Fig. 2(a) was obtained from measurements of the reversible magnetization on the c-axis-oriented powder by using the Landau-Ott scaling approach.[30] The solid line represents a fit of B_{c2}^{\rm sc}(T) using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model[31] with B_{c2}^{\rm lc}(0) = 10.7(2) T. Note that B_{c2}^{\rm lc}(0) = 10.7(2) T obtained in the present study is close to that reported in the literature.[32; 33]

The correcting factor A [see Fig. 2(b)] was calculated within the framework of the numerical Ginzburg-Landau approach developed by Brandt[24] in the following way. First, A was calculated as a function of the reduced field b = B/B_{c2}. The inset in Fig. 2(b) shows A(b) = \sigma\lambda^{2} [see Eq. (3)] for a superconductor with \kappa = 15, 20, and 25. Vertical lines correspond to b = B/B_{c2}(0) for the fields used in the present study (0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.64 T). Second, by using the calculated WHH form of B_{c2}(T) [red solid line in Fig. 2(a)], values of A(T,B =  const) for each particular field B were reconstructed. Figure 2(b) shows the calculated A(T,B) at B = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.64 T for \kappa = 15, 20, and 25. Note that the influence of \kappa is only important at the lowest magnetic field (B = 0.05 T), while at the higher fields the effect of \kappa becomes almost  negligible. This allows us to estimate the absolute value of \lambda_{\rm eff} at low temperatures, which was found to be \lambda_{\rm eff}\approx 120 nm, in good agreement with previous results.[34] Bearing in mind that \lambda_{\rm eff}\approx 1.31\lambda_{ab} (Ref. [29]) and B_{c2}^{\rm L}=10.7 T [see Fig. 2(a)], the Ginzburg-Landau parameter was estimated to be \kappa\approx 17. This value of \kappa was used in the following calculations.

The normalized \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T,B)/\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0,B) curves reconstructed from the measured \sigma_{\rm sc}(T,B) are shown in Fig. 3. The inset shows \lambda_{ab}(0,B) obtained from the linear extrapolation of \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T,B) at T< 10 K to zero temperature. It should be emphasized here that it makes no sense to introduce any unique value of \lambda for each particular magnetic field, since only the zero-field value of \lambda has a physical meaning.[35] The same statement holds for the temperature behavior of \lambda^{-2}. This implies that if the theory used to reconstruct \lambda(T) from \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) measured in various magnetic fields is correct, then the corresponding \lambda(T) should _coincide_. The data presented in Fig. 3 reveal that this is the case. The normalized \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T,B)/\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0,B) curves merge together and the value of \lambda_{ab} at T=0, presented in the inset, is almost independent of the magnetic field. The small increase of \lambda_{ab}(0) at low fields can be explained by the pinning effects which can lead to a reduction of the second moment of P(B) in a powder HTS's at fields smaller than 0.1 T (see, e.g., Refs. [28; 36]).

Figure 4 shows \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) reconstructed by means of the above described procedure from \sigma_{\rm sc}(T) for one representative field value B= 0.1 T. The data in Fig. 4 were analyzed by using single-gap and two-gap models, assuming that the superconducting energy gaps have the following symmetries: d wave (a), anisotropic d wave (b), d+s wave (c), s wave (d), anisotropic s wave (e), and s+s wave (f). The analysis for both the d-wave and the isotropic s-wave gaps was made in the clean (\xi\ggl, where l is the meanfree path) and the dirty (\xi\lll) limits. The cases of anisotropic s- and d-wave gaps, as well as (s+s)- and (d+s)-wave gap symmetries were analyzed in the clean limit only.

In the clean limit the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda was calculated within the local (London) approximation (\lambda\gg\xi) by using the following equation:[2; 37]

\[\frac{\lambda^{-2}(T)}{\lambda^{-2}(0)}\Bigg{|}_{\rm clean}=1+\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{\Delta(T,\varphi)}^{\infty}\Bigg{(}\frac{\partial f}{ \partial E}\Bigg{)}\frac{E\ dE\ d\varphi}{\langle\bar{E}^{2}-\Delta(T,\varphi )^{2}\rangle}.\] (4)

Here \lambda^{-2}(0) is the zero-temperature value of the magnetic penetration depth, f=[1+\exp(E/k_{B}T)]^{-1} is the Fermi function, \varphi is the angle along the Fermi surface (\varphi= \pi/4 corresponds to a zone diagonal), and \Delta(T,\varphi)=\Delta_{0}\vec{\Delta}(T/T_{c})g(\varphi) (\Delta_{0} is the maximum gap value at T=0). The temperature dependence of the gap is approximated by \vec{\Delta}(T/T_{c}) =tanh{1.82[1.018(T_{c}/T-1)]^{0.51}).[38] The function g(\varphi) describes the angular dependence of the gap and is given by g^{s}(\varphi) = 1 for the s-wave gap, g^{d}(\varphi)=|\cos(2\varphi)| for the d-wave

[30]). The solid line is the fit of the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model (Ref. [31]) to the data with B_{c2}^{\rm L}(0)=10.7(2) T. (b) Temperature dependence of the correcting factor A at B=0.05, 0.1, and 0.6 T for \kappa=\lambda/\xi=15 (green line), 20 (blue line), and 25 (red line). The inset shows \lambda(b)=\sigma\lambda^{2} obtained from numerical calculations using the model of Brandt (Ref. [24]).Vertical lines mark the values of B/B_{c2}(0) for B=0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.64 T.

  gap, g^{s_{\rm m}}(\varphi)=(1+a cos 4\varphi)/(1+a) for the anisotropic s-wave gap,[11] and g^{d}=(\varphi)\,  namics of the mixed state highly nonlocal, leading to an additional source for decreasing the superfluid density due to excitation of the quasiparticles along the nodal directions (see, e.g., Ref. [41] and references therein). In this case the proportionality coefficient A [see Eq. (3) and Fig. 2(b)] depends much more strongly on the reduced magnetic field and, as a consequence, on temperature than is expected in the case of conventional superconductors. However, the normalized \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T,B)/\lambda_{ab}^{-2}(0,B) evaluated at various fields merge together (see Fig. 3), implying that Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} can be, indeed, described within the model developed for conventional isotropic superconductors.[24] (ii) The nonlocal and nonlinear response of a superconductor with nodes in the gap to the magnetic field leads to the fact that \lambda_{ab}(0), evaluated from \muSR experiments, becomes magnetic field dependent and increases with increasing field.[42] This behavior was observed in various hole-doped HTS's.[43, 44, 41] For comparison, in Fig. 5 we show \lambda(0,b) for Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} measured here and the one obtained by Sonier _et al.[43]_ for hole-doped YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} Whereas \lambda_{ab}(0) for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta} strongly increases with magnetic field, for Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} it is almost field independent.

Now we want to point to differences between Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} studied here and Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} and Pr_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}, electron-doped superconductors for which the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter was reported based on the results of angular resolved photoemission,[5, 6] scanning SQUID,[7] Raman scattering,[8] and magnetic penetration depth studies.[9, 10] First, the reversible magnetization experiments of Kim _et al.[32]_ reveal that the zero-temperature c-axis coherence length in Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} is longer then the c-axis lattice parameter. This suggests that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO_{2} plane overlaps with those of neighboring CuO_{2} planes for all temperatures below T_{c}. This would imply that the superconducting properties of the infinite-layer system are nearly three dimensional, as opposed to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of all other cuprates. Second, the superconductivity in the infinite-layer compound appears to be sensitive to the type of impurity. While nonmagnetic Zn has little effect on T_{c} for up to 3% concentration, strong suppression of T_{c} already occurs with 1% of Ni, and nearly complete suppression of T_{c} occurs with only 2% of Ni.[25] Thus, the response of the infinite-layer compound to impurities is different from that of other HTS's and it is more similar to the one observed in conventional superconductors. Third, isotropic s-wave gap symmetry of Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} was reported by Chen _et al.[12]_ based on the analysis of tunneling data. This statement was further confirmed in specific heat[16] and small-angle neutron scattering experiments.[15]

## IV IV. Summary and conclusions

Muon-spin rotation measurements were performed on the electron-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductor Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2} (T_{c}\approx 43 K). \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) was reconstructed from the measured temperature dependence of the \muSR linewidth by using numerical calculations of Brandt.[24] The main results are as follows. (i) The absolute value of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{ab} at T=0 was found to be \lambda_{ab}(0) =93(2) nm. (ii) \lambda_{ab} is independent of the magnetic field, in contrast to the strong magnetic field dependence observed in hole-doped HTS's. This suggests that there are no nodes in the superconducting energy gap of Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2}. (iii) The temperature dependence of \lambda_{ab}^{-2} was found to be inconsistent with isotropic s-wave as well as with a d-wave symmetry of the superconducting energy gap, in both the clean and the dirty limits. (iv) \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) is well described by anisotropic s-wave and two-gap models (d+s and s+s). In the case of the two-gap d+s model, the contribution of the d-wave gap to the total superfluid density was estimated to be \approx15%. To conclude, a substantial s-wave component in the superconducting order parameter is present in Sr_{0.9}La_{0.1}CuO_{2}, in agreement with previously reported results of tunneling,[12] specific heat,[16] and small-angle neutron scattering experiments.[15]
