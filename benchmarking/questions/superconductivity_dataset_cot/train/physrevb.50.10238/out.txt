###### Abstract

Our x-ray core-level spectroscopic measurements show that the valence state of Tl in Ba containing single-Tl-O-layered compounds TlBa2Ca_1-_x_La_CuO_5 and TlBa2Ca_1-_x_Gd_x_CuO2O_7 is + 3 whereas in Sr containing single-Tl-O-layered compounds TlSr2-_x_La_CuO_5 and TlSr2Ca_1-_x_Gd_x_CuO2O_7 is between +3 and +1. The origin of holes in the latter is discussed in terms of charge transfer between the Tl 6s band and the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band in addition to the holes generated due to excess oxygen. This is in contrast to the former wherein the origin of the holes is due to the excess of oxygen only.

## I Introduction

Holes in double-Tl-O-layered high-_T_c superconductors (hereafter referred to as Tl-2) Tl2Ba2Ca_n_-1Cu_n_O_2n_+4 (_n_ = 1 - 4) are generated mainly by overlap of the empty Tl 6s band with antibonding of the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 bands at the Fermi level.1-3 Single-Tl-O-layered compounds TlBa2Ca_n_-1Cu_n_O_2n_+3 (_n_ = 1 - 5), to be called TlBa-1, are overdoped, optimally doped, or underdoped depending upon the number n of the CuO2 layers, except for n = 1. This is because excess oxygen, according to the above formula, depends on n, the number of neighboring CuO2 layers.4,5 In the case of n = 1, the copper must be present in the + 3 oxidation state and is not expected to superconduct. In fact, synthesis of this material as a single phase is very difficult. In Tl-2 compounds, there are eight Tl-Tl nearest-neighbor ions which make the Tl 6s band broader in comparison to that in Tl-1 compounds in which case there are only four Tl-Tl nearest-neighbor ions per primitive cell (see Fig. 1). As a result, the empty Tl 6s band in Tl-2 compounds lies below the Fermi level, in contrast to Tl-1 compounds where it lies above the Fermi level, and overlaps with a lower Hubbard band of Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band. This leads to the creation of holes in the latter and an increase in the electron density in the former. As a consequence, there is a reduction of the Tl valence from +3.6 The Tl 6s band in TlBa-1 compounds does not overlap with the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band. Thus the holes are generated due to excess oxygen, the valence state of Tl remaining + 3.7

There is yet another series of single-Tl-O-layered compounds namely, TlSr2Ca_n_-1Cu_n_O_2n_+3 (Refs. 8 - 10) to be called TlSr-1. They are isostructural with TlBa-1 compounds, n being 1, 2, and 3 only. Materials belonging to these two series differ in their superconducting properties. For example, TlBaLaCuO5 (TlBa-1:2:0:1) is a semiconductor11 whereas the isostructural compound TlSrLaCuO3 (TlSr-1:2:0:1) is a superconductor.12 In the second member of the TlSr-1 series, TlSr2CaCu2O7 (Ref. 13) (TlSr-1:2:1:2) the superconductivity is retained for relatively higher value of rare-earth substitution at the 8

  coordinated Ca site or 9-coordinated Sr site compared to that in the TlBa-1 series.[14] It had been suggested theoretically,[15] and shown experimentally by x-ray-photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements that the origin of holes in TlSrLaCuO_{5} is due to the overlap of the Tl 6s band with the Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band.[7] We suspected that this mechanism may be operative in the TlSr-1:2:1:2 also. In order to understand the origin of holes in Tl_A__{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+3} (_A_ = Ba,Sr; n = 1,2), and the difference in superconducting behavior between TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5}, TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} and TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7}, we undertook XPS investigations on these materials. This paper reports the results of these studies.

## II Experimental

The method of preparation of Tl_A__{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and Tl(_A_)_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} (_A_ = Ba, Sr) with various values of x has been described elsewhere,[7] except that the sintering temperature for Tl-1:2:1:2 was 900 degC. All the samples were annealed in oxygen after presintering. Phase purity of the samples was checked by powder x-ray-diffraction (XRD) with a JEOL 8030 x-ray diffractometer using Cu _K_\alpha radiation (within the resolution of the instrument, typically a few percent). The superconducting property was studied by dc-electrical resistance measurements. The valence state of thallium was studied by x-ray core-level photoelectron spectroscopy measurements under ultrahigh vacuum (\sim 10^{-9} Torr) using a VG Escalab MkII spectrometer equipped with a nonmono-chromatized Mg _K_\alpha x-ray (_h_\nu=1253.6 eV) source. Energy resolution of the instrument was better than 0.7 eV which is relative to metallic silver.[16, 17] Binding-energy (BE) values were obtained from the peak position after subtracting the background linearly. The uncertainty in determining the BE values is +-0.1 eV. Since these samples have well-known surface contamination problems, we have taken maximum care to minimize the effects by scraping the sample thoroughly over the surface with a stainless steel blade _in situ_ under ultrahigh vacuum. Before scraping, these samples showed a high intense C 1s peak at BE = 289 eV and a double-peak structure for O 1s with BE in the range 528-532 eV. After scraping the surface of the material thoroughly, no C 1s peak was observed and only one O 1s peak was observed at 528.7 eV showing the absence of carbonate impurities. The Tl 4f core-level spectra were recorded after scrapping. Silver paint was used to minimize the charging. However, the metallic samples did not show any charging.

In order to measure the BE of instrumental C 1s, in the absence of carbonate impurity, the samples were allowed in the vacuum chamber for 2-3 h to accumulate the instrumental carbon over the sample surface. The BE value of the C 1s peak was determined to be 285.0 eV. BE values of the samples are referenced to this value. Tl_{2}O_{3} was used as a standard for Tl^{3+}, while for Tl^{4+} the values of BE was taken from McGuire, Schweitzer, and Carlson.[18]

## III Results and Discussion

TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} (0.0 \leq x \leq 1.0)

#### Structure and superconductivity

XRD patterns of TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} showed that the samples with 0.2 \leq x \leq 1.0 and 0.6 \leq x \leq 1.0, respectively, are single phase. The spectra of Ba-containing samples, however, indicated the presence of traces of BaCO_{3} impurity which basically are confined to the surface of the sample. Our XPS spectra (as discussed in experimental) do suggest that BaCO_{3} is present only at the surface of the material. All the other diffraction lines could be indexed on the basis of tetragonal 1:2:0:1 phase, (space group P4/_mmm_). The lattice parameters a and c, obtained from least-square fitting procedure, in both TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} are plotted as a function of x in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. While discussing the variation of a with La^{3+} concentration in Tl_A__{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} (_A_ = Ba,Sr) one should consider the following two competing effects. (i) _Ionic size effect_, the effect due to different sizes of the ions involved: On substituting bigger _A_^{2+} ions (the radii of Ba^{2+} and Sr^{2+} ions are \sim1.47 and \sim 1.31 A, respectively, for ninefold coordination) by smaller La^{3+} ions (radius \sim 1.21 A for ninefold coordination[19]), one expects a decrease in both a and c. (ii) _Valence effect_, the effect due to the difference in the valence of the ions: Since the Cu-O bonds have antibonding character in the CuO_{2} layer (d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} bands[20]), substitution of divalent Ba(Sr) ions by trivalent La^{3+} ions introduces an extra electron, which is accommodated in the CuO_{2} layers, thereby reducing the Cu valence. This should result in an increase in the in-plane bond length r_{\text{Cu-O}}. This effect increases primarily a because, in general, the inplane r_{\text{Cu-O}} in single- and double-Tl-O-layered compounds is close to one-half of the lattice parameter a.

Figure 2: Variation of lattice parameters a (▲) and c (○) with x in TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5}. Both the lattice parameters decrease with increase of x. This is consistent with the ionic size effect (see text).

  In the case of A = Ba, the _ionic size effect_ is more important because of the large differences in the sizes of the ions involved. In the case of A = Sr, the _valence effect_ outweighs the first effect, resulting in a slight increase of a.

Electrical resistance measurements show that the materials TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 and TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 superconduct for x in the range 0.4 <= x <= 0.9 and 0.8 <= x <= 1.0, respectively. Superconducting transition temperature T_{c} in the system TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 is plotted as a function of x in Fig. 4. Samples with x = 0.2 in TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 and x = 0.6 in TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 show metallic behavior and a broad drop in resistance, but did not reach a zero resistance state down to 12 K. This implies that the materials are overdoped with holes. From Fig. 4, it is clear that the variation of T_{c} with x in TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 is similar to what has been observed in other high-_T__c_ materials, for example in La2-_x_Sr_x_CuO_4.21 Materials in the range 0.2 <= x < 0.7 and 0.7 < x <= 0.9 are, respectively, overdoped and underdoped with holes. It is important to note that in the case of TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5, only samples with x = 0.8 and 1.0 superconduct with T_{c} = 27 and 32 K, respectively. Metallic behavior of resistance with temperature and variation of T_{c} with x show that the system TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 with 0.6 <= x < 1.0 is in the overdoped state.

_XPS of Tl 4f7/2 core level in TlBa2-_x_La_CuO_5 and TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 (_x_ = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0)

The XPS of Tl 4f7/2 core-level BE in Tl2O3 is 117.7 eV which is consistent with the reported value.16 The BE of the Tl 4f7/2 core level is 117.7 eV for x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 in TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5. This value is in good agreement with the value of 117.7 eV for Tl 4f7/2 in Tl2O3. This suggests that the valence state of Tl in superconducting TlBa2-_x_La_CuO_5 (_x_ = 0.6 and 0.8) and nonsuperconducting TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 (_x_ = 1.0) is + 3. This implies that the Tl 6s band lies above the Fermi level and thus does not remove electrons from the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band. Thus the holes are generated owing to the excess oxygen only. These results provide support to the calculations of electronic band structure in TlBa2CuO5.1

XPS of Tl 4f7/2 in TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 (_x_ = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) is shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen from the figure, the BE of the Tl 4f7/2 core level in these compounds has moved up (BE = 118.3, 118.2, and 118.1 eV for x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively) suggesting that, the valence state of Tl is between +3 and +1 as the near-neighbor environment of Tl ions remains essentially the same in these materials. Decrease of BE with an increase of the concentration of La3+ ions is consistent with the fact that the addition of an extra electron, contributed by lanthanum ion, into the band of the antibonding Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 orbitals could result in a decrease of effective overlap of the Tl 6s band with the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band and hence the decrease in electron density in the Tl 6s band. From the chemical bonding considerations, addition of electrons into the antibonding band increases in the-plane Cu-O bond length _r_CuO. This is clearly reflected in the lattice parameter a which increases with the increase of concentration of La3+ ions. This situation is to be contrasted with that in the system TlBa1-_x_Sr_x_La_CuO_5.7 In this system, an increase of BE and T_{c} with the increase of iso-valent Sr2+ ion concentration reveals that this system moves from being underdoped (_x_ > 0.4) to being optimally doped.

Single-phase samples could be obtained for 0.4 <= x <= 1.0 in TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} except the presence of traces of an impurity for x = 0.4. Lattice parameters for both systems are listed in Table 1. It should be noted that in both systems, lattice parameter a increases, whereas parameter c decreases, with increase of x. This is because, the variation of the a parameter is primarily due to the _valence effect_ (mentioned above) and the decrease of the c parameter is due to the substitution of bigger Ca^{2+} ions by smaller Gd^{3+} ions, the _ionic size effect_. Resistance measurement show that the compound TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7}, x = 0.3, superconductors with T_{c} = 78 K. The compound with x = 1.0 is a semiconductor. In the case of the system TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} the compounds with x = 0.4 and 0.6 superconduct with T_{c} = 65 and 60 K, respectively. Compounds with x = 0.8 do not superconduct down to 12 K and x = 1.0 is a semiconductor just as TlBa_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7}.

_XPS of Tl 4/7/2 core level in TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} (_x_ = 0.3 _and 1.0) and TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} (_x_ = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0)_

The BE of the Tl 4/7/2 core level in TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} with x = 0.3 and 1.0 is listed in Table 1. The BE of Tl 4/7/2 in superconducting TlBa_{2}Ca_{0.7}Gd_{0.3}Cu_{2}O_{7} and nonsuperconducting TlBa_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7} is 117.7 eV. This value implies that the valence state of Tl in these compounds is + 3, in agreement with electronic band-structure calculations and high-energy spectroscopic studies.1,2 The BE of Tl 4/7/2 in TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} is also listed in Table 1. The BE of Tl 4/7/2 in samples with x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively is 118.3, 118.2, and 118.1 eV suggesting that the valence of Tl is systematically moving towards +3. This suggests that the system TlSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7}, just like TlSr_{2}CuO_{5}, has more Cu^{3+} content because of the holes generated due to overlap of Tl 6s band with Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band in addition to those generated due to excess oxygen. Decrease of BE and T_{c} with x suggests that the system TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} with x (> 0.4) moves towards being underdoped. In this respect, this material is different from the system TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5}, although the BE values are similar and vary in a similar fashion. TlSrLaCuO_{5} with a BE of 118.1 eV is a superconductor, whereas TlSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7} with the same BE is not a superconductor. This is because in the system TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7}, holes which are generated by the redox mechanism are divided between two CuO_{2} layers whereas in TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} the holes belong to only one CuO_{2} layer. In TlSr-1:2:0:1 and TlSr-1:2:1:2 systems the redox mechanism becomes effective because of relatively smaller lattice parameter compared with, respectively, isostructural TlBa-1:2:0:1 and TlBa-1:2:1:2 materials. In the case of Tl-2 compounds it is due to the higher number (eight) of Tl-T1 nearest-neighbor interaction, as mentioned above, compared to single-Tl-O-layered compounds where there are only four Tl-T1 nearest neighbors.

## IV Conclusion

The XPS of Tl 4/7/2 in single-Tl-O-layered TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} show that the valence state of Tl is between +3 and +1, implying that holes are generated due to the redox mechanism also in addition to the holes being generated due to excess oxygen. Our measurement on the isostructural TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} systems show that the Tl valence is essentially +3. Thus elec

  trons are not transferred from CuO_{2} layers into the Tl 6s band in these two systems. Smaller values of lattice parameters in TlSr-1:2:0:1 and TlSr-1:2:1:2 compared to that in TlBa-1:2:0:1 and TlBa-1:2:1:2 are responsible for the presence of the redox mechanism of hole generation.

###### Abstract

Our x-ray core-level spectroscopic measurements show that the valence state of Tl in Ba containing single-Tl-O-layered compounds TlBa2Ca_1-_x_La_CuO_5 and TlBa2Ca_1-_x_Gd_x_CuO2O_7 is + 3 whereas in Sr containing single-Tl-O-layered compounds TlSr2-_x_La_CuO_5 and TlSr2Ca_1-_x_Gd_x_CuO2O_7 is between +3 and +1. The origin of holes in the latter is discussed in terms of charge transfer between the Tl 6s band and the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band in addition to the holes generated due to excess oxygen. This is in contrast to the former wherein the origin of the holes is due to the excess of oxygen only.

## I Introduction

Holes in double-Tl-O-layered high-_T_c superconductors (hereafter referred to as Tl-2) Tl2Ba2Ca_n_-1Cu_n_O_2n_+4 (_n_ = 1 - 4) are generated mainly by overlap of the empty Tl 6s band with antibonding of the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 bands at the Fermi level.1-3 Single-Tl-O-layered compounds TlBa2Ca_n_-1Cu_n_O_2n_+3 (_n_ = 1 - 5), to be called TlBa-1, are overdoped, optimally doped, or underdoped depending upon the number n of the CuO2 layers, except for n = 1. This is because excess oxygen, according to the above formula, depends on n, the number of neighboring CuO2 layers.4,5 In the case of n = 1, the copper must be present in the + 3 oxidation state and is not expected to superconduct. In fact, synthesis of this material as a single phase is very difficult. In Tl-2 compounds, there are eight Tl-Tl nearest-neighbor ions which make the Tl 6s band broader in comparison to that in Tl-1 compounds in which case there are only four Tl-Tl nearest-neighbor ions per primitive cell (see Fig. 1). As a result, the empty Tl 6s band in Tl-2 compounds lies below the Fermi level, in contrast to Tl-1 compounds where it lies above the Fermi level, and overlaps with a lower Hubbard band of Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band. This leads to the creation of holes in the latter and an increase in the electron density in the former. As a consequence, there is a reduction of the Tl valence from +3.6 The Tl 6s band in TlBa-1 compounds does not overlap with the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band. Thus the holes are generated due to excess oxygen, the valence state of Tl remaining + 3.7

There is yet another series of single-Tl-O-layered compounds namely, TlSr2Ca_n_-1Cu_n_O_2n_+3 (Refs. 8 - 10) to be called TlSr-1. They are isostructural with TlBa-1 compounds, n being 1, 2, and 3 only. Materials belonging to these two series differ in their superconducting properties. For example, TlBaLaCuO5 (TlBa-1:2:0:1) is a semiconductor11 whereas the isostructural compound TlSrLaCuO3 (TlSr-1:2:0:1) is a superconductor.12 In the second member of the TlSr-1 series, TlSr2CaCu2O7 (Ref. 13) (TlSr-1:2:1:2) the superconductivity is retained for relatively higher value of rare-earth substitution at the 8

  coordinated Ca site or 9-coordinated Sr site compared to that in the TlBa-1 series.[14] It had been suggested theoretically,[15] and shown experimentally by x-ray-photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements that the origin of holes in TlSrLaCuO_{5} is due to the overlap of the Tl 6s band with the Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band.[7] We suspected that this mechanism may be operative in the TlSr-1:2:1:2 also. In order to understand the origin of holes in Tl_A__{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+3} (_A_ = Ba,Sr; n = 1,2), and the difference in superconducting behavior between TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5}, TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} and TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7}, we undertook XPS investigations on these materials. This paper reports the results of these studies.

## II Experimental

The method of preparation of Tl_A__{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and Tl(_A_)_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} (_A_ = Ba, Sr) with various values of x has been described elsewhere,[7] except that the sintering temperature for Tl-1:2:1:2 was 900 degC. All the samples were annealed in oxygen after presintering. Phase purity of the samples was checked by powder x-ray-diffraction (XRD) with a JEOL 8030 x-ray diffractometer using Cu _K_\alpha radiation (within the resolution of the instrument, typically a few percent). The superconducting property was studied by dc-electrical resistance measurements. The valence state of thallium was studied by x-ray core-level photoelectron spectroscopy measurements under ultrahigh vacuum (\sim 10^{-9} Torr) using a VG Escalab MkII spectrometer equipped with a nonmono-chromatized Mg _K_\alpha x-ray (_h_\nu=1253.6 eV) source. Energy resolution of the instrument was better than 0.7 eV which is relative to metallic silver.[16, 17] Binding-energy (BE) values were obtained from the peak position after subtracting the background linearly. The uncertainty in determining the BE values is +-0.1 eV. Since these samples have well-known surface contamination problems, we have taken maximum care to minimize the effects by scraping the sample thoroughly over the surface with a stainless steel blade _in situ_ under ultrahigh vacuum. Before scraping, these samples showed a high intense C 1s peak at BE = 289 eV and a double-peak structure for O 1s with BE in the range 528-532 eV. After scraping the surface of the material thoroughly, no C 1s peak was observed and only one O 1s peak was observed at 528.7 eV showing the absence of carbonate impurities. The Tl 4f core-level spectra were recorded after scrapping. Silver paint was used to minimize the charging. However, the metallic samples did not show any charging.

In order to measure the BE of instrumental C 1s, in the absence of carbonate impurity, the samples were allowed in the vacuum chamber for 2-3 h to accumulate the instrumental carbon over the sample surface. The BE value of the C 1s peak was determined to be 285.0 eV. BE values of the samples are referenced to this value. Tl_{2}O_{3} was used as a standard for Tl^{3+}, while for Tl^{4+} the values of BE was taken from McGuire, Schweitzer, and Carlson.[18]

## III Results and Discussion

TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} (0.0 \leq x \leq 1.0)

#### Structure and superconductivity

XRD patterns of TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} showed that the samples with 0.2 \leq x \leq 1.0 and 0.6 \leq x \leq 1.0, respectively, are single phase. The spectra of Ba-containing samples, however, indicated the presence of traces of BaCO_{3} impurity which basically are confined to the surface of the sample. Our XPS spectra (as discussed in experimental) do suggest that BaCO_{3} is present only at the surface of the material. All the other diffraction lines could be indexed on the basis of tetragonal 1:2:0:1 phase, (space group P4/_mmm_). The lattice parameters a and c, obtained from least-square fitting procedure, in both TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} are plotted as a function of x in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. While discussing the variation of a with La^{3+} concentration in Tl_A__{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} (_A_ = Ba,Sr) one should consider the following two competing effects. (i) _Ionic size effect_, the effect due to different sizes of the ions involved: On substituting bigger _A_^{2+} ions (the radii of Ba^{2+} and Sr^{2+} ions are \sim1.47 and \sim 1.31 A, respectively, for ninefold coordination) by smaller La^{3+} ions (radius \sim 1.21 A for ninefold coordination[19]), one expects a decrease in both a and c. (ii) _Valence effect_, the effect due to the difference in the valence of the ions: Since the Cu-O bonds have antibonding character in the CuO_{2} layer (d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} bands[20]), substitution of divalent Ba(Sr) ions by trivalent La^{3+} ions introduces an extra electron, which is accommodated in the CuO_{2} layers, thereby reducing the Cu valence. This should result in an increase in the in-plane bond length r_{\text{Cu-O}}. This effect increases primarily a because, in general, the inplane r_{\text{Cu-O}} in single- and double-Tl-O-layered compounds is close to one-half of the lattice parameter a.

Figure 2: Variation of lattice parameters a (▲) and c (○) with x in TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5}. Both the lattice parameters decrease with increase of x. This is consistent with the ionic size effect (see text).

  In the case of A = Ba, the _ionic size effect_ is more important because of the large differences in the sizes of the ions involved. In the case of A = Sr, the _valence effect_ outweighs the first effect, resulting in a slight increase of a.

Electrical resistance measurements show that the materials TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 and TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 superconduct for x in the range 0.4 <= x <= 0.9 and 0.8 <= x <= 1.0, respectively. Superconducting transition temperature T_{c} in the system TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 is plotted as a function of x in Fig. 4. Samples with x = 0.2 in TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 and x = 0.6 in TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 show metallic behavior and a broad drop in resistance, but did not reach a zero resistance state down to 12 K. This implies that the materials are overdoped with holes. From Fig. 4, it is clear that the variation of T_{c} with x in TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 is similar to what has been observed in other high-_T__c_ materials, for example in La2-_x_Sr_x_CuO_4.21 Materials in the range 0.2 <= x < 0.7 and 0.7 < x <= 0.9 are, respectively, overdoped and underdoped with holes. It is important to note that in the case of TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5, only samples with x = 0.8 and 1.0 superconduct with T_{c} = 27 and 32 K, respectively. Metallic behavior of resistance with temperature and variation of T_{c} with x show that the system TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 with 0.6 <= x < 1.0 is in the overdoped state.

_XPS of Tl 4f7/2 core level in TlBa2-_x_La_CuO_5 and TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 (_x_ = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0)

The XPS of Tl 4f7/2 core-level BE in Tl2O3 is 117.7 eV which is consistent with the reported value.16 The BE of the Tl 4f7/2 core level is 117.7 eV for x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 in TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5. This value is in good agreement with the value of 117.7 eV for Tl 4f7/2 in Tl2O3. This suggests that the valence state of Tl in superconducting TlBa2-_x_La_CuO_5 (_x_ = 0.6 and 0.8) and nonsuperconducting TlBa2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 (_x_ = 1.0) is + 3. This implies that the Tl 6s band lies above the Fermi level and thus does not remove electrons from the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band. Thus the holes are generated owing to the excess oxygen only. These results provide support to the calculations of electronic band structure in TlBa2CuO5.1

XPS of Tl 4f7/2 in TlSr2-_x_La_x_CuO_5 (_x_ = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) is shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen from the figure, the BE of the Tl 4f7/2 core level in these compounds has moved up (BE = 118.3, 118.2, and 118.1 eV for x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively) suggesting that, the valence state of Tl is between +3 and +1 as the near-neighbor environment of Tl ions remains essentially the same in these materials. Decrease of BE with an increase of the concentration of La3+ ions is consistent with the fact that the addition of an extra electron, contributed by lanthanum ion, into the band of the antibonding Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 orbitals could result in a decrease of effective overlap of the Tl 6s band with the Cu 3_d_x_2-_y_2 band and hence the decrease in electron density in the Tl 6s band. From the chemical bonding considerations, addition of electrons into the antibonding band increases in the-plane Cu-O bond length _r_CuO. This is clearly reflected in the lattice parameter a which increases with the increase of concentration of La3+ ions. This situation is to be contrasted with that in the system TlBa1-_x_Sr_x_La_CuO_5.7 In this system, an increase of BE and T_{c} with the increase of iso-valent Sr2+ ion concentration reveals that this system moves from being underdoped (_x_ > 0.4) to being optimally doped.

  a trace of BaCuO_{2} impurity phase for x = 0.3. Single-phase samples could be obtained for 0.4 <= x <= 1.0 in TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} except the presence of traces of an impurity for x = 0.4. Lattice parameters for both systems are listed in Table 1. It should be noted that in both systems, lattice parameter a increases, whereas parameter c decreases, with increase of x. This is because, the variation of the a parameter is primarily due to the _valence effect_ (mentioned above) and the decrease of the c parameter is due to the substitution of bigger Ca^{2+} ions by smaller Gd^{3+} ions, the _ionic size effect_. Resistance measurement show that the compound TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7}, x = 0.3, superconductors with T_{c} = 78 K. The compound with x = 1.0 is a semiconductor. In the case of the system TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} the compounds with x = 0.4 and 0.6 superconduct with T_{c} = 65 and 60 K, respectively. Compounds with x = 0.8 do not superconduct down to 12 K and x = 1.0 is a semiconductor just as TlBa_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7}.

_XPS of Tl 4/7/2 core level in TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} (_x_ = 0.3 _and 1.0) and TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} (_x_ = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0)_

The BE of the Tl 4/7/2 core level in TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} with x = 0.3 and 1.0 is listed in Table 1. The BE of Tl 4/7/2 in superconducting TlBa_{2}Ca_{0.7}Gd_{0.3}Cu_{2}O_{7} and nonsuperconducting TlBa_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7} is 117.7 eV. This value implies that the valence state of Tl in these compounds is + 3, in agreement with electronic band-structure calculations and high-energy spectroscopic studies.1,2 The BE of Tl 4/7/2 in TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} is also listed in Table 1. The BE of Tl 4/7/2 in samples with x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively is 118.3, 118.2, and 118.1 eV suggesting that the valence of Tl is systematically moving towards +3. This suggests that the system TlSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7}, just like TlSr_{2}CuO_{5}, has more Cu^{3+} content because of the holes generated due to overlap of Tl 6s band with Cu 3d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} band in addition to those generated due to excess oxygen. Decrease of BE and T_{c} with x suggests that the system TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} with x (> 0.4) moves towards being underdoped. In this respect, this material is different from the system TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5}, although the BE values are similar and vary in a similar fashion. TlSrLaCuO_{5} with a BE of 118.1 eV is a superconductor, whereas TlSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{7} with the same BE is not a superconductor. This is because in the system TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7}, holes which are generated by the redox mechanism are divided between two CuO_{2} layers whereas in TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} the holes belong to only one CuO_{2} layer. In TlSr-1:2:0:1 and TlSr-1:2:1:2 systems the redox mechanism becomes effective because of relatively smaller lattice parameter compared with, respectively, isostructural TlBa-1:2:0:1 and TlBa-1:2:1:2 materials. In the case of Tl-2 compounds it is due to the higher number (eight) of Tl-T1 nearest-neighbor interaction, as mentioned above, compared to single-Tl-O-layered compounds where there are only four Tl-T1 nearest neighbors.

## IV Conclusion

The XPS of Tl 4/7/2 in single-Tl-O-layered TlSr_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlSr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} show that the valence state of Tl is between +3 and +1, implying that holes are generated due to the redox mechanism also in addition to the holes being generated due to excess oxygen. Our measurement on the isostructural TlBa_{2-x}La_{x}CuO_{5} and TlBa_{2}Ca_{1-x}Gd_{x}Cu_{2}O_{7} systems show that the Tl valence is essentially +3. Thus elec

  trons are not transferred from CuO_{2} layers into the Tl 6s band in these two systems. Smaller values of lattice parameters in TlSr-1:2:0:1 and TlSr-1:2:1:2 compared to that in TlBa-1:2:0:1 and TlBa-1:2:1:2 are responsible for the presence of the redox mechanism of hole generation.
