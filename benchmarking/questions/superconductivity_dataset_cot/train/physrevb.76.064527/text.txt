25 May 200720 ing, the superconducting transition inspected by the ac susceptibility occurs at about 5 K with a relatively wide transition. However, after the second step, the transition moves to about 5.7 K with a sharper transition width if we did not add extra Mg in the second step. The Ta foil seems unreacted with the materials in both steps of the fabrication if the Mg content is below 12 in the stoichiometric formula.

In the top frame of Fig. 2 we show the temperature dependence of resistivity under different magnetic fields. One can see that the transition width determined from resistive measurements (1% -99 % _p_n) is only about 0.2 K. This is consistent with the rather sharp magnetic transition as revealed by the ac susceptibility data shown in the bottom view of Fig. 2. By applying a magnetic field the transition shifts to lower temperatures quickly with a slope \(-d\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)/dT\big{|}_{T_{c}} = 0.63\) T/K for the present sample with \(T_{c} = 5.7\) K. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg relation [10]\(\mu_{0}H_{c2} = - 0.69d\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)/dT\big{|}_{T_{c}}T_{c}\), we get the upper critical field \(\mu_{0}H_{c2} = 2.48\) T. The value found here is comparable to that reported in the earlier paper [9] (\(T_{c} = 5\) K). It is interesting to note that the value of the slope \(-d\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)/dT\) correlates strongly with \(T_{c}\). For a sample with \(T_{c} = 3.7\) K, we found that \(-d\mu_{0}H_{c2}(T)/dT\big{|}_{T_{c}} \approx 0.2\) T/K. This suggests that there is a tunability of superconducting properties in this system which will be addressed in Sec. IV.

## III Specific heat and fit to the BCS model

Shown in Fig. 3 are the raw data of the specific heat up to a magnetic field of 1 T. The open symbols represent the data taken with the DR, while all filled symbols show the data taken with the PPMS. Both sets of data coincide very well for different fields. With increasing the magnetic field the specific heat jump due to the superconducting transition moves quickly to lower temperatures leaving a background which is consistent with that above \(T_{c}\) at zero field. This provides a reliable way to extract the normal state specific heat as shown by the thick solid line since the normal state can be described by \(C/T = \gamma_{n} + \beta T^{2}\), where the first and the second term correspond to the normal state electronic and phonon contribution, respectively. From the data it is found that \(\beta = 5.4\) mJ/mol K\({}^{4}\) and \(\gamma_{n} = 57.7\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\). By extrapolating the data in the superconducting state at zero field down to 0 K one finds, however, a residual value \(\gamma_{0}\)\(= 13.8\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), indicating a contribution either by a nonsuperconducting fraction in volume of about 24%, or by the DOS induced by the impurity scattering for a nodal gap which will be discussed later. The residual \(\gamma_{0}\) may be induced by the nonsuperconducting region, but it is still difficult to be regarded as due to an impurity phase with completely different structure as MgIrB since the XRD data shown in Fig. 1 is quite clean. We thus suggest that the superconductivity depends sensitively on the relative compositions among the three elements and some regions without

The open symbols show the data taken with the DR. The thick solid line represents the normal state specific heat which contains both the phonon and the electronic contributions.

It is clear that the dc magnetic field makes the transition shift parallel to low temperatures, manifesting a field-induced pair-breaking effect. The inset in the top panel shows the resistive transition in a wide temperature regime at \(\mu_{0}H = 0\) T.

  superconductivity have the chemical composition and even the structure close to the superconducting phase. In any case, it is safe to conclude that the normal state Sommerfeld constant for the present sample is close to or slightly above 43.9 mJ/mol K2.

Next we can have an estimation on the electron-phonon coupling strength based on g_n_. In MgIrB, the electronic conduction is dominated by the 5d band electrons of Ir atoms. The DOS at \(E_{F}\) given by the local-density approximation band-structure calculation [11] is about _N_(\(E_{F}\)) = 5.51/eV spin. By assuming that there is an electron-phonon coupling constant l_e_-ph in the system, one has

\[\gamma_{n} = \frac{2\pi^{2}}{3}N(E_{F})k_{B}^{2}(1 + \lambda_{e\text{-ph}}).\]

Using the band-structure value of _N_(\(F_{F}\)), we have g_n_ = 25.98(1 + l_e_-ph)(mJ/mol K2). Taking the experimental value g_n_ = 43.9 mJ/mol K2, we obtain l_e_-ph = 0.68, indicating a slightly moderate electron-phonon coupling.

In the raw data shown in Fig. 3, one can see an upturn of g=_C/T_ in the very low-temperature region. This upturn is known as the Schottky anomaly, induced by lifting the degeneracy of the states of the paramagnetic spins. We tried a two level (_S_ = 1/2) model to fit the low-temperature data but found a poor fitting together with an extremely large Lande factor g in the Zeeman energy _g__m__p_Heff, where \(m_{B}\) is the Bohr magneton, _H_eff = \(\sqrt{H^{2} + H_{0}^{2}}\) is the effective magnetic field which evolves into _H_eff = \(H\)0, the crystal field at zero external field. In MgIrB the most possible paramagnetic centers may be from Ir4+(_S_ = 5/2) or Ir3+(_S_ = 2). The system energy due to Zeeman splitting in a magnetic field is [12]

\[E_{\text{Sch}} = \sum E_{i}\exp( - E_{i}/k_{B}T)/\sum\exp( - E_{i}/k_{B}T),\]

where \(E_{i}\) = _M__J__S_ _m__B_Heff and \(M_{J}\) = -_S_, -_S_ + 1, ..., \(S\) - 1, \(S\). The specific heat due to the Schottky effect is thus _C_Sch = (_n_/_k_B)_dE_Sch/_dT_, where \(n\) represents the concentration of the paramagnetic centers. For \(S\) = 5/2 and \(S\) = 2 the calculated results are very close to each other, therefore we show only the fit with \(S\) = 5/2 corresponding to Ir4+ (six levels). This method allows us to deal with the data at zero and finite fields simultaneously. It is known that the Schottky term should be zero at \(T\) = 0 K. In the superconducting state, the total specific heat can be written as _C_tot = _C_nonis + _C_e + _C_ph + _C_Sch with _C_nonis = g_0\(T\) as the contribution of the nonsuperconducting regions, \(C_{e}\) is the electronic part. In the zero temperature limit only the contribution of the nonsuperconducting part is left. Applying a magnetic field gives rise to a finite value D_g_e to \(C_{e}\) = _g__T_e due to the presence of vortices. Practically, in order to fit the Schottky term, we first remove the phonon contribution _C_ph = _gT_3, then vertically move the experimental data downward with a magnitude g0=13.8 mJ/mol K2 and a field-induced vortex term D_g_(_H_). In Fig. 4(a) we present the specific heat coefficient \(g_{e}\) - \(g_{n}\) measured at the magnetic fields up to 1 T. An upturn due to the Schottky effect is visible in the low-temperature region for all fields. In Fig. 4(b) we show the data at _m__0\(H\) = 0 T before [(red) filled circles] and after (dark open squares) removing the Schottky anomaly calculated based on the model of six levels with \(m\)0_H_0 = 0.25 T, \(n\) = 3.74 mJ/mol K, and \(g\) = 2. Note that we used the value 43.9 mJ/mol K2 as the normal state Sommerfeld constant g_n_. One can see that the low-temperature part after removing the Schottky anomaly is flattened out below about 0.8 K when the field is zero. Furthermore, it can also be justified by the requirement of entropy conservation. Since the Schottky term gives only a very small contribution in the high-temperature region (above 1.5 K here), if \(g_{e}\) had a power law as required by a nodal gap, instead of a flat temperature dependence for an _s_-wave gap, the entropy would be clearly not conserved yielding a large negative entropy. This is of course unreasonable. In Fig. 4(b) we present together the theoretical curves for \(g_{e}\) - \(g_{n}\) calculated using the weak coupling BCS formula

\[\gamma_{e} = \frac{4N(0)}{k_{B}T^{3}}\int_{0}^{k_{B}}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{e^{ \beta k_{B}T}}{(1 + e^{\beta k_{B}T})^{2}}\] (3) \[\times \left( \varepsilon^{2} + \Delta^{2}(\theta,T) - \frac{T\,d\Delta^{2}(\theta,T)}{dT} \right)d\theta d\varepsilon,\]

where \(\zeta = \sqrt{e^{2} + \Delta^{2}(T,\theta)}\). In obtaining the theoretical fit we take the implicit relation D0(_T_) derived from the weak coupling BCS theory for superconductors with different pairing symmetries: D(_T_, _th_)=D0(_T_) for \(s\) wave, D(_T_, _th_) = D0(_T_)cos 2_th_ for \(d\) wave, and D(_T_, _th_)=D0(_T_)cos _th_ for \(p\) wave, respectively. The theoretical curve of the \(s\) wave fits the experimental data very well leading to an isotropic gap value D0=0.94 meV and \(T_{c}\) = 5.7 K. The ratio D0/_k_B_T_c

The dark solid, red dashed, and dotted green lines in (b) are the theoretical curves calculated based on the BCS model (see text) with a gap of \(s\) wave, \(d\) wave, and \(p\) wave, respectively.

  =1.91 obtained here is quite close to the prediction for the weak coupling limit (\(\Delta_{0}/k_{B}T_{c}\)=1.76), indicating a slightly moderate coupling strength. This is self-consistent with the conclusion derived from the estimation on \(\gamma_{n}\). In addition, the specific heat anomaly at \(T_{c}\) is \(\Delta C_{e}/\gamma_{n}T|_{T_{c}}\) = 1.64 being close to the theoretical value 1.43 predicted for the case of weak coupling, again showing a slightly moderate coupling. The inset in Fig. 4(b) shows a field induced part \(\Delta\gamma_{e}\). In an \(s\)-wave superconductor \(\Delta\gamma_{e}\) is mainly contributed by the vortex cores and a linear relation \(\Delta\gamma_{e}\) \(\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  changeable in a wide regime (from 2 K to 5.7 K) in MgIrB with a rather sharp transition width. This is actually a rare case in the alloy superconductors in which the off-stoichiometric elements normally play as the scatterers and break the Cooper pairs and finally make the transition broad. In MgIrB a slight off-stoichiometry may not change the structure, but promote the mutual-substitution leading to a different electron-phonon coupling strength. In Fig. 6 we show the temperature dependence of the resistivity and the ac susceptibility of another sample (\(T_{c}\) = 3.7 K) which was made also in two steps but with 20% more Mg added in the second step. One can see that the transition width at zero field is still quite narrow and the x-ray diffraction pattern taken on this sample is reasonably clean (not shown here). An estimation on the electron-phonon coupling strength \(\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}\) based on the McMillan equation on this sample tells that \(\lambda_{c\text{-ph}}\) = 0.55. In Fig. 7 we present the upper critical field \(H_{c2}(T)\) taken with the criterion 10% \(\rho_{n}\) for the two selected samples with \(T_{c}\) = 5.7 K and \(T_{c}\) = 3.7 K. One can see that the slope \(-d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}\) is very different between these two samples. Actually in the previous work of the Princeton group, [9]\(-d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}\) can be as high as 1 T/K. In a dirty type-II superconductor, it was predicted [18] that \(-d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}\)\(\propto\)\(\rho_{n}\gamma_{n}\eta\) with \(\eta\) in connection with the electron-phonon coupling strength. It is thus reasonable to ascribe the variation of \(d\mu_{0}H_{c2}/dT|_{T_{c}}\) and \(T_{c}\) to different electron-phonon coupling strengths and different density of states at \(E_{F}\). All these quantities may be optimized in future work and hopefully will lead to a higher superconducting transition temperature. The basic parameters and properties derived in this work provide a playground for the future study in this interesting system.

## V V. Concluding remarks

In summary, analysis on the low-temperature data in MgIrB finds an \(s\)-wave pairing symmetry with a gap in the weak coupling to slightly moderate coupling regime and the superconductivity is induced by the electron-phonon coupling. The spin-triplet component, if it exists, should remain as a small part of the total condensate. Tuning the superconducting transition temperature seems possible through changing the electron-phonon coupling strength and the density of states at the Fermi level by varying the relative compositions among the three elements and probably also by mutual substitution.
