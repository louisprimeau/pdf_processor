###### Abstract

Normal and superconducting states of BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystals (T_{\rm C}\sim 2.4 K) have been studied. Anisotropy of resistivity is comparable with that of upper critical fields, indicating the effective mass estimated in the normal state is nearly the same as that in the superconducting state. From magnetization hysteresis with a weak vortex pinning, lower critical fields are estimated. Hall effect is explained by a two-carrier model consistent with a multiple-band with both hole and electron characters. It has been proved that BaNi_{2}P_{2} is an anisotropic three-dimensional intermetallic superconductor.

Recently, a new class of high-temperature superconductivity has been discovered in the iron-arsenide layered compounds with the ZrCuSiAs structure, i.e., oxypnictides, LaFeAs(O_{1-x}F), [12] and those with the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure, Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2-x}As_{2-x}. [3] In the fluorine-free and oxygen-deficient compound, NdFeAsO_{1-y} (0.3 \leq y \leq 0.8), the critical temperature, T_{\rm C} becomes as high as 53 K. [4] Besides these iron-arsenide compounds, pioneering superconductors have earlier been found, although the critical temperatures are lower. [5, 6, 7, 8] As described in Ref. [8], a superconducting transition occurs in the nickel-based phosphide, BaNi_{2}P_{2} (T_{\rm C}\sim 3 K), the crystal structure of which is the same as BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the parent compound for high-temperature superconductivity. Similarly to cuprates, the newly discovered iron- or nickel-based superconductors have two-dimensional crystal structures, and the carrier is doped from the adjacent layers. Calculated band structures of LaOFeAs and LaOFeP, [9] on the other hand, indicate that the Fermi level is crossed by five bands with mainly Fe character, which is different from a single band feature in cuprates. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, as described in Ref. [10], the Fermi surface is similar to that of LaOFeAs.

In this Brief Report, we report the normal and superconducting states of BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystals prepared by the high-pressure synthesis method using the cubic-anvil-type apparatus (Riken CAP-07). [4] The dimensions of the crystals used for the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity measurements are about 0.50 \times 0.13 \times 0.013 mm^{3} and 0.63 \times 0.56 \times 0.025 mm^{3}, respectively, with the shortest edge parallel to the c axis. For the out-of-plane resistivity, the current electrodes on both surfaces of the crystal are drawn in a shape of annular ring with use of gold paste. The voltage electrodes are at the center of the ring. [11] Resistivity in magnetic fields has been measured in a cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet. For Hall-effect measurement, the gold wires are attached to a crystal through the electrodes made by gold paste, and the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane with the current in plane. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization has been measured by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design Inc.). After the crystal is cooled down to the lowest temperature (1.76 K) in zero field, the magnetic field is applied, and the ZFC magnetization is measured with increasing temperature. Subsequently, the FC magnetization is measured with decreasing temperature in a same magnetic field.

Figure 1 shows temperature profiles of the in-plane, \rho_{\rm l}, and out-of-plane, \rho_{\perp}, resistivities of the BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystals, respectively. The value of \rho_{\rm l} (\rho_{\perp}) at 300 K is about 80(500) \mu\Omega cm, and as shown in the inset, the residual resistivity is 4.15(14.4) \mu\Omega cm, which leads to that the residual resistivity ratio [\rho(300 K)/\rho(3 K)] is 18.7 (34.3) for in plane (out of plane). The anisotropy of resistivity, \rho_{\perp}/\rho_{\rm l} is weakly dependent on temperature, and it is \sim6.3 at 300 K much smaller than that reported for the nondepar-sneide compounds, AFe_{2}As_{2} (A= Ba, Sr, and Ca). [12, 13, 14] For T\leq 25 K \rho_{\rm l} is empirically fitted by \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n} with \rho_{0} =4.15 \mu\Omega cm, A=7.78 \times 10^{-8}\mu\Omega cm K^{-n}, and n=5. As shown in this figure, temperature dependence of both in-plane and out-of-plane resistivities seems to cross over from linear at high temperatures to power law, T^{n} at low temperatures. A detailed analysis will be published in Ref. [15]. As

  temperature decreases, a superconducting state becomes prevailing. The critical temperature as a midpoint of the transition is 2.51 and 2.31 K for in plane and out of plane, respectively. Although from Fig. 1 the anisotropy ratio is weakly dependent on temperature, the scattering mechanism seems to be nearly common for both directions, and the anisotropy seems to originate from anisotropic mass (\rho_{\perp}/\rho_{\rm{l}}\!\sim\!m_{\perp}^{*}/m_{\rm{l}}^{*}). Figure 1 indicates that a rather usual electron-phonon scattering seems to be dominant for the resistivity of the BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystal.

Figure 2 shows the magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity, \rho_{xy} of a BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystal taken at several temperatures. In Fig. 2, nearly linear dependence of \rho_{xy} on magnetic fields is seen at high temperatures, while nonlinear behavior is seen at low temperatures (T\!\!<\!50 K). Temperature variations in R_{H} determined from d\rho_{xy}/{\rm{d}}H at H\!\!=\!\!0 are indicated in the inset. The R_{H} estimated is negative in the magnitude of 10^{-4}  cm^{3}/C, and the carrier numbers, n is estimated to be in the magnitude of 10^{22}  cm^{-3} from a relation that R_{H}\!\!=\!\!-1/(en), which is equivalent to 3-5 electrons per a formula unit of BaNi_{2}P_{2}.

A multiple Fermi surface with electron and hole characters could partly cancel out the Hall effect. As described in Ref. [16], two electron surfaces and two hole ones are found by de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation, and their carrier numbers are listed in Table 1. In a two-carrier model, Hall resistivity is expressed by an equation that [17]

\[\begin{array}{l}\rho_{xy}=-(1/e)H[n_{e}\mu_{\rm{e}}^{2}-n_{\rm{h}}\mu_{\rm{h }}^{2}+(n_{\rm{e}}-n_{\rm{h}})\\ \times\mu_{\rm{e}}^{2}\mu_{\rm{h}}^{2}H^{2}][(n_{\rm{e}}\mu_{\rm{e}}+n_{\rm{h}} \mu_{\rm{h}})^{2}+(n_{\rm{e}}-n_{\rm{h}})^{2}\mu_{\rm{e}}^{2}\mu_{\rm{h}}^{2}H ^{2}]\end{array}\] (1)

where n_{\rm{e}} and \mu_{\rm{e}} (n_{\rm{h}} and \  from Eq. (1) with n_{\rm e}(n_{\rm h}) = 6.52 x 1021(3.90 x 1020) cm-3, and \mu_{\rm e} (\mu_{\rm h}) = 189(688) cm2 V-1 s-1 [n_{\rm h}/n_{\rm e} = 0.060 and \mu_{\rm h}/\mu_{\rm e} =3.65], which are obtained by fitting \rho_{xy} at 5 K. The estimated n_{\rm h} is comparable with that of band 25 in Ref. [16].

We have also measured the magnetoresistance (MR), [\rho_{\rm i}(H)\!-\!\rho_{\rm i}(0)]/\rho_{\rm i}(0) at 5 K for magnetic field perpendicular to the plane (H\bot plane) and the transport current in plane. It has been indicated that the MR is positive and almost linearly dependent on H^{2}, the magnitude of which is comparable with the value expected from the parameters obtained from the field-dependent Hall resistivity. The detail of the analysis is published in Ref. [15]. Figure 2 thus indicates that transport properties of BaNi_{2}P_{2} are composed of not only electrons but also holes with smaller carrier numbers and higher mobility, being consistent with the results described in Ref. [16].

In Fig. 3, are shown temperature variations of the magnetization hysteresis (M-H curves) for magnetic field parallel (H\| plane) (a) and perpendicular to the plane (H\bot plane) (b), respectively. The inset of Fig. 3(a) indicates the ZFC and FC magnetization for H\| plane taken at 10 Oe. In the inset, the magnitude of the ZFC magnetization at the lowest temperature exceeds perfect diamagnetism (dashed line) due to a demagnetizing effect,[18] and that of the FC magnetization reaches about 56%, the values of which are enough for bulk superconductivity.

As shown in the M-H curves for both H\| and \bot plane, the discrepancies between the field-increasing and decreasing processes are not pronounced, indicating a rather weak vortex pinning. In the present study, the lower critical field, H_{\rm c1} is approximated from the penetration field, H_{\rm p} at which an extrapolation of perfect diamagnetism, M\!=\!-\!H/\{4\pi(1\!-\!N)\} (N being demagnetizing factors[18]) meets a level of the minimum magnetization,[19] as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b), although it might overestimate lower critical field. The demagnetizing factor is 0.11 (0.7) for H\| plane (H\| plane), which is estimated from the initial magnetization vs H at H\!\ll\!H_{\rm P}. From a relation that H_{\rm c1}\!=\!H_{\rm p}/(1\!-\!N),[19] the lower critical field is estimated at 52 (82) Oe for H\| plane (H\bot plane) at T=2 K, which are comparable with the results in the earlier work.[8]

Figure 4 shows temperature profiles of \rho_{\rm i} normalized at 5 K for H\| plane (a) and \bot plane (b) of the same crystal used for the measurement of in-plane resistivity in Fig. 1. In Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), the transport current is perpendicular to field (H\botI). In these figures, a broadening of the resistive transition with increase in field is not pronounced, and the transition temperature, T_{\rm C}(H) may be defined as the midpoint of the resistive transition. A state with finite resistivity at T =1.6 K for H\| plane (\bot plane) starts to be seen at H\!\cong\!600 (300) Oe. A rather usual resistive transition without broadening as shown in these figures is also seen in Sr_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} with small anisotropy of resistivity[13] although both T_{\rm C} and critical fields of Sr_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} are much higher than those of BaNi_{2}P_{2}.

In Fig. 4(c), with use of the field dependence of T_{\rm C}(H) as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), are indicated the upper critical field for H\| plane, H_{\rm c2}^{\bot} and that for H\bot plane, H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}. In Fig. 4(c), the lower critical fields for both directions are also indicated. From the relation that H_{\rm c2}(0) =0.69[H_{\rm c2}(7)/{\rm d}T]_{\rm TM\cap}T_{\rm C},[20]H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0) (H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0)) is estimated about 1410 (650) Oe. From the equation that H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0) (H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0)) = \phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{\rm i}^{2}) (\phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{\rm i}^{2}\xi_{\rm i})), furthermore, the in-plane (out-of-plane) coherence length \xi_{\rm i} (\xi_{\bot}) is estimated about 710(330) A. The ratio, H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0)/H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0) (=(m_{\bot}^{*}/m_{\rm p}^{*})^{1/2}) is about 2.2, which is comparable with that of resistivity, (\rho_{\bot}/\rho_{\rm i})^{1/2}\!\sim\!2.5. These results indicate that BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystal is a rather conventional type II superconductor with three-dimensional nature.

Band calculation of BaNi_{2}P_{2} shows that multiple bands cross the Fermi level and dispersion exists both along in-plane and out-of-plane directions.[21] Although there is at present no publication on the Fermi surface of the compound, we may expect similar Fermi surface as that of BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [10]) that has more dispersion along the out-of-plane direction than that of LaOFeAs.[10] Therefore, three-dimensional nature of BaNi_{2}P_{2} may be a natural consequence.

In summary, we have studied the normal and superconducting states of BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystals prepared by the

  high-pressure synthesis method. Temperature dependence of resistivity is nearly the same both for the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, and the ratio of effective mass, (m_{\rm r}^{\perp}/m_{\rm r}^{\perp})^{1/2} estimated from the anisotropy of resistivity is \sim2.5. The negative Hall coefficient in the magnitude of 10^{-4} cm^{3}/C and the nonlinear field dependence of Hall resistivity at low temperatures are explained by a two-carrier model. _M-H_ curves in the superconducting state show small hysteresis, characteristic for a weak vortex pinning, and the lower critical fields are estimated. From the resistive transition in magnetic fields, the upper critical field is estimated as H_{\rm c2}^{\parallel}(0) (H_{\rm c2}^{\perp}(0)) \sim 1410(650) Oe for H parallel (perpendicular) to the plane. The in-plane (out-of-plane) coherence length is \xi_{\rm l} (\xi_{\perp}) \sim 710(330) A. The ratio of effective mass from the upper critical fields is about 2.2, which is comparable to that obtained in the normal state. It has been proved in present study that the BaNi_{2}P_{2} compound is a three-dimensional anisotropic superconductor, which may be in contrast to superconductivity with higher T_{\rm C} of the hole-doped AFe_{2}As_{2} (_A_ = Ba, Sr, and Ca) with the same crystal structure.

Recently, a new class of high-temperature superconductivity has been discovered in the iron-arsenide layered compounds with the ZrCuSiAs structure, i.e., oxypnictides, LaFeAs(O_{1-x}F), [12] and those with the ThCr_{2}Si_{2} structure, Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2-x}As_{2-x}. [3] In the fluorine-free and oxygen-deficient compound, NdFeAsO_{1-y} (0.3 \leq y \leq 0.8), the critical temperature, T_{\rm C} becomes as high as 53 K. [4] Besides these iron-arsenide compounds, pioneering superconductors have earlier been found, although the critical temperatures are lower. [5, 6, 7, 8] As described in Ref. [8], a superconducting transition occurs in the nickel-based phosphide, BaNi_{2}P_{2} (T_{\rm C}\sim 3 K), the crystal structure of which is the same as BaFe_{2}As_{2}, the parent compound for high-temperature superconductivity. Similarly to cuprates, the newly discovered iron- or nickel-based superconductors have two-dimensional crystal structures, and the carrier is doped from the adjacent layers. Calculated band structures of LaOFeAs and LaOFeP, [9] on the other hand, indicate that the Fermi level is crossed by five bands with mainly Fe character, which is different from a single band feature in cuprates. For BaFe_{2}As_{2}, as described in Ref. [10], the Fermi surface is similar to that of LaOFeAs.

In this Brief Report, we report the normal and superconducting states of BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystals prepared by the high-pressure synthesis method using the cubic-anvil-type apparatus (Riken CAP-07). [4] The dimensions of the crystals used for the in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity measurements are about 0.50 \times 0.13 \times 0.013 mm^{3} and 0.63 \times 0.56 \times 0.025 mm^{3}, respectively, with the shortest edge parallel to the c axis. For the out-of-plane resistivity, the current electrodes on both surfaces of the crystal are drawn in a shape of annular ring with use of gold paste. The voltage electrodes are at the center of the ring. [11] Resistivity in magnetic fields has been measured in a cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet. For Hall-effect measurement, the gold wires are attached to a crystal through the electrodes made by gold paste, and the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane with the current in plane. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetization has been measured by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design Inc.). After the crystal is cooled down to the lowest temperature (1.76 K) in zero field, the magnetic field is applied, and the ZFC magnetization is measured with increasing temperature. Subsequently, the FC magnetization is measured with decreasing temperature in a same magnetic field.

Figure 1 shows temperature profiles of the in-plane, \rho_{\rm l}, and out-of-plane, \rho_{\perp}, resistivities of the BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystals, respectively. The value of \rho_{\rm l} (\rho_{\perp}) at 300 K is about 80(500) \mu\Omega cm, and as shown in the inset, the residual resistivity is 4.15(14.4) \mu\Omega cm, which leads to that the residual resistivity ratio [\rho(300 K)/\rho(3 K)] is 18.7 (34.3) for in plane (out of plane). The anisotropy of resistivity, \rho_{\perp}/\rho_{\rm l} is weakly dependent on temperature, and it is \sim6.3 at 300 K much smaller than that reported for the nondepar-sneide compounds, AFe_{2}As_{2} (A= Ba, Sr, and Ca). [12, 13, 14] For T\leq 25 K \rho_{\rm l} is empirically fitted by \rho=\rho_{0}+AT^{n} with \rho_{0} =4.15 \mu\Omega cm, A=7.78 \times 10^{-8}\mu\Omega cm K^{-n}, and n=5. As shown in this figure, temperature dependence of both in-plane and out-of-plane resistivities seems to cross over from linear at high temperatures to power law, T^{n} at low temperatures. A detailed analysis will be published in Ref. [15]. As

  temperature decreases, a superconducting state becomes prevailing. The critical temperature as a midpoint of the transition is 2.51 and 2.31 K for in plane and out of plane, respectively. Although from Fig. 1 the anisotropy ratio is weakly dependent on temperature, the scattering mechanism seems to be nearly common for both directions, and the anisotropy seems to originate from anisotropic mass (\rho_{\perp}/\rho_{\rm{l}}\!\sim\!m_{\perp}^{*}/m_{\rm{l}}^{*}). Figure 1 indicates that a rather usual electron-phonon scattering seems to be dominant for the resistivity of the BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystal.

Figure 2 shows the magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity, \rho_{xy} of a BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystal taken at several temperatures. In Fig. 2, nearly linear dependence of \rho_{xy} on magnetic fields is seen at high temperatures, while nonlinear behavior is seen at low temperatures (T\!\!<\!50 K). Temperature variations in R_{H} determined from d\rho_{xy}/{\rm{d}}H at H\!\!=\!\!0 are indicated in the inset. The R_{H} estimated is negative in the magnitude of 10^{-4}  cm^{3}/C, and the carrier numbers, n is estimated to be in the magnitude of 10^{22}  cm^{-3} from a relation that R_{H}\!\!=\!\!-1/(en), which is equivalent to 3-5 electrons per a formula unit of BaNi_{2}P_{2}.

\[\begin{array}{l}\rho_{xy}=-(1/e)H[n_{e}\mu_{\rm{e}}^{2}-n_{\rm{h}}\mu_{\rm{h }}^{2}+(n_{\rm{e}}-n_{\rm{h}})\\ \times\mu_{\rm{e}}^{2}\mu_{\rm{h}}^{2}H^{2}][(n_{\rm{e}}\mu_{\rm{e}}+n_{\rm{h}} \mu_{\rm{h}})^{2}+(n_{\rm{e}}-n_{\rm{h}})^{2}\mu_{\rm{e}}^{2}\mu_{\rm{h}}^{2}H ^{2}]\end{array}\] (1)

where n_{\rm{e}} and \mu_{\rm{e}} (n_{\rm{h}} and \  from Eq. (1) with n_{\rm e}(n_{\rm h}) = 6.52 x 1021(3.90 x 1020) cm-3, and \mu_{\rm e} (\mu_{\rm h}) = 189(688) cm2 V-1 s-1 [n_{\rm h}/n_{\rm e} = 0.060 and \mu_{\rm h}/\mu_{\rm e} =3.65], which are obtained by fitting \rho_{xy} at 5 K. The estimated n_{\rm h} is comparable with that of band 25 in Ref. [16].

We have also measured the magnetoresistance (MR), [\rho_{\rm i}(H)\!-\!\rho_{\rm i}(0)]/\rho_{\rm i}(0) at 5 K for magnetic field perpendicular to the plane (H\bot plane) and the transport current in plane. It has been indicated that the MR is positive and almost linearly dependent on H^{2}, the magnitude of which is comparable with the value expected from the parameters obtained from the field-dependent Hall resistivity. The detail of the analysis is published in Ref. [15]. Figure 2 thus indicates that transport properties of BaNi_{2}P_{2} are composed of not only electrons but also holes with smaller carrier numbers and higher mobility, being consistent with the results described in Ref. [16].

In Fig. 3, are shown temperature variations of the magnetization hysteresis (M-H curves) for magnetic field parallel (H\| plane) (a) and perpendicular to the plane (H\bot plane) (b), respectively. The inset of Fig. 3(a) indicates the ZFC and FC magnetization for H\| plane taken at 10 Oe. In the inset, the magnitude of the ZFC magnetization at the lowest temperature exceeds perfect diamagnetism (dashed line) due to a demagnetizing effect,[18] and that of the FC magnetization reaches about 56%, the values of which are enough for bulk superconductivity.

As shown in the M-H curves for both H\| and \bot plane, the discrepancies between the field-increasing and decreasing processes are not pronounced, indicating a rather weak vortex pinning. In the present study, the lower critical field, H_{\rm c1} is approximated from the penetration field, H_{\rm p} at which an extrapolation of perfect diamagnetism, M\!=\!-\!H/\{4\pi(1\!-\!N)\} (N being demagnetizing factors[18]) meets a level of the minimum magnetization,[19] as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b), although it might overestimate lower critical field. The demagnetizing factor is 0.11 (0.7) for H\| plane (H\| plane), which is estimated from the initial magnetization vs H at H\!\ll\!H_{\rm P}. From a relation that H_{\rm c1}\!=\!H_{\rm p}/(1\!-\!N),[19] the lower critical field is estimated at 52 (82) Oe for H\| plane (H\bot plane) at T=2 K, which are comparable with the results in the earlier work.[8]

Figure 4 shows temperature profiles of \rho_{\rm i} normalized at 5 K for H\| plane (a) and \bot plane (b) of the same crystal used for the measurement of in-plane resistivity in Fig. 1. In Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), the transport current is perpendicular to field (H\botI). In these figures, a broadening of the resistive transition with increase in field is not pronounced, and the transition temperature, T_{\rm C}(H) may be defined as the midpoint of the resistive transition. A state with finite resistivity at T =1.6 K for H\| plane (\bot plane) starts to be seen at H\!\cong\!600 (300) Oe. A rather usual resistive transition without broadening as shown in these figures is also seen in Sr_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} with small anisotropy of resistivity[13] although both T_{\rm C} and critical fields of Sr_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_{2}As_{2} are much higher than those of BaNi_{2}P_{2}.

In Fig. 4(c), with use of the field dependence of T_{\rm C}(H) as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), are indicated the upper critical field for H\| plane, H_{\rm c2}^{\bot} and that for H\bot plane, H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}. In Fig. 4(c), the lower critical fields for both directions are also indicated. From the relation that H_{\rm c2}(0) =0.69[H_{\rm c2}(7)/{\rm d}T]_{\rm TM\cap}T_{\rm C},[20]H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0) (H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0)) is estimated about 1410 (650) Oe. From the equation that H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0) (H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0)) = \phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{\rm i}^{2}) (\phi_{0}/(2\pi\xi_{\rm i}^{2}\xi_{\rm i})), furthermore, the in-plane (out-of-plane) coherence length \xi_{\rm i} (\xi_{\bot}) is estimated about 710(330) A. The ratio, H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0)/H_{\rm c2}^{\bot}(0) (=(m_{\bot}^{*}/m_{\rm p}^{*})^{1/2}) is about 2.2, which is comparable with that of resistivity, (\rho_{\bot}/\rho_{\rm i})^{1/2}\!\sim\!2.5. These results indicate that BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystal is a rather conventional type II superconductor with three-dimensional nature.

Band calculation of BaNi_{2}P_{2} shows that multiple bands cross the Fermi level and dispersion exists both along in-plane and out-of-plane directions.[21] Although there is at present no publication on the Fermi surface of the compound, we may expect similar Fermi surface as that of BaFe_{2}As_{2} (Ref. [10]) that has more dispersion along the out-of-plane direction than that of LaOFeAs.[10] Therefore, three-dimensional nature of BaNi_{2}P_{2} may be a natural consequence.

In summary, we have studied the normal and superconducting states of BaNi_{2}P_{2} single crystals prepared by the

  high-pressure synthesis method. Temperature dependence of resistivity is nearly the same both for the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, and the ratio of effective mass, (m_{\rm r}^{\perp}/m_{\rm r}^{\perp})^{1/2} estimated from the anisotropy of resistivity is \sim2.5. The negative Hall coefficient in the magnitude of 10^{-4} cm^{3}/C and the nonlinear field dependence of Hall resistivity at low temperatures are explained by a two-carrier model. _M-H_ curves in the superconducting state show small hysteresis, characteristic for a weak vortex pinning, and the lower critical fields are estimated. From the resistive transition in magnetic fields, the upper critical field is estimated as H_{\rm c2}^{\parallel}(0) (H_{\rm c2}^{\perp}(0)) \sim 1410(650) Oe for H parallel (perpendicular) to the plane. The in-plane (out-of-plane) coherence length is \xi_{\rm l} (\xi_{\perp}) \sim 710(330) A. The ratio of effective mass from the upper critical fields is about 2.2, which is comparable to that obtained in the normal state. It has been proved in present study that the BaNi_{2}P_{2} compound is a three-dimensional anisotropic superconductor, which may be in contrast to superconductivity with higher T_{\rm C} of the hole-doped AFe_{2}As_{2} (_A_ = Ba, Sr, and Ca) with the same crystal structure.
