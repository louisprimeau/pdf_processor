###### Abstract

A systematic and quantitative study of upper critical fields in alloys with increasing atomic number is carried out. The alloys are prepared by the technique of liquid (splat) quenching. They include the metastable body-centered-cubic (\beta) phase of Ti-Pd, Zr-Mo, Zr-Pd, and Hf-Mo, amorphous phase of Zr-Rh, and the stable \beta phase of Ti-Mo and Ta-Hf. Measurements are made in magnetic fields up to 90 kG and in temperatures down to 0.5 K. The results are analyzed within the framework of the dirty-limit theory of Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki (WHHM). A least-squares fitting routine is performed using _all the data_ (weighted equally) for a given sample. It is emphasized that the visual critical-field gradient near the transition temperature cannot be taken as the actual gradient in the presence of Pauli paramagnetic limitation. The main findings are the following: (i) Even without including renormalization corrections due to electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions, very good fits to the WHHM theory are obtained; (ii) critical-field data for all our samples (with minor exceptions in Hf-Mo) are found to fall below or on the Maki curve (i.e., when the spin-orbit scattering parameter \lambda_{\text{n.o.}} goes to infinity); (iii) values of \lambda_{\text{n.o.}} are observed to range from 0.28 to 2.51 for the 3d and 4d alloys; (iv) the spin-orbit scattering rates 1/\tau_{\text{n.o.}} are found to compare well with theoretical estimation using results from band-structure calculation. The effect of sample inhomogeneity on the value of \lambda_{\text{n.o.}} in Zr-Mo alloys is also illustrated. Inclusion of renormalization effects in several alloys yields somewhat reduced (at most by a factor of \sim 2 in Ti-V) values of \lambda_{\text{n.o.}}. Incorporating the strong-coupling correction intuitively into the theory does not seem to have an overall effect on the values of \lambda_{\text{n.o.}}.

## I Introduction

Experimental study of superconductors in high magnetic fields during the last two decades has been closely coupled with the development of detailed theory. The interactions of magnetic field with the motion and spin of the electrons of the Cooper pairs in superconductors, and the spin-orbit interaction, have been revealed to be significant in determining critical-field behavior. The theoretical development of Maki[1] predicted an upper bound (the Maki curve) on critical fields H_{\text{c2}}(T) as a result of orbital pair breaking. The further limitations of H_{\text{c2}}(T) by Pauli paramagnetism were subsequently quantified by Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg[2] along with the restorative effects on H_{\text{c2}}(T) of the spin-orbit interaction. The Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki (WHHM) theory was developed for weak-coupled, homogeneous, dirty superconductors. Comparison of theory with critical-field data was based on a two-parameter (\alpha and \lambda_{\text{n.o.}} representing Pauli paramagnetic limitation and spin-orbit scattering, respectively) curve-fitting procedure. As interest in critical fields has increased and data for a greater variety of superconductors have been achieved, refinement of theory has followed. Extension of the theory to include strong coupling has been attempted by Rainer and Bergmann.[3] Further refinement of the theory has included the effects of the electron-phonon interaction and electron-spin fluctuations, via a renormalization procedure as suggested by Orlando _et al.[4]_ The WHHM theory and developments can be found in several publications.[5, 6]

In this paper we report results obtained from a systematic and quantitative study of upper critical fields in metastable transition-metal-alloy superconductors. The latter class of materials offers an excellent opportunity for the extensive study of upper critical-field behavior H_{\text{c2}}(T) and to test the predictions of the WHHM theory. Generally these samples satisfy the "dirty limit." Employing the technique of liquid quenching, a large variety in the selection of the sample constituents which form a "single phase" can be attained, easily including transition metals from the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows of the Periodic Table (3d, 4d, and 5d series). Thus the spin-orbit scattering rate, a determining factor in the WHHM theory, can be varied. Samples of good homogeneity can be produced or the degree of homogeneity can be varied [so as to study the effect of inhomogeneity upon H_{\text{c2}}(T)]. Samples of varying superconducting transition temperature are attained (2.7 to 6.6 K). As a result, we are able to test the applicability of the WHHM theory in a variety of suitable samples, varying the parameters relevant to the WHHM theory over a wide range. We find that the WHHM theory provides good fits to the data for all samples, i.e., all our H_{\text{c2}}(T) data fall on or below the theoretical Maki curve. The renormalization procedure suggested by Orlando _et al.[4, 6]_ can also be applied and similarly good fits to the data are produced. The parameter estimates provided by the data analysis are in good agreement with theoretical estimates. The format of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II experimental procedures are given. Section III presents experimental results, analysis, and discussion. Section IV is the summary and conclusion.

 

## II Experimental

The samples examined in this study are all transition-metal binary alloys (see Table 1). Alloy constituents were selected from the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals, with superconducting transition temperatures of the alloys ranging from 2.7 to 6.6 K. The majority of the samples were produced by quenching onto a copper plate at a glancing angle. The copper plate was heated to 180 degC in an argon atmosphere. Foils 40 to 100 \mum thick were produced. Alloys of Zr-Pd, Zr-Mo, and Hf-Mo were liquid-quenched in this manner, while Ti-Mo and Ta-Hf did not require as high a cooling rate. The Ti-Pd samples were produced by a modified piston-anvil technique. All the above-mentioned alloys were produced in metastable, body-centered-cubic (b-phase) crystal structures. Details of sample preparation (and alloy structures) have been provided previously.7 The Zr75Rh25 samples were amorphous, produced by melt spinning in vacuum.

X-ray (Ni-filtered Cu _K_\alpha radiation) analysis indicated that the samples were single phase, except for Zr96Mo4 which contained traces of \alpha and \omega phases. The latter was intentionally selected so as to study the effects of inhomogeneity upon _H__e_2. Four terminal measurements of the zero-field superconducting transition of samples revealed transition widths (defined by the 0% and 90% points on the resistivity curve) of 5 to 500 mK (see Table 1). The samples were in the form of long, thin strips generally of thickness ~40 \mum, width ~0.1 cm, and length ~1 cm. Thin (0.01 cm diameter) copper leads were welded to the samples to facilitate four terminal resistivity measurements.

Measurements of critical fields _H__e_2(_T_) were undertaken at fields up to 90 kG and temperatures down to 0.5 K. A superconducting magnet with a 3-cm-diam, 3-cm-long homogeneous (0.2%) space was utilized. Three different refrigeration techniques were employed. Primary thermometry in all cases was provided by a calibrated Ge thermometer.8 At temperatures above 4.2 K the sample and sample holder were enclosed in (and thermally grounded to) a copper can, with a copper extension in contact with a 4He bath.9 Secondary thermometry, in magnetic fields, was provided by a capacitive thermometer, which also was used (with a properly positioned heater)9 for temperature regulation. Between 1.5 and 4.3 K the samples and sample holder were immersed in a pumped liquid 4He bath. Secondary thermometry was provided by measurement of the vapor pressure. Between 0.5 and 1.6 K samples and sample holder were immersed in a pumped 3He bath. Secondary thermometry was provided by measurement of vapor pressure. Good agreement [smooth-fitting _H__e_2(_T_) curves and agreement (1%) of overlapping data points] was observed between different temperature regimes.

All measurements were taken with the samples, and thus current density J, parallel to the field (_J_|_|_B_). Current densities were at all times less than 1 A/cm2. The magnetic field was swept at a constant positive rate of 6 kG/sec. For a given sweep, the 50% point (mid-point) and the extrapolated 0% point (end point) of the resistive transition upon increasing fields were recorded (see Fig. 1).

## III Results, Analysis, and Discussion

### Fitting H_{e2}(T) data

The critical field as a function of temperature, H_{e2}(T), is displayed for a number of alloys in Figs. 2-6 for temperatures 0.5 K <T<T_{e}. The vertical bars are not error bars per se, but reflect the field transition width (extrapolated 0% to midpoint, see Fig. 1). In general the H_{e2}(T) curves exhibit a negative curvature at low temperatures and high fields, approximating a linear slope as T approaches T_{e}. In Fig. 2 a qualitative trend in the data is revealed. Graphs of h^{\bullet}\!=\!H_{e2}(T)/(-dH_{e2}/dt)_{\rm\,near\,1} versus t\!=\!T/T_{e} for different alloys are displayed. It can be observed that as the alloy constituents are varied from 3d to 4d to 5d elements the negative curvature at low t decreases. The apparent enhancement of h^{\bullet} above the Maki limit (equal to 0.693) will be noted. Thus, independent of any fitting procedure, we can conclude that the spin-orbit scattering rate increases with increasing atomic number.

The critical-field data were analyzed via the WHHM theory. A two-parameter fit to the data was performed. The fitting parameters were the Maki paramagnetic limitation parameter \alpha and the spin-orbit scattering parameter \lambda_{\rm s,o}.

The value of \alpha is related to the electronic specific heat \gamma and the resistivity \rho_{n} in the normal state:

\[\alpha\!=\!3e^{2}\hbar\gamma\rho_{n}/2m\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}\ .\] (1)

With additional experimental data (i.e., accurate values for \rho_{n} and \gamma) \alpha can thus be determined and the data analysis reduced to a one-parameter fit. Barring such data, the analysis remains a two-parameter fit. We have chosen to determine the parameters \lambda_{\rm s,o} and \alpha_utilizing all the data_. The H_{e2}(T) data are fitted with the formula provided by WHH,2 in terms of digamma functions:

\[\ln\!\frac{1}{t} = \left[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i\lambda_{\rm s,o}}{4\gamma}\right]\psi( \frac{1}{2}+(\vec{R}+\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{\rm s,o}+i\gamma)/2t)\] (2) \[+ \left[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i\lambda_{\rm s,o}}{4\gamma}\right]\psi( \frac{1}{2}+(\vec{R}+\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{\rm s,o}-i\gamma)/2t)\] \[-\psi\left[\frac{1}{2}\right]\ ,\]

where \gamma\!=\![(\alpha\vec{n})^{2}\!-\!(\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{\rm s,o})^{2}]^{1/2}. Thus

\[\frac{\vec{R}}{(-d\vec{h}/dt)_{t=1}}\!=\!\frac{\pi^{2}\vec{h}}{4}\!=\!\frac{H _{e2}}{(-dH_{e2}/dt)_{t=1}}\] (3)

and

\[\alpha\!=\!5.3\!\times\!10^{-5}\left[\frac{-dH_{e2}(T)}{dT}\right]_{T=T_{e}}\ .\] (4)

Equation (4) offers an approximate value for \alpha if one estimates \left[dH_{e2}(T)/dT\right]_{T_{e}} utilizing data at temperatures near T_{e} (i.e., finds a visual gradient). We use \alpha deduced from the visual gradient as a guideline in beginning the least-squares fitting routine. The latter is performed on a CDC Cyber 855 computer. A grid search was utilized (to characterize the contours and to avoid local minima) followed by a gradient search method.10 To find \vec{h} for a given t, \alpha, and \lambda_{\rm s,o}, a bisection method was employed (as t can be a double-valued function of \vec{h} for \lambda_{\rm s,o}\!<\!\lambda_{\rm s,o}^{\rm s}\!=\!0.5319).2 The best fits to the 0% points are represented by the connected lines in Figs. 3-6, and the

Figure 3: Upper critical data (0% point) fitted to the WHHM theory for Ti_{8}Mo_{15} and Zr_{9}Mo_{7} samples. Vertical bars denote transition widths as defined in Fig. 1. Dotted and solid lines are obtained with and without renormalization correction, respectively. Transition temperatures T_{e} are the ones obtained at zero field.

 values for \lambda_{\rm s.o.} and \alpha are tabulated in Table 1. A check on the value of \alpha is provided utilizing data over a limited range (\sim0.9 < t < = 1.0), by comparing \alpha as deduced from the fitting procedure (\alpha fit) and \alpha as deduced from the visual gradient via Eq. (4) (\alpha visual). The probable error in \alpha as deduced via the slope of H_{\epsilon 2}(T) near T = T_{\epsilon} depends on the curvature of H_{\epsilon 2}(T) near T_{\epsilon}, i.e., on the values of \lambda_{\rm s.o.} and \alpha. The curvature of H_{\epsilon 2}(T) for T near T_{\epsilon} is greater for smaller \lambda_{\rm s.o} (or larger \alpha values). In fact, we note agreement between \alpha_{\rm fit} and \alpha_{\rm visual} only for very large \lambda_{\rm s.o.}, whereas \alpha_{\rm fit}\simeq1.19\alpha_{\rm visual} in the case of small \lambda_{\rm s.o.

  

### Spin-orbit scattering effects

The WHHM theory assumes that the spin-orbit scattering rate (1/_t_s.o.) is much less than the transport scattering rate (1/_t_tr). In general we observed [via fits of the H_{e^{2}}(T) data] the ratio _t_s.o/_t_tr to be much greater than 1. The 3d and 4d alloys examined revealed values of _l_a.o. < 3., i.e., _t_s.o. > 10-13 dec, [_t_s.o. = 2_ft_3_2k2_T_d_s.o.)-1].2 An estimation of _t_tr can be achieved via4_t_tr_d_2x10_t_y_t_o[_n The first alloy considered, Zr93Mo7, is stable in the \beta phase,[7] whereas Zr96Mo4 is on the phase boundary between \alpha-, \beta-, and \omega-Zr. X-ray diffraction reveals the presence of \alpha- and \omega-Zr in the Zr96Mo4 alloy only. Furthermore, it can be noted that the superconducting transition from 0% point to midpoint on the resistivity curve of Zr93Mo7 is narrower (\sim 200 mK) and sharper than that of Zr96Mo4 (\sim 400 mK).

When H_{\rm c2}(T) is examined for Zr93Mo7 values of \alpha = 2.0 and \lambda_{\rm s,o} = 1.9 are found via the WHHM analysis. The value of \lambda_{\rm s,o} T_{\rm c} = 9.8 is of the same order of magnitude as the other 4d alloys considered. However, H_{\rm c2}(T) for the Zr96Mo4 alloy displays large value for \lambda_{\rm s,o} (\lambda_{\rm s,0} = \infty ). We interpret this result as possible further evidence of the influence of inhomogeneity of a sample upon its critical-field behavior.[14] On the other hand, results on Zr75Rh25 annealed at 550 K for 68 h are very similar to the as-quenched sample (see Table 1). The transition width remains very sharp (\sim 5 mK).

### Renormalization and strong coupling corrections

Recently, evidence has been presented to the effect that electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions will decrease the Pauli limiting field, and lack of consideration of these effects will result in enormously large values of spin-orbit scattering rates.[4, 6] It was concluded that only by inclusion of these effects could H_{\rm c2}(T) data for Nb5Sn reasonably be fitted and it was stated that even in weak coupled superconductors the effects of electron-phonon renormalizations of normal-state parameters could be significant. Although we are able to fit our data quite reasonably within the auspices of the unrenormalized WHHM theory, we attempt to take this one step further by performing the renormalization procedure as suggested by Orlando and Beasley[4] for our H_{\rm c2}(T) data for a number of samples. We thus obtained values for the spin-orbit interaction parameter, renormalized (\lambda^{\prime}_{\rm s,o}) and the paramagnetic limitation parameter, renormalized (\alpha^{\prime}), as well as values for \lambda_{\rm s,ph} and \lambda_{\rm sf} (the mass renormalizations from the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions). Comparison can then be made with the "bare" values.

The renormalization procedure is based upon the enhancement of the Pauli limiting field H_{p}^{\rm BCS} by electron-phonon and electron-electron [and the related Stoner enhancement factor 1/(1-\overline{I})] many-body corrections. The enhancement is quantified:

\[H_{p} = (1 + \lambda_{\rm e,ph} + \lambda_{\rm sf})(1 - \overline{I})H_{p}^{\rm BCS}\ .\] (6)

With values for \lambda_{\rm e,ph}\lambda_{\rm sf}, and \overline{I} we substitute \alpha^{\prime} for \alpha in Eq. (2), where we obtain \alpha^{\prime}

\[\alpha^{\prime} = \frac{\alpha}{(1 + \lambda_{\rm e,ph} + \lambda_{\rm sf})(1 - \overline{I})}\ ,\] (7)

and redo the fits to the H_{\rm c2}(T) curves, where \alpha is given in Eq. (4). The values of \lambda_{\rm e,ph}\lambda_{\rm sf}, and \overline{I} are deduced from the T_{\rm c}, magnetic susceptibility, and mass enhancement equations:

\[T_{\rm c} = \frac{\Theta_{D}}{1.45}\exp\left[ { - \frac{1 + \lambda_{\rm e,ph} + \lambda_{\rm sf}}{\lambda_{\rm e,ph} - \lambda_{\rm sf} - \mu^{\star}}} \right]\ ,\] (8) \[\lambda_{\rm sf} = \frac{\alpha}{2}\overline{I}\ln\left[ { 1 + \frac{P_{1}^{2}}{12}\frac{\overline{I}}{1 - \overline{I}}} \right]\ ,\] (9) \[N^{\gamma}(0) = (1 + \lambda_{\rm e,ph} + \lambda_{\rm sf})N_{b}(0)\] (10) \[= 9.46 \times 10^{- 10}\frac{M}{\rho_{\star}d}\left[ { - \frac{dHc_{2}}{dT}} \right]_{T = T_{\rm c}}\ ,\]

\[\chi_{\rm p} = \frac{\mu_{B}^{2}N_{b}(0)}{1 - \overline{I}}\ ,\] (11)

where d is the density, \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature, P_{1} is a momentum cutoff parameter, and \mu^{\star} is taken to be 0.13. We do not deduce \overline{I} from experimental measurements of magnetic susceptibility as we are not able to separate the valence and Van Vleck terms; we instead depend upon values for the elements, calculated by Janak.[15] Janak actually supplies values of I, related to \overline{I} via

\[\overline{I} = 2N_{b}(0)I\ .\] (12)

It is found that the value of I (\simeq0.3 eV) is almost constant for the refractory metals.[15] Moreover, the theoretical Stoner enhancement factor also compares favorably with its experimental counterpart.[16] For the alloys, we have checked the experimental value of the Stoner enhancement factor in amorphous Zr72Cu28 corrected for the Van Vleck term.[17] It agrees with the theoretical value (\sim 1.6) obtained using N_{b}(0)=0.55 states/eV atom spin from specific-heat data[18] and I=0.34 eV from Janak.[15] The values for momentum cutoff P_{1} (expressed as a fraction of the Fermi momentum) for Nb and V are obtained from the theoretical results of Ref. [16] and Eq. (9). Assuming that the neighboring refractory metals (e.g., Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta) have similar P_{1} values for each series, we take (P_{1}^{2})_{3d}\simeq1.2, (P_{1}^{2})_{4d}\simeq(P_{1}^{2})_{5d}\approx2. Values of \Theta_{D} in general are obtained from the literature (see Table 2).

Knowing the _actual_ critical-field gradient, \Theta_{D}, T_{\rm c}, one can solve for \overline{I}, \lambda_{\rm e,ph}, \lambda_{\rm sf}, N_{b}(0) using Eqs. (8)--(10) and (12). Therefore, we can employ the grid-searching scheme discussed above to carry out the two-parameter fit to include renormalization effects. This is done for only five alloys where specific-heat data are available. We find that the quality of the fit to the data is also excellent. Results for some of the alloys are illustrated by dotted lines in the figures. The relevant parameters are listed in Table 2. Values of renormalized spin-orbit scattering parameters are somewhat (at most by a factor of 2) reduced from the bare values. The trend of \lambda_{\rm s,o} remains unchanged.

Until now, a theory which incorporates both renormalization and strong-coupling corrections has not been developed. In the case of very strong spin-orbit scattering (\lambda_{\rm s,o} \rightarrow\infty ), Rainer and Bergmann[3] calculated the enhancement of H_{\rm c2}(T) for several typical electron-phonon spectra. They quantified the enhancement by a parameter \eta_{H_{\rm c2}}(T)=H_{\rm c2}(T)/H_{\rm c2}^{\rm BCS}(T). Results at T = 0 and T_{\rm c} were given for the Debye model as a function of T_{\rm c}/\langle\omega\rangle, where \langle\omega\rangle is the average phonon frequency. The function \eta_{H_{\rm c2}}(T)\simeq1 was found to increase as a func  tion of temperature. Assuming that this trend holds for our samples, the H_{\rm e2}^{\rm BCS}(T) data to be fitted to the WHHM theory will tend to follow a curve with decreasing curvature towards T_{\epsilon}. The latter tends to increase the value of \lambda_{\rm s.o.}^{\prime} in the curve-fitting procedure. On the other hand, a reduced field gradient at T_{\epsilon} also decreases the value of \alpha^{\prime} and thus the value of \lambda_{\rm s.o.}^{\prime}. To examine the overall effect more quantitatively, we divide our H_{\epsilon 2}(T) data by an extrapolated function \eta_{H_{\epsilon 2}}(t){\simeq}1.06+0.05t, a form compatible with typical T_{\epsilon}/(\omega) values.[3] Curve fitting to the corrected H_{\epsilon 2}(T) data results in \lambda_{\rm s.o.}^{\prime}= 0.12 for Ti-V, 1.3 for Zr-Rh, and \infty for Ta-Hf alloys. Therefore, the net effect due to strong coupling correction on the values of \lambda_{\rm s.o.}^{\prime} (see Table II) might be small.

## IV Summary and Conclusion

We have measured in detail (H\leq 90 kG, T_{\epsilon}>T> 0.5 K) the upper critical fields in several liquid-quenched metastable superconductors. Analysis is performed within the framework of the WHHM theory using all the data (weighted equally) in a two-parameter (\alpha,\lambda_{\rm s.o.}) curve-fitting procedure. Excellent fits are obtained. The spin-orbit scattering parameter \lambda_{\rm s.o.} is found to be smaller than \sim 2.5 for the 3d and 4d alloys. Sample inhomogeneity is found to increase the \lambda_{\rm s.o.} value significantly. Otherwise, no enhancement (with the exception of one data point in Hf-Mo) of H_{\epsilon 2}(T) above the Maki curve (\lambda_{\rm s.o.}=\infty) is observed. The spin-orbit scattering time is compared favorably to data obtained from band-structure calculation. An attempt is made to include both renormalization and strong coupling corrections in the data analysis. The overall effect reduces the value of \lambda_{\rm s.o.} by at most a factor of \sim 2 in our samples. The relative insensitivity of renormalization correction in our alloys is probably due to the mutually compensating factors (1+\lambda_{\rm s.o.}+\lambda_{\rm sf}) and (1-\bar{T}). Also, in bulk samples, orbital pair breaking already plays a major role in determining the upper critical field. This is different in thin films[19] where renormalization correction can have a very important effect on the value of \lambda_{\rm s.o.}.

###### Abstract

A systematic and quantitative study of upper critical fields in alloys with increasing atomic number is carried out. The alloys are prepared by the technique of liquid (splat) quenching. They include the metastable body-centered-cubic (\beta) phase of Ti-Pd, Zr-Mo, Zr-Pd, and Hf-Mo, amorphous phase of Zr-Rh, and the stable \beta phase of Ti-Mo and Ta-Hf. Measurements are made in magnetic fields up to 90 kG and in temperatures down to 0.5 K. The results are analyzed within the framework of the dirty-limit theory of Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki (WHHM). A least-squares fitting routine is performed using _all the data_ (weighted equally) for a given sample. It is emphasized that the visual critical-field gradient near the transition temperature cannot be taken as the actual gradient in the presence of Pauli paramagnetic limitation. The main findings are the following: (i) Even without including renormalization corrections due to electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions, very good fits to the WHHM theory are obtained; (ii) critical-field data for all our samples (with minor exceptions in Hf-Mo) are found to fall below or on the Maki curve (i.e., when the spin-orbit scattering parameter \lambda_{\text{n.o.}} goes to infinity); (iii) values of \lambda_{\text{n.o.}} are observed to range from 0.28 to 2.51 for the 3d and 4d alloys; (iv) the spin-orbit scattering rates 1/\tau_{\text{n.o.}} are found to compare well with theoretical estimation using results from band-structure calculation. The effect of sample inhomogeneity on the value of \lambda_{\text{n.o.}} in Zr-Mo alloys is also illustrated. Inclusion of renormalization effects in several alloys yields somewhat reduced (at most by a factor of \sim 2 in Ti-V) values of \lambda_{\text{n.o.}}. Incorporating the strong-coupling correction intuitively into the theory does not seem to have an overall effect on the values of \lambda_{\text{n.o.}}.

## I Introduction

Experimental study of superconductors in high magnetic fields during the last two decades has been closely coupled with the development of detailed theory. The interactions of magnetic field with the motion and spin of the electrons of the Cooper pairs in superconductors, and the spin-orbit interaction, have been revealed to be significant in determining critical-field behavior. The theoretical development of Maki[1] predicted an upper bound (the Maki curve) on critical fields H_{\text{c2}}(T) as a result of orbital pair breaking. The further limitations of H_{\text{c2}}(T) by Pauli paramagnetism were subsequently quantified by Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg[2] along with the restorative effects on H_{\text{c2}}(T) of the spin-orbit interaction. The Werthamer, Helfand, Hohenberg, and Maki (WHHM) theory was developed for weak-coupled, homogeneous, dirty superconductors. Comparison of theory with critical-field data was based on a two-parameter (\alpha and \lambda_{\text{n.o.}} representing Pauli paramagnetic limitation and spin-orbit scattering, respectively) curve-fitting procedure. As interest in critical fields has increased and data for a greater variety of superconductors have been achieved, refinement of theory has followed. Extension of the theory to include strong coupling has been attempted by Rainer and Bergmann.[3] Further refinement of the theory has included the effects of the electron-phonon interaction and electron-spin fluctuations, via a renormalization procedure as suggested by Orlando _et al.[4]_ The WHHM theory and developments can be found in several publications.[5, 6]

In this paper we report results obtained from a systematic and quantitative study of upper critical fields in metastable transition-metal-alloy superconductors. The latter class of materials offers an excellent opportunity for the extensive study of upper critical-field behavior H_{\text{c2}}(T) and to test the predictions of the WHHM theory. Generally these samples satisfy the "dirty limit." Employing the technique of liquid quenching, a large variety in the selection of the sample constituents which form a "single phase" can be attained, easily including transition metals from the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows of the Periodic Table (3d, 4d, and 5d series). Thus the spin-orbit scattering rate, a determining factor in the WHHM theory, can be varied. Samples of good homogeneity can be produced or the degree of homogeneity can be varied [so as to study the effect of inhomogeneity upon H_{\text{c2}}(T)]. Samples of varying superconducting transition temperature are attained (2.7 to 6.6 K). As a result, we are able to test the applicability of the WHHM theory in a variety of suitable samples, varying the parameters relevant to the WHHM theory over a wide range. We find that the WHHM theory provides good fits to the data for all samples, i.e., all our H_{\text{c2}}(T) data fall on or below the theoretical Maki curve. The renormalization procedure suggested by Orlando _et al.[4, 6]_ can also be applied and similarly good fits to the data are produced. The parameter estimates provided by the data analysis are in good agreement with theoretical estimates. The format of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II experimental procedures are given. Section III presents experimental results, analysis, and discussion. Section IV is the summary and conclusion.

 

## II Experimental

The samples examined in this study are all transition-metal binary alloys (see Table 1). Alloy constituents were selected from the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals, with superconducting transition temperatures of the alloys ranging from 2.7 to 6.6 K. The majority of the samples were produced by quenching onto a copper plate at a glancing angle. The copper plate was heated to 180 degC in an argon atmosphere. Foils 40 to 100 \mum thick were produced. Alloys of Zr-Pd, Zr-Mo, and Hf-Mo were liquid-quenched in this manner, while Ti-Mo and Ta-Hf did not require as high a cooling rate. The Ti-Pd samples were produced by a modified piston-anvil technique. All the above-mentioned alloys were produced in metastable, body-centered-cubic (b-phase) crystal structures. Details of sample preparation (and alloy structures) have been provided previously.7 The Zr75Rh25 samples were amorphous, produced by melt spinning in vacuum.

X-ray (Ni-filtered Cu _K_\alpha radiation) analysis indicated that the samples were single phase, except for Zr96Mo4 which contained traces of \alpha and \omega phases. The latter was intentionally selected so as to study the effects of inhomogeneity upon _H__e_2. Four terminal measurements of the zero-field superconducting transition of samples revealed transition widths (defined by the 0% and 90% points on the resistivity curve) of 5 to 500 mK (see Table 1). The samples were in the form of long, thin strips generally of thickness ~40 \mum, width ~0.1 cm, and length ~1 cm. Thin (0.01 cm diameter) copper leads were welded to the samples to facilitate four terminal resistivity measurements.

Measurements of critical fields _H__e_2(_T_) were undertaken at fields up to 90 kG and temperatures down to 0.5 K. A superconducting magnet with a 3-cm-diam, 3-cm-long homogeneous (0.2%) space was utilized. Three different refrigeration techniques were employed. Primary thermometry in all cases was provided by a calibrated Ge thermometer.8 At temperatures above 4.2 K the sample and sample holder were enclosed in (and thermally grounded to) a copper can, with a copper extension in contact with a 4He bath.9 Secondary thermometry, in magnetic fields, was provided by a capacitive thermometer, which also was used (with a properly positioned heater)9 for temperature regulation. Between 1.5 and 4.3 K the samples and sample holder were immersed in a pumped liquid 4He bath. Secondary thermometry was provided by measurement of the vapor pressure. Between 0.5 and 1.6 K samples and sample holder were immersed in a pumped 3He bath. Secondary thermometry was provided by measurement of vapor pressure. Good agreement [smooth-fitting _H__e_2(_T_) curves and agreement (1%) of overlapping data points] was observed between different temperature regimes.

All measurements were taken with the samples, and thus current density J, parallel to the field (_J_|_|_B_). Current densities were at all times less than 1 A/cm2. The magnetic field was swept at a constant positive rate of 6 kG/sec. For a given sweep, the 50% point (mid-point) and the extrapolated 0% point (end point) of the resistive transition upon increasing fields were recorded (see Fig. 1).

## III Results, Analysis, and Discussion

### Fitting H_{e2}(T) data

The critical field as a function of temperature, H_{e2}(T), is displayed for a number of alloys in Figs. 2-6 for temperatures 0.5 K <T<T_{e}. The vertical bars are not error bars per se, but reflect the field transition width (extrapolated 0% to midpoint, see Fig. 1). In general the H_{e2}(T) curves exhibit a negative curvature at low temperatures and high fields, approximating a linear slope as T approaches T_{e}. In Fig. 2 a qualitative trend in the data is revealed. Graphs of h^{\bullet}\!=\!H_{e2}(T)/(-dH_{e2}/dt)_{\rm\,near\,1} versus t\!=\!T/T_{e} for different alloys are displayed. It can be observed that as the alloy constituents are varied from 3d to 4d to 5d elements the negative curvature at low t decreases. The apparent enhancement of h^{\bullet} above the Maki limit (equal to 0.693) will be noted. Thus, independent of any fitting procedure, we can conclude that the spin-orbit scattering rate increases with increasing atomic number.

The critical-field data were analyzed via the WHHM theory. A two-parameter fit to the data was performed. The fitting parameters were the Maki paramagnetic limitation parameter \alpha and the spin-orbit scattering parameter \lambda_{\rm s,o}.

The value of \alpha is related to the electronic specific heat \gamma and the resistivity \rho_{n} in the normal state:

\[\alpha\!=\!3e^{2}\hbar\gamma\rho_{n}/2m\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}\ .\] (1)

With additional experimental data (i.e., accurate values for \rho_{n} and \gamma) \alpha can thus be determined and the data analysis reduced to a one-parameter fit. Barring such data, the analysis remains a two-parameter fit. We have chosen to determine the parameters \lambda_{\rm s,o} and \alpha_utilizing all the data_. The H_{e2}(T) data are fitted with the formula provided by WHH,2 in terms of digamma functions:

\[\ln\!\frac{1}{t} = \left[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i\lambda_{\rm s,o}}{4\gamma}\right]\psi( \frac{1}{2}+(\vec{R}+\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{\rm s,o}+i\gamma)/2t)\] (2) \[+ \left[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{i\lambda_{\rm s,o}}{4\gamma}\right]\psi( \frac{1}{2}+(\vec{R}+\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{\rm s,o}-i\gamma)/2t)\] \[-\psi\left[\frac{1}{2}\right]\ ,\]

where \gamma\!=\![(\alpha\vec{n})^{2}\!-\!(\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{\rm s,o})^{2}]^{1/2}. Thus

\[\frac{\vec{R}}{(-d\vec{h}/dt)_{t=1}}\!=\!\frac{\pi^{2}\vec{h}}{4}\!=\!\frac{H _{e2}}{(-dH_{e2}/dt)_{t=1}}\] (3)

and

\[\alpha\!=\!5.3\!\times\!10^{-5}\left[\frac{-dH_{e2}(T)}{dT}\right]_{T=T_{e}}\ .\] (4)

Equation (4) offers an approximate value for \alpha if one estimates \left[dH_{e2}(T)/dT\right]_{T_{e}} utilizing data at temperatures near T_{e} (i.e., finds a visual gradient). We use \alpha deduced from the visual gradient as a guideline in beginning the least-squares fitting routine. The latter is performed on a CDC Cyber 855 computer. A grid search was utilized (to characterize the contours and to avoid local minima) followed by a gradient search method.10 To find \vec{h} for a given t, \alpha, and \lambda_{\rm s,o}, a bisection method was employed (as t can be a double-valued function of \vec{h} for \lambda_{\rm s,o}\!<\!\lambda_{\rm s,o}^{\rm s}\!=\!0.5319).2 The best fits to the 0% points are represented by the connected lines in Figs. 3-6, and the

Figure 3: Upper critical data (0% point) fitted to the WHHM theory for Ti_{8}Mo_{15} and Zr_{9}Mo_{7} samples. Vertical bars denote transition widths as defined in Fig. 1. Dotted and solid lines are obtained with and without renormalization correction, respectively. Transition temperatures T_{e} are the ones obtained at zero field.

 values for \lambda_{\rm s.o.} and \alpha are tabulated in Table 1. A check on the value of \alpha is provided utilizing data over a limited range (\sim0.9 < t < = 1.0), by comparing \alpha as deduced from the fitting procedure (\alpha fit) and \alpha as deduced from the visual gradient via Eq. (4) (\alpha visual). The probable error in \alpha as deduced via the slope of H_{\epsilon 2}(T) near T = T_{\epsilon} depends on the curvature of H_{\epsilon 2}(T) near T_{\epsilon}, i.e., on the values of \lambda_{\rm s.o.} and \alpha. The curvature of H_{\epsilon 2}(T) for T near T_{\epsilon} is greater for smaller \lambda_{\rm s.o} (or larger \alpha values). In fact, we note agreement between \alpha_{\rm fit} and \alpha_{\rm visual} only for very large \lambda_{\rm s.o.}, whereas \alpha_{\rm fit}\simeq1.19\alpha_{\rm visual} in the case of small \lambda_{\rm s.o.

  

### Spin-orbit scattering effects

The WHHM theory assumes that the spin-orbit scattering rate (1/_t_s.o.) is much less than the transport scattering rate (1/_t_tr). In general we observed [via fits of the H_{e^{2}}(T) data] the ratio _t_s.o/_t_tr to be much greater than 1. The 3d and 4d alloys examined revealed values of _l_a.o. < 3., i.e., _t_s.o. > 10-13 dec, [_t_s.o. = 2_ft_3_2k2_T_d_s.o.)-1].2 An estimation of _t_tr can be achieved via4_t_tr_d_2x10_t_y_t_o[_n The first alloy considered, Zr93Mo7, is stable in the \beta phase,[7] whereas Zr96Mo4 is on the phase boundary between \alpha-, \beta-, and \omega-Zr. X-ray diffraction reveals the presence of \alpha- and \omega-Zr in the Zr96Mo4 alloy only. Furthermore, it can be noted that the superconducting transition from 0% point to midpoint on the resistivity curve of Zr93Mo7 is narrower (\sim 200 mK) and sharper than that of Zr96Mo4 (\sim 400 mK).

When H_{\rm c2}(T) is examined for Zr93Mo7 values of \alpha = 2.0 and \lambda_{\rm s,o} = 1.9 are found via the WHHM analysis. The value of \lambda_{\rm s,o} T_{\rm c} = 9.8 is of the same order of magnitude as the other 4d alloys considered. However, H_{\rm c2}(T) for the Zr96Mo4 alloy displays large value for \lambda_{\rm s,o} (\lambda_{\rm s,0} = \infty ). We interpret this result as possible further evidence of the influence of inhomogeneity of a sample upon its critical-field behavior.[14] On the other hand, results on Zr75Rh25 annealed at 550 K for 68 h are very similar to the as-quenched sample (see Table 1). The transition width remains very sharp (\sim 5 mK).

### Renormalization and strong coupling corrections

Recently, evidence has been presented to the effect that electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions will decrease the Pauli limiting field, and lack of consideration of these effects will result in enormously large values of spin-orbit scattering rates.[4, 6] It was concluded that only by inclusion of these effects could H_{\rm c2}(T) data for Nb5Sn reasonably be fitted and it was stated that even in weak coupled superconductors the effects of electron-phonon renormalizations of normal-state parameters could be significant. Although we are able to fit our data quite reasonably within the auspices of the unrenormalized WHHM theory, we attempt to take this one step further by performing the renormalization procedure as suggested by Orlando and Beasley[4] for our H_{\rm c2}(T) data for a number of samples. We thus obtained values for the spin-orbit interaction parameter, renormalized (\lambda^{\prime}_{\rm s,o}) and the paramagnetic limitation parameter, renormalized (\alpha^{\prime}), as well as values for \lambda_{\rm s,ph} and \lambda_{\rm sf} (the mass renormalizations from the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions). Comparison can then be made with the "bare" values.

The renormalization procedure is based upon the enhancement of the Pauli limiting field H_{p}^{\rm BCS} by electron-phonon and electron-electron [and the related Stoner enhancement factor 1/(1-\overline{I})] many-body corrections. The enhancement is quantified:

\[H_{p} = (1 + \lambda_{\rm e,ph} + \lambda_{\rm sf})(1 - \overline{I})H_{p}^{\rm BCS}\ .\] (6)

With values for \lambda_{\rm e,ph}\lambda_{\rm sf}, and \overline{I} we substitute \alpha^{\prime} for \alpha in Eq. (2), where we obtain \alpha^{\prime}

\[\alpha^{\prime} = \frac{\alpha}{(1 + \lambda_{\rm e,ph} + \lambda_{\rm sf})(1 - \overline{I})}\ ,\] (7)

and redo the fits to the H_{\rm c2}(T) curves, where \alpha is given in Eq. (4). The values of \lambda_{\rm e,ph}\lambda_{\rm sf}, and \overline{I} are deduced from the T_{\rm c}, magnetic susceptibility, and mass enhancement equations:

\[T_{\rm c} = \frac{\Theta_{D}}{1.45}\exp\left[ { - \frac{1 + \lambda_{\rm e,ph} + \lambda_{\rm sf}}{\lambda_{\rm e,ph} - \lambda_{\rm sf} - \mu^{\star}}} \right]\ ,\] (8) \[\lambda_{\rm sf} = \frac{\alpha}{2}\overline{I}\ln\left[ { 1 + \frac{P_{1}^{2}}{12}\frac{\overline{I}}{1 - \overline{I}}} \right]\ ,\] (9) \[N^{\gamma}(0) = (1 + \lambda_{\rm e,ph} + \lambda_{\rm sf})N_{b}(0)\] (10) \[= 9.46 \times 10^{- 10}\frac{M}{\rho_{\star}d}\left[ { - \frac{dHc_{2}}{dT}} \right]_{T = T_{\rm c}}\ ,\]

\[\chi_{\rm p} = \frac{\mu_{B}^{2}N_{b}(0)}{1 - \overline{I}}\ ,\] (11)

where d is the density, \Theta_{D} is the Debye temperature, P_{1} is a momentum cutoff parameter, and \mu^{\star} is taken to be 0.13. We do not deduce \overline{I} from experimental measurements of magnetic susceptibility as we are not able to separate the valence and Van Vleck terms; we instead depend upon values for the elements, calculated by Janak.[15] Janak actually supplies values of I, related to \overline{I} via

\[\overline{I} = 2N_{b}(0)I\ .\] (12)

It is found that the value of I (\simeq0.3 eV) is almost constant for the refractory metals.[15] Moreover, the theoretical Stoner enhancement factor also compares favorably with its experimental counterpart.[16] For the alloys, we have checked the experimental value of the Stoner enhancement factor in amorphous Zr72Cu28 corrected for the Van Vleck term.[17] It agrees with the theoretical value (\sim 1.6) obtained using N_{b}(0)=0.55 states/eV atom spin from specific-heat data[18] and I=0.34 eV from Janak.[15] The values for momentum cutoff P_{1} (expressed as a fraction of the Fermi momentum) for Nb and V are obtained from the theoretical results of Ref. [16] and Eq. (9). Assuming that the neighboring refractory metals (e.g., Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta) have similar P_{1} values for each series, we take (P_{1}^{2})_{3d}\simeq1.2, (P_{1}^{2})_{4d}\simeq(P_{1}^{2})_{5d}\approx2. Values of \Theta_{D} in general are obtained from the literature (see Table 2).

Knowing the _actual_ critical-field gradient, \Theta_{D}, T_{\rm c}, one can solve for \overline{I}, \lambda_{\rm e,ph}, \lambda_{\rm sf}, N_{b}(0) using Eqs. (8)--(10) and (12). Therefore, we can employ the grid-searching scheme discussed above to carry out the two-parameter fit to include renormalization effects. This is done for only five alloys where specific-heat data are available. We find that the quality of the fit to the data is also excellent. Results for some of the alloys are illustrated by dotted lines in the figures. The relevant parameters are listed in Table 2. Values of renormalized spin-orbit scattering parameters are somewhat (at most by a factor of 2) reduced from the bare values. The trend of \lambda_{\rm s,o} remains unchanged.

Until now, a theory which incorporates both renormalization and strong-coupling corrections has not been developed. In the case of very strong spin-orbit scattering (\lambda_{\rm s,o} \rightarrow\infty ), Rainer and Bergmann[3] calculated the enhancement of H_{\rm c2}(T) for several typical electron-phonon spectra. They quantified the enhancement by a parameter \eta_{H_{\rm c2}}(T)=H_{\rm c2}(T)/H_{\rm c2}^{\rm BCS}(T). Results at T = 0 and T_{\rm c} were given for the Debye model as a function of T_{\rm c}/\langle\omega\rangle, where \langle\omega\rangle is the average phonon frequency. The function \eta_{H_{\rm c2}}(T)\simeq1 was found to increase as a func  tion of temperature. Assuming that this trend holds for our samples, the H_{\rm e2}^{\rm BCS}(T) data to be fitted to the WHHM theory will tend to follow a curve with decreasing curvature towards T_{\epsilon}. The latter tends to increase the value of \lambda_{\rm s.o.}^{\prime} in the curve-fitting procedure. On the other hand, a reduced field gradient at T_{\epsilon} also decreases the value of \alpha^{\prime} and thus the value of \lambda_{\rm s.o.}^{\prime}. To examine the overall effect more quantitatively, we divide our H_{\epsilon 2}(T) data by an extrapolated function \eta_{H_{\epsilon 2}}(t){\simeq}1.06+0.05t, a form compatible with typical T_{\epsilon}/(\omega) values.[3] Curve fitting to the corrected H_{\epsilon 2}(T) data results in \lambda_{\rm s.o.}^{\prime}= 0.12 for Ti-V, 1.3 for Zr-Rh, and \infty for Ta-Hf alloys. Therefore, the net effect due to strong coupling correction on the values of \lambda_{\rm s.o.}^{\prime} (see Table II) might be small.

## IV Summary and Conclusion

We have measured in detail (H\leq 90 kG, T_{\epsilon}>T> 0.5 K) the upper critical fields in several liquid-quenched metastable superconductors. Analysis is performed within the framework of the WHHM theory using all the data (weighted equally) in a two-parameter (\alpha,\lambda_{\rm s.o.}) curve-fitting procedure. Excellent fits are obtained. The spin-orbit scattering parameter \lambda_{\rm s.o.} is found to be smaller than \sim 2.5 for the 3d and 4d alloys. Sample inhomogeneity is found to increase the \lambda_{\rm s.o.} value significantly. Otherwise, no enhancement (with the exception of one data point in Hf-Mo) of H_{\epsilon 2}(T) above the Maki curve (\lambda_{\rm s.o.}=\infty) is observed. The spin-orbit scattering time is compared favorably to data obtained from band-structure calculation. An attempt is made to include both renormalization and strong coupling corrections in the data analysis. The overall effect reduces the value of \lambda_{\rm s.o.} by at most a factor of \sim 2 in our samples. The relative insensitivity of renormalization correction in our alloys is probably due to the mutually compensating factors (1+\lambda_{\rm s.o.}+\lambda_{\rm sf}) and (1-\bar{T}). Also, in bulk samples, orbital pair breaking already plays a major role in determining the upper critical field. This is different in thin films[19] where renormalization correction can have a very important effect on the value of \lambda_{\rm s.o.}.
