###### Abstract

The specific heat of neutron-irradiated Nb3Al has been measured in the temperature range 1.3\(\times\)10\({}^{18}\) and 1.3\(\times\)10\({}^{19}\)\(n\)/cm\({}^{2}\) (\(E>\) 1 MeV). A reduction in the superconducting transition temperature is accompanied by an increase in transition width with increasing fluence. The Debye temperature increases 20%, and the electronic density of states shows a slight decrease that is within error limits, relative to the unirradiated material.

## 1 Introduction

There has been considerable interest in the effects of particle irradiation on the properties of \(A\)15 compounds in recent years. Previous studies[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] have revealed several trends including (1) a reduction in the superconducting transition temperature _T_c, (2) a decreased electronic density of states, and (3) an increased lattice parameter, all relative to the unirradiated material. The unirradiated-state properties are restored upon annealing at temperatures where reordering by thermally generated vacancies occurs, and there is evidence to suggest that the effects of radiation damage on several properties are equivalent to those of the specimen's composition being off stoichiometry.[2, 3, 4]

We report specific-heat measurements on the \(A\)15 phase of Nb3Al before and after irradiation with fast neutrons. These data are preceded by similar studies of Viswanathan and Caton[5] on V3Si where interpretation of their results was complicated by possible uncertainties in the exact thermal histories of their irradiated samples. By comparison, the radiation-induced defects in Nb3Al begin to recover at a significantly higher temperature[3] than in V3Si and should therefore provide more reliable data. Also, it is a low-density-of-states _N_(0) material while V3Si has a high density of states. Thus, the behavior of _N_(0) with fluence might be different in the two systems.

## 2 Sample preparation and characterization

The samples used in this study were prepared by arc-melting Nb and Al powders as described in detail in Ref. 2, followed by anneals of 10 h at 2030 K and 1 week at 1020 K. The resulting material had a composition of 24\(\pm\)0.5 at.% Al, determined by electron microprobe analysis, and was at least 98% single phase, as indicated by x-ray diffractometry. The lattice parameter was 5.186 +- 0.001 A which differs from values of 5.184 and 5.181 A predicted for this composition by Moehlecke[2] and Kwo _et al._,[9] respectively. Spitzli[10] reports 5.181 +- 0.005 A for this composition.

Specific-heat data are reported for three samples with masses in the range 25-55 mg. Two were irradiated with fast neutrons in the Brookhaven High Flux Beam Reactor to total fluences of 1.3 x 10\({}^{18}\) and 1.3 x 10\({}^{19}\)\(n\)/cm\({}^{2}\) (\(E>\) 1 MeV), respectively. The third was not irradiated.

## 3 Experimental procedures and results

Specific-heat measurements were made using the decay-constant method.[11] The apparatus is a small-sample calorimeter described fully in Refs. 12 and 13. Temperatures are determined by means of two calibrated Ge thermometers with an accuracy of +- 0.10 K. Corrections for self-heating from the radioactive samples did not exceed 0.5 K below 2 K and were insignificant above 4 K. The maximum addenda contribution to the total heat capacity was 40% at 1.3 K and 16% at 25 K. Similar measurements with high-purity Ge samples indicate an absolute accuracy for the present work of +- 4%. The internal precision of the data for the three samples is +- 2%.

The specific heat divided by the measured temperature, _C_/_T_, is plotted as a function of \(T\)2 for each specimen in Figs. 1-3. Two features are immediately seen. For the irradiated samples, the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{\rm c}\) is depressed, and the transition is broadened. Midpoint and onset \(T_{\rm c}\)'s and transition widths \(\Delta T_{\rm c}\) (equal to the onset \(T_{\rm c}\) minus the peak \(T_{\rm c}\)) are listed in Table 1 for each fluence. Inductively measured \(T_{\rm c}\)'s are shown for comparison

with the onset \(T_{\rm c}\)'s. A reduction in midpoint \(T_{\rm c}\) of 6% occurs at the low fluence and of 50% at the higher dose. Substantial broadening is produced even at the low fluence, a phenomenon not seen[5] in irradiated V\({}_{3}\)Si. This difference in behavior will be discussed below.

The specific heat of a normal metal at sufficiently low temperature may be approximated by

\[C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}\;\;,\] (1)

where \(C_{\rm c}=\gamma T\) is the electronic contribution, and \(C_{L}=\beta T^{3}\) is the lattice contribution. The normal-state specific heat of a high-\(T_{\rm c}\)\(A15\) compound often exhibits higher-order terms in this expansion, rendering a simple linear fit to \(C/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) above \(T_{\rm c}\) inadequate for determining \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\). An alternative value of \(\beta\) can be found from the specific heat for \(T<<T_{\rm c}\) since in this region, \(C_{\rm c}\equiv 0\), and \(C=C_{L}=\beta T^{3}\). In addition, for a second-order phase transition, the entropy \(S\) is continuous at \(T_{\rm c}\). Applied to a superconductor, this constraint, \(S_{\rm a}(T_{\rm c})=S_{\rm a}(T_{\rm c})\)  higher fluence.

The electronic density of states at the Fermi surface, _N_(0), in states/eV atom may be obtained from

\[\gamma = N(0)(1 + \lambda)/0.1061\]

and the Debye temperature Ph_D_, from

\[\beta = 1944(4 \times 10^{3})/\Theta_{D}^{3}\;\;,\]

where \(g\) is in mJ/mole K2, \(b\) is in mJ/mole K4, and \(l\) is the electron-phonon coupling constant. Values for Ph_D_ determined from both the normal-state (_T_ > _T_c) and low-temperature data (_T_ < _T_c) are given in Table 1. The low-temperature data are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for zero and low fluence. For the higher fluence, the pure \(T\)3 region was not attainable by pumping on the liquid 4He. A comparison of normal-state Ph_D_'s for our samples indicates a pattern of lattice stiffening with damage.

For low-_T_c superconductors, the electron-phonon coupling parameter \(l\) can be calculated from the McMillan expression15 with the Coulomb coupling constant _m_' = 0.10. This equation is not valid for high-_T_c superconductors, and for these cases \(l\) must be determined from tunneling data. The estimates of \(l\) in Table 1 for zero and low fluence are extrapolated for this composition from the tunneling results of Kwo and Geballe,19 and the high-fluence value is found from McMillan's formula. The _l_'s are then used to calculate _N_(0) via Eq. (3) with the results displayed in Table 1. The variation of _N_(0) with damage is within experimental uncertainty. It should be noted that Ghosh and Strongin8 report _N_(0) = 0.70 states/eV atom from resistivity and critical-field data with \(l\) = 1.4 and \(g\) = 30 +- 2 mJ/mole K2. This value decreases to 0.5 states/eV atom for samples equivalent to ours irradiated to 1.3 x 1019 _n_/cm2. This factor-of-2 difference is due to their estimates actually having units of states/eV atom spin.

From the relation

\[\int_{0}^{T_{c}}\left( {C_{s} - C_{n}} \right)\,dT = \frac{VH_{e}^{2}(0)}{8\pi}\;\;,\]

the thermodynamic critical field _H_c(0) may be determined. The magnitude of the molar volume \(V\) is calculated from the lattice parameter of 5.186 A for zero and low fluences. For the higher fluence, the lattice

  parameter is estimated from the work of Moehlecke2 to be 5.195 A, based on fluence and composition. \(H_{\rm{e}}(0)\) decreases systematically with increasing fluence (Table 1).

The size of the reduced specific-heat discontinuity \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{e}}\) is one measure of the electron-phonon coupling strength. For a broadened transition, there is some ambiguity in this parameter, and the values listed in column 2 of Table 2 are taken as the peak of the transition minus the normal-state extrapolation at the temperature of the peak, in each case.

A second parameter which specifies electron-phonon coupling strength is \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}\), the reduced energy gap. Since in the superconducting state, the BCS theory predicts for the electronic specific heat \(C_{\rm{es}}\) the exponential form

\[C_{\rm{es}}/\gamma T_{\rm{e}}=a\,\exp[-\Delta(\,T\,)/k_{B}T]\;\;\;,\] (6)

\(\Delta(\,T\,)/k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}\) should be the negative slope of \(\ln C_{\rm{es}}\) vs \(T_{\rm{e}}/T\). However, as pointed out in Refs. [16]\(-\)[18], electronic specific-heat data for superconductors typically do not obey Eq. (6) but yield the type of curves shown in Figs. 6\(-\)[8] for our samples. It has been suggested [16, 17] that \(2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}\) may be found from the slope of \(\ln C_{\rm{es}}\) vs \(T_{\rm{e}}/T\) near \(T_{\rm{e}}\), and this method works well[18] for many superconductors. For unirradiated Nb3Al, this analysis yields \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}=5.6\), an unusually large value. However, tunneling results[19] extrapolated to this composition are also quite large, \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}\simeq 5.0\). For irradiated Nb3Al, the values listed in column 3 of Table 2 show a definite trend of decreased coupling as expected. Using these values to calculate \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{e}}\) for an ideally sharp transition via the relation

\[\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{e}}=C_{\rm{es}}/\gamma T_{\rm{e}}-1\] (7)

and Eq. (6), we obtain the magnitudes given in column 4, Table 2, which are consistent with weakened electron-phonon coupling with increasing fluence. Another method of calculating \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}\) is by using the equation

\[\frac{2\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}}=\frac{H_{\rm{e}}(0)}{T_{\rm{e}}}\left[ \frac{2\pi\nu}{3\gamma}\right]^{1/2}\;\;.\] (8)

For these data Eq. (8) gives the results of column 5,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Fluence (\(n/\)cm\({}^{2}\)) & \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{e}}\) & \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}\) & \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{\rm{e}}\) & \(2\Delta/k_{B}T_{\rm{e}}\) \\ (Peak) & (Slope) & (Sharp) & [\(H_{\rm{e}}(0)\)] \\

Data for a fourth Nb3Al specimen subjected to a fluence of 2.6 x 1020 _n_/cm2 were collected and analyzed. The transition temperature, expected to be ~ 4 K based on the fluence, was 7.1 K for both inductive and specific-heat transitions. In addition, the transition width was narrow, indicating that the sample was probably heated to the temperature of onset of recovery during irradiation. However, the Th_D_  from stoichiometry. The normalized discontinuity \(\Delta C/\gamma T_{e}\) in V\({}_{3}\)Si decreased for high fluence but did not change appreciably for low fluence.[5] From resistivity and critical-field measurements, Ghosh and Strongin[8] predict reduced coupling in irradiated Nb\({}_{3}\)Al. Further work is in progress to resolve this question.

## V Conclusions

The specific heat of Nb\({}_{3}\)Al irradiated with fast neutrons has been measured. The superconducting transition temperature is depressed, and the transition width is broadened by radiation-induced disorder. Substantial lattice stiffening and only a slight reduction in the density of states are observed in the irradiated samples. No conclusive support for reduced electron-phonon coupling is apparent.
