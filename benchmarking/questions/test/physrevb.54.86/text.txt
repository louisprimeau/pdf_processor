###### Abstract

The effects of iodine intercalation have been investigated for the Co-substituted Bi-2212 phase Bi2Sr2Ca(Cu1-zCo2)2O8+d with different d values in the overdoped regime. Whereas in the pristine samples \(T_{c}\) depends on \(z\) and \(\delta\), in the intercalated ones \(T_{c}\) is independent of \(\delta\). This indicates that the hole concentration \(p\) in the Bi-2212 phase has an upper limit and becomes saturated by the transfer of holes from the intercalated iodine. \(T_{c}(z)/T_{c}(z\!=\!0)\) of the intercalated samples differs from that of the pristine ones. This suggests that the intercalation of iodine decreases \(T_{c}\) not only through an increase in \(p\), but also through a structural change, probably the interlayer decoupling between adjacent blocks of the CuO2 planes.

## 1 Introduction

High-\(T_{c}\) cuprates are mostly described in terms of Josephson-coupled two-dimensional CuO2 planes. It is widely known that the superconducting transition temperature \(T_{c}\) increases with the number of CuO2 planes per unit cell, \(n\), at least for \(n\!\leq\!3\). To explain this, several models have been proposed,[1, 2, 3] taking into account both intraplane properties and interplane coupling. In the Bi2Sr2Ca\({}_{n-1}\)Cu\({}_{n}\)O\({}_{2n+4}\) (\(n\!=\!1,\!2,\!3\)) system, it is known that the intercalation of atoms or molecules between the weakly coupled BiO-BiO double layers increases the \(c\) axis considerably, leaving the intraplane lattice parameters unchanged,[4, 5] In particular, intercalation of iodine into the Bi-2212 phase has been well established.[4, 6, 7] Then, the question has been raised whether the resulting decrease in \(T_{c}\) through iodine intercalation is due to decoupling of the CuO2 planes[8, 9] or due to transfer of holes from the intercalated iodine to the CuO2 planes.[10, 11]

Formerly, Fujiwara _et al.[7]_ approached this problem by mapping the \(T_{c}\)-x diagram of the intercalation compound Bi2Sr2Ca1-zYxCu2O8+d on that of the pristine compound Bi2Sr2Ca1-zYxCu2O8+d. They concluded that the change of the interlayer coupling leads to an overall decrease in \(T_{c}\), while the transfer of holes leads to a shift of the maximum \(T_{c}^{\rm max}\) towards lower \(x\) values.

In this paper, to approach the above problem in another way, we investigate the effects of iodine intercalation for the Co-substituted Bi-2212 phase Bi2Sr2Ca(Cu1-zCo2)2O8+d with different d values. Among possible substituents for Cu, Co has been chosen because of the comparatively large solubility.[12, 13]

## 2 Experimental details

Polycrystalline samples of Bi2Sr2Ca(Cu1-zCo2)2O8+d have been prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction method. Powders of Bi2O3, SrCO3, CaCO3, CuO, and CoO have been mixed in a stoichiometric ratio and were prefired at 800 degC. After pulverization, the prefired samples were pelletized and sintered in air for 24 h at 850 degC. The last step was repeated to obtain homogeneous samples. All samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). We could not detect impurity phases due to the Co substitution for \(z\!\!\leq\!0.02\). The oxygen content of the sintered samples was changed by subsequent annealing in flowing gas of N2 and O2 at 600 degC. From iodometry analysis and weight change, the oxygen content of the unsubstituted samples (\(z\!=\!0\)) was estimated to be \(\delta^{\rm\rm\infty}\)0.25 (as sintered), \(\delta^{\rm\rm\infty}\)0.19 (N2 annealed), and \(\delta^{\rm\rm\infty}\)0.28 (O2 annealed), respectively.

The intercalation of iodine was carried out by vapor-phase reaction in an evacuated glass tube,[6] at an iodine temperature \(T_{i}\) and a sample temperature \(T_{s}\) of \(T_{i}\!=\!T_{s}\!=\!150\) degC.

\(T_{c}\) was determined from resistivity measurements, choosing a 50% value of the normal resistivity at the superconducting transition as a criterion.

## 3 Results and discussion

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show typical XRD patterns of Bi2Sr2Ca(Cu1-zCo2)2O8+dYu with \(y\!=\!0\) and 1. It is found that the _c_-axis lattice parameter increases due to the intercalation from \(c\)/2\(=\!15.4\) A to \(c\!=\!19.0\) A by 3.6 A for all \(z\) values, while the _a_-axis parameter remains constant at 5.41 A . With increasing \(z\!>\!0.02\), growth of impurity peaks is observed in the XRD patterns. In the pristine samples, the main impurity peak is hidden underneath the (117) peak, virtually increasing its magnitude in comparison with the (115) and (200) peaks. The structural change through the intercalation shifts the (00_l_) peaks, so that the main impurity peak is no longer superposed in the intercalated samples.

From the weight change through intercalation, the iodine content \(y\) was determined to be \(y\!=\!1.0\pm 0.03\) for \(z\!\!\leq\!0.02\), as shown in Fig. 2. Regardless of the oxygen content, \(y\) decreases with increasing \(z\) for \(z\!\!>\!0.02\). This is consistent with the growth of impurity phases for \(z\!\!>\!0.02\), supposing that iodine can only enter the Bi-2212 phase, but not the impurity phases.

Figure 3 shows \(T_{c}\) vs \(z\) for pristine and intercalated samples with different oxygen contents. For pristine samples, \(T_{c0}\!=\!T_{c}(z\!=\!0)\) decreases with increasing \(\delta\) and hence with increasing hole concentration per Cu, \(p\). This demonstrates that these samples are located on the overdoped side of the \(T_{c}\)-\(p\) diagram, where \(T_{c}\) decreases upon hole doping.

With increasing \(z\), \(T_{c}\) decreases linearly until \(z\!=\!0.02\) for all samples with different \(\delta\) and \(y\) values. At this concentration a kink appears and the slope of \(T_{c}\) suppression decreases slightly. Since the growth of impurity phases is observed for \(z\!\!>\!0.02\), above this concentration Co atoms are concluded not to be fully incorporated into the Bi-2212 structure. Note that the slope \(|d\,T_{c}/dz|\), as well as \(T_{c0}\), is carrier dependent and decreases with increasing \(p\) for the pristine samples.

After intercalation, we find almost the same \(T_{c}\) for each concentration \(z\), regardless of the \(\delta\) value. For example, \(T_{c0}\!=\!51.1\!\pm\!0.6\) K after intercalation for all three types of pristine samples with \(z\!=\!0\). To examine the oxygen loss during the intercalation process, we treated the pristine samples with \(z\!=\!0\) and different \(\delta\) values under intercalation conditions, omitting, however, iodine. We observed an increase in \(T_{c}\) due to the oxygen loss, for the oxidized sample from \(T_{c0}\!=\!61.1\) K to \(73\) K and for the as-sintered sample from \(T_{c0}\!=\!68.9\) K to \(80\) K, while \(T_{c}\) remains unchanged for the oxygen-reduced samples as \(T_{c0}\!=\!92.9\) K. Although the samples clearly lose some oxygen during the intercalation process, this loss is insufficient to account for the observed \(\delta\) independence of \(T_{c}\) after intercalation. A possible explanation is that the transfer of holes from the intercalated iodine to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes is lower for samples with higher \(\delta\) values, keeping the value of \(p\) constant.[14] That is, the value of \(p\) in the Bi-2212 phase seems to have an upper limit and becomes saturated by the transfer of holes from the intercalated iodine, leading to the same \(T_{c}\). Such a behavior has already been observed for samples of the Bi-2212 phase, annealed under high pressures of O\({}_{2}\), where oxygen is considered to enter the samples as O\({}_{2}\) instead of O\({}^{2-}\) above \(\delta\)\({}^{\rm{m}}\!=\!0.3\).[15]

Figure 4 shows replotted data of \(T_{c}\) as \(T_{c}(z)/T_{c0}\) vs \(z\). For the pristine samples, all data points are located on a single curve, which is independent of \(\delta\), namely, \(p\). The intercalated samples, however, show a small but clear deviation towards stronger suppression. This can be seen even at low concentrations \(z\!\approx\!0.02\), where effects of the impurity phases can be excluded. The same deviation has been found using the diamagnetic onset of the ac susceptibility as a criterion for \(T_{c}\).

Recently, we reported on the existence of a scaling law, observed in overdoped high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates.[13] It was demonstrated that data with different \(p\) values, replotted as \(T_{c}(z)/T_{c0}\), fall onto a single curve for each substituent. That is, assuming that \(p\) does not change with \(z\), it was found that \(T_{c}(z)/T_{c0}\!\equiv\!T_{c}(p,z)/T_{c}(p,0)\!=\!g(z)\), where \(g(z)\) is the

For \(z\!\!\geq\!0.04\), impurity phases (marked by dots and a triangle) appear. In pristine samples, the main impurity peak (marked by a triangle) is hidden underneath the (117) peak of the Bi-2212 phase.

  \(p\)-independent scaling function depending only on the crystal structure and the substituent.

In the case of trivalent substituents such as Co\({}^{3+}\), \(p\) might decrease with increasing \(z\). We believe, however, that extra charges of the trivalent substituents are compensated by an increase of \(\delta\) in the overdoped Bi-2212 phase. This is supported from measurements of the thermoelectric power \(S\)(290 K),[16] which is sensitive to \(p\).[17] Even if there remain uncompensated extra charges, the effect will be absorbed into an effective suppression function \(g(z)\).

For Co-substituted pristine samples, as a matter of fact, the scaling holds good. Accordingly, the deviation of the intercalated samples from \(g(z)\) of the pristine ones means that the decrease in \(T_{c}\) through intercalation cannot be explained as being due to only the transfer of holes from the intercalated iodine to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes. It is said that the structural change through intercalation also affects \(T_{c}\).

Here, from a theoretical point of view, we discuss the deviation from \(g(z)\) for the intercalated samples. The scaling law in the overdoped regime has been understood,[13] based on the Abrikosov-Gorkov pair breaking theory[18] with slight modifications for superconductors with anisotropic gap symmetries like extended \(s\) wave and \(d\) wave. For these gaps, even nonmagnetic impurities are pair breaking[19, 20, 21] and \(T_{c}/T_{c0}\) is given for small \(z\) values by

\[\frac{T_{c}}{T_{c0}} = g(z) = 1 - \chi\frac{\pi}{4k_{B}}\frac{\Gamma_{N}}{T_{c0}},\] (1)

where \(\chi \approx 1\) is related to the gap anisotropy and \(\Gamma_{N}\)%\(z\) is the scattering parameter. The scaling law in the overdoped regime has been understood as being due to the compensation of the \(p\) dependence of \(T_{c0}\) by the \(p\) dependence of \(\Gamma_{N}\).[13] Then the deviation towards stronger suppression for the intercalated samples is simply explained as being due to a decrease in \(T_{c0}\) on account of the structural change, probably the interlayer decoupling between adjacent blocks of the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes, though we cannot rule out that \(\Gamma_{N}\) is also affected by the structural change.[22]

In conclusion, both charge transfer and decoupling of the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes have to be taken into account to understand the \(T_{c}\) suppression through iodine intercalation, which is consistent with former reports.[7, 23]
