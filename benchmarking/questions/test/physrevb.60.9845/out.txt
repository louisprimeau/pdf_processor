###### Abstract

We present a study of the thermoelectric coefficient L(T) of polycrystalline silver doped (Bi1.6Pb0.4)Sr2Ca3(Cu1-_x_Agx)4O12+_d_ samples. L(T) relates the thermopower S(T) with electrical conductivity, \sigma(T), and gives an indication of the influence of the order parameter fluctuations (OPF) on S(T) in the mean field region (MFR). The results of L(T) indicate that the critical behavior of S(T) above the superconducting transition is driven essentially by \sigma(T). These results suggest that, in the MFR, L(T) is not affected by thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter (OPF). The OPF effects show a bi-dimensional character in the entire MFR, which is not affected by Ag doping. For low Ag concentrations, the experimental data \Delta\sigma/\sigma_{\mu} fit well to the Lawrence-Doniach model for layered superconductors in the MFR. Furthermore, the behavior of \Delta L is nearly temperature independent. [S0163-1829(99)13533-1]

## Introduction

Since in the copper-oxide superconductors \xi(0) is typically two orders of magnitude smaller than in low temperature superconductors and the superconducting transition temperature (T_{C}) is one order of magnitude higher, order parameter fluctuations (OPF) can be observed at accessible temperatures close to T_{C}. Measurements of electrical resistivity \rho(T) and magnetic susceptibility \chi(T) show OPF effects even 10 K above the critical temperature.[12]

An important and still controversial aspect of the OPF effects in high temperature superconductors (HTSC) is related with their influence on the in-plane thermoelectric coefficient L(T), which relates the in-plane thermopower S(T) and the in plane \rho(T). Different experimental groups have reported an anomalous peak, sometimes very sharp, in S(T) of polycrystalline and single crystal HTSC samples near T_{C}. This anomaly however has not been observed in \rho(T) and therefore a strong critical divergence of L(T) near T_{C} attributed to intrinsic OPF effects would be observed.

On the other hand, some authors have suggested the existence of a relationship between the anomalous S(T) peak and sample inhomogeneities, temperature gradient inhomogeneities, or even experimental artifacts.[3, 4, 5] In the YBCO systems, in the case of fully oxygenated samples, some results indicate that the thermoelectric coefficient does not present any sharp critical divergence close and above T_{C}.[6, 7] In order to give some insight on the above fundamental questions, we discuss in this paper detailed measurements of the thermoelectric power S(T) and the electrical resistivity \rho(T) rounding above T_{C} of silver doped (BiPb)_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{12-\delta} (BCCCO) polycrystalline samples. We analyze the OPF effects on both magnitudes in terms of the existing theories.

## Experiment

Polycrystalline samples of nominal composition (Bi1.6Pb0.4)Sr2Ca3(Cu1-_x_Agx)4O12+_d_, BSCCO-2234, with 0 \Leftarrowx\Leftarrow0.1, were prepared by the solid-state reaction method using high purity powders of BiO2, PbO, SrO3, CaCO3, CuO, and AgNO3. The materials were ground thoroughly, preheated at 800 degC for 20 h and then grounded and pressed (9 ton/cm2) in the form of small pellets. Thereafter the pellets were sintered at 850 degC for 140 h in air and cooled with the furnace turned off.

The Ag doping affects the superconducting properties of the BSCCO-2234 system but does not affect the structure of high-T_{C} phase (110 K) as observed with x-ray diffraction. An increasing of the critical current density (\mathbf{J}_{C}) was observed for x<0.01 and could be associated to microstructural changes. Part of Ag segregates on the BSCCO grain boundaries. This effect can either increase the contact surface between grains by decreasing the grain size or change the weak link type. Larger doping levels (x>0.01) inhibit the formation of the high-T_{C} phase (110 K) and decrease J_{C}. For x>0.01 the x-ray diffraction patterns display both multiphase samples (110 K, 80 K, and nonsuperconducting) and Ag diffractive peaks, which increase by increasing x.[8]

The electrical resistivity measurements were carried out by the four probe dc method, while the thermoelectric data were obtained using the differential technique with a temperature gradient, \Delta T\approx 0.1 K across the sample. The temperature was monitored with calibrated copper-constantan thermocules. Pt-100 sensors were used to know and control the bare temperature for each measured point. All voltages were measured using a Keithly nanovoltmeter model 182 with a resolution of 0.05 \muV. The estimated absolute accuracy of the TEP is \sim3%.[9, 10]

## Results and Discussion

For small thermal gradients the thermoelectric power and the electrical conductivity are related by the thermoelectric coefficient L(T), which is defined by[11, 12]

\[L(T) \equiv S(T)\sigma(T).\] (1)

Therefore in the presence of order parameter fluctuations the measurements of S(T) can be directly affected by \sigma(T) or  L(T). In order to analyze the rounding effects on S(T) and \rho(T) close above the transition temperature and the influence of OPF on S(\varepsilon),\ \sigma(\varepsilon), and L(\varepsilon), it is necessary to determine and quantify the corresponding excess D\sigma, D\rho, and DL, which are defined as [13]

\[\Delta S(\varepsilon) = S(\varepsilon) - S_{B}(\varepsilon),\]

\[\Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) = \sigma(\varepsilon) - \sigma_{B}(\varepsilon),\]

\[\Delta L(\varepsilon) = L(\varepsilon) - L_{B}(\varepsilon),\]

where e is the reduced temperature defined as e = ln(_T_/_T_/CS)  \approx(T - T_{CS})/_T_/_CS_, in the case of the thermopower and e  \approx(T - T_{C_{P}})/_T_/_CP_ in the case of resistivity. T_{S} and _T__C__P_ are the temperatures where \rho(T) and S(T) near the superconducting transition have the inflection point. For each sample the difference between T_{S} and _T__C__P_ is less than 0.3 K, which can be attributed to experimental errors (hereafter referred to as T_{C}).

The excess thermopower, DS(\varepsilon), close and above T_{C} is calculated from the difference between measured thermopower, S(\varepsilon), and the extrapolated one, S_{B}(\varepsilon), to low temperatures from the region where the OPF effects are not present. In our case we use a possible S(T) functional form in the normal region far away from the transition temperature in order to diminish one of the largest uncertainty causes. This uncertainty is related to the thermopower background choice and due to the absence of an unambiguous functional form for S(T) in the normal region of HTSC. After several polynomial fittings to our experimental results we have concluded that in the range 150 K  \approx T  \approx 250 K, S(T) discomposes mainly in two terms s(T) = \alpha T + \beta/T, i.e., higher order terms are negligible [see Fig. 1(a)]. The first term \alpha T is attributed to the carrier diffusion and the second one, proportional to 1/T, has been associated with the phonon drag but it should obviously include more than one contribution. [9, 10] The main characteristic of the S(T) curves for each sample are displayed in Table 1. In a similar form the measured resistivity \rho(T) above T_{C} (in the normal state) in zero applied magnetic field can be well described for all samples, Fig. 1(b), as \rho_{B}(T) = c + dT. This expression represents the resistivity of each sample in the normal state above 150 K, only the slopes and the constant terms varied from sample to sample (Table 1).

Figure 1 shows additionally the behavior of S(T) [Fig. 1(a)] and \rho(T) [Fig. 1(b)] in the background and the mean field region respectively. In our case the mean field region (MFR) lay between e \sim 0.03 and e \sim 0.18, i.e., in the reduced temperature range where the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau like approaches and the Gaussian approximations for OPF in zero magnetic field are expected to be valid. [13, 14]

The enhancement in the electrical conductivity D\sigma(\varepsilon) is defined as the difference between measured conductivity \sigma(\varepsilon) and \sigma_{B}(\varepsilon). The later one is the extrapolation to zero temperature from the straight line trend of the normal region (150 \approx T  \approx 250 K), with \sigma_{B}(T) \equiv 1/\sigma_{B}(T).

Then DL(\varepsilon) can be related with the corresponding excess DS(\varepsilon) and D\sigma(\varepsilon) by

\[\Delta L(\varepsilon) = S_{B}(\varepsilon)\Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) + \sigma(\varepsilon)\Delta S(\varepsilon),\]

which can be rewritten as

\[\frac{\Delta L(\varepsilon)}{L_{B}(\varepsilon)} = \frac{\Delta\sigma(\varepsilon)}{\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon)} - \frac{\sigma(\varepsilon)}{\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon)}\frac{\Delta S( \varepsilon)}{S_{B}(\varepsilon)}.\]

From the experimental results we observe that the dependence of DS(\varepsilon) and D\sigma(\varepsilon) with the reduced temperature is similar for all samples in all the MFR, Fig. 2. However the

These results confirm that _S_(_T_) is less sensitive than _r_(_T_) to the structural changes produced by Ag doping. On the other hand, in contrast with the changes in amplitude, the experimental data show that the changes in the _S_(_T_) behavior are more evident from sample to sample than those in _r_(_T_). This result can be associated to a higher sensitivity of _S_(_T_) to short length, compositional or structural, inhomogeneities at interatomic scales.3,13,16,17

Figure 3 shows the behavior of the thermoelectric coefficient D_L_(_e_) for different silver concentrations. D_L_(_e_) is approximately temperature independent, within the experimental uncertainty, which suggests that _L_(_T_) is not affected by thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, i.e., all the critical effects observed in _S_(_T_) above the superconducting transition are mainly due to _s_(_e_). Assuming that our samples have different structural inhomogeneities generated by the silver addition, they do not affect significantly the behavior of D_L_(_e_). Similar results have been obtained for other authors in well-oxygenated YBCO superconducting samples characterized by structural inhomogeneities at large length scales.6,19

It is worthwhile to note that in addition to the fact that _L_(_e_) is not affected within the experimental resolution by the presence of superconducting order parameter fluctuations in the MFR, a slight increase of the amplitude D_L_ as increasing x is observed (see Fig. 3). This behavior would be confirmed also by the fact that _r_(_T_) is more sensitive to the structural inhomogeneities produced in this case by the silver addition.3,15-18

## Comparison with the existing theories

The effect of the OPF on electrical conductivity _s_(_T_) on layered superconductors in the clean limit is determined by the theoretical approximation of Lawrence-Doniach:1,20

\[\Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) = \frac{A_{\sigma}}{\varepsilon}\left[ {1 + \frac{B_{\text{LD}}}{\varepsilon}} \right]^{- 1/2},\]

where _B_LD is the so-called Lawrence-Doniach coefficient which is defined by

\[B_{\text{LD}} = \left\langle {\frac{2\,\xi_{C}(0)}{s}} \right\rangle^{2},\]

where _x_C (0) is the _c_-axis direction coherence length (at T = 0 K), and s is the distance between superconducting planes. The system dimensionality is controlled by _B_LD parameter. _A_s_ is an important amplitude which depends on the pairing state, the number n of the real components of the order parameter, and the number N of superconducting layers per unit cell of length s. This can be expressed as _A_s_or = _g_NA_AL, where g is the number of complex components of

  the superconducting order parameter and A_{\rm{AL}}\!=\!e^{2}/16\hbar\,s is the universal Aslamazov-Larkin and Lawrence-Doniach conductivity.

The dotted lines in Figs. 4(a)-4(d) are the best fits of Eq. (5) to \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon)/\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon) in the MFR for each sample with A_{\sigma} and B_{\rm{LD}} as free parameters (see Table 2). Additionally to the good qualitative agreement with the experimental data, the values of B_{\rm{LD}}(B_{\rm{LD}}\!\!<\!\!e) lead to a two-dimensional character (2D) for the fluctuations of the order parameter. These results are in agreement with that obtained in BSCCO samples from paraconductivity measurements.[21] Furthermore the values obtained for B_{\rm{LD}} show that low Ag doping levels (0<x<0.005) do not affect significantly the dimensionality of the system. However, the general behavior observed for samples with x>0.005 shows that there is not agreement between experimental data and Eq. (5), showing both a change in the dependence of \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) with \varepsilon and an increasing of the amplitude of \Delta\sigma (see Fig. 5). The behavior of \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) with reduced temperature seem to be due to a possible increase of the critical region and the consequence decrease of MFR. Other effects like that produced by the presence of Maki-Thomson processes could be present, and contribute to the decreasing of MFR.[22, 23, 24]

The effect of OPF on the thermoelectric coefficient as given by the theoretical approximation proposed by Maki for s-wave layered superconductors in the clean limit is[6, 13]

\[\Delta L\!=\!A_{L}\ln\!\left[\frac{2}{\varepsilon(1+\alpha\!+\!\sqrt{1+2\, \alpha})}\right]\!,\] (7)

where \alpha\!=\!B_{\rm{LD}}/2\varepsilon.

The full line in Fig. 4(a) is the best fit of Eq. (7) to the experimental data, \Delta L(\varepsilon), in MFR using the B_{\rm{LD}} values obtained from LD fit to \Delta\sigma/\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon) data (Table 2). The results indicate that the model proposed by Maki accounts reasonably well with our experimental data for low Ag-doped levels of BSCCO-2234 samples. The temperature dependence of \Delta L(\varepsilon) is soft and their amplitude is small. In other words as this result is found for low Ag-doped samples (0 \leqx\leq0.005) with different structural changes, we could conclude that this behavior is intrinsic to BSCCO-2234 samples.

Let us stress here however, that the reasonable agreement between experimental data and the Maki model does not allow us to conclude about the pairing state of the order parameter. Within the experimental resolution and since amplitude of L(\varepsilon) is very small compared with \sigma\Delta S(\varepsilon) in the MFR any soft functional form of the order parameter could fit reasonably well the experimental data.

Studies of the magnetic field dependence of the thermoelectric coefficient below T_{C} might provide a deeper insight into the symmetry of the gap parameter.[25] Results on this subject will be analyzed in a forthcoming paper.

## Conclusions

For low-Ag doped (0\leqx\leq0.005) BSCCO-2234 samples the behavior with reduced temperature of S(\varepsilon) and \sigma(\varepsilon) is similar for all samples and independent of Ag addition. However, the changes in the amplitude of \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) are larger than in \Delta S(\varepsilon). Which confirm that S(T) is less sensitive than \rho(T) to the inhomogeneities produced by Ag doping.

The OPF effects on the S(T) are driven mainly by \sigma(T) because L is nearly temperature independent, i.e., the inhomogeneities generated by the silver addition do not affect substantially the behavior of L(\varepsilon) in all MFR.

There exist an excellent agreement between the experimental results obtained for \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon)/\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon) and the model proposed by LD. The fluctuations of the order parameter (OPF) in MFR are substantially of two-dimensional character for low doping levels. The changes in \Delta L(\varepsilon) in MFR are soft and their amplitude is small in agreement with the model proposed by Maki for layered s-wave type superconductors. The experimental resolution and the very small amplitude of L(\varepsilon) in the MFR do not allow a definite conclusion about the pairing state of the order parameter.

For high Ag-doping level x>0.005, the experimental values of \Delta\sigma/\sigma_{B} are not in agreement with the LD model. This behavior could be associated with the presence of other effects like Maki-Thomson process.

In a similar form the measured resistivity \rho(T) above T_{C} (in the normal state) in zero applied magnetic field can be well described for all samples, Fig. 1(b), as \rho_{B}(T) = c + dT. This expression represents the resistivity of each sample in the normal state above 150 K, only the slopes and the constant terms varied from sample to sample (Table 1).

Figure 1 shows additionally the behavior of S(T) [Fig. 1(a)] and \rho(T) [Fig. 1(b)] in the background and the mean field region respectively. In our case the mean field region (MFR) lay between e \sim 0.03 and e \sim 0.18, i.e., in the reduced temperature range where the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau like approaches and the Gaussian approximations for OPF in zero magnetic field are expected to be valid. [13, 14]

The enhancement in the electrical conductivity D\sigma(\varepsilon) is defined as the difference between measured conductivity \sigma(\varepsilon) and \sigma_{B}(\varepsilon). The later one is the extrapolation to zero temperature from the straight line trend of the normal region (150 \approx T  \approx 250 K), with \sigma_{B}(T) \equiv 1/\sigma_{B}(T).

Then DL(\varepsilon) can be related with the corresponding excess DS(\varepsilon) and D\sigma(\varepsilon) by

\[\Delta L(\varepsilon) = S_{B}(\varepsilon)\Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) + \sigma(\varepsilon)\Delta S(\varepsilon),\]

which can be rewritten as

\[\frac{\Delta L(\varepsilon)}{L_{B}(\varepsilon)} = \frac{\Delta\sigma(\varepsilon)}{\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon)} - \frac{\sigma(\varepsilon)}{\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon)}\frac{\Delta S( \varepsilon)}{S_{B}(\varepsilon)}.\]

From the experimental results we observe that the dependence of DS(\varepsilon) and D\sigma(\varepsilon) with the reduced temperature is similar for all samples in all the MFR, Fig. 2. However the

These results confirm that _S_(_T_) is less sensitive than _r_(_T_) to the structural changes produced by Ag doping. On the other hand, in contrast with the changes in amplitude, the experimental data show that the changes in the _S_(_T_) behavior are more evident from sample to sample than those in _r_(_T_). This result can be associated to a higher sensitivity of _S_(_T_) to short length, compositional or structural, inhomogeneities at interatomic scales.3,13,16,17

Figure 3 shows the behavior of the thermoelectric coefficient D_L_(_e_) for different silver concentrations. D_L_(_e_) is approximately temperature independent, within the experimental uncertainty, which suggests that _L_(_T_) is not affected by thermodynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, i.e., all the critical effects observed in _S_(_T_) above the superconducting transition are mainly due to _s_(_e_). Assuming that our samples have different structural inhomogeneities generated by the silver addition, they do not affect significantly the behavior of D_L_(_e_). Similar results have been obtained for other authors in well-oxygenated YBCO superconducting samples characterized by structural inhomogeneities at large length scales.6,19

It is worthwhile to note that in addition to the fact that _L_(_e_) is not affected within the experimental resolution by the presence of superconducting order parameter fluctuations in the MFR, a slight increase of the amplitude D_L_ as increasing x is observed (see Fig. 3). This behavior would be confirmed also by the fact that _r_(_T_) is more sensitive to the structural inhomogeneities produced in this case by the silver addition.3,15-18

## Comparison with the existing theories

The effect of the OPF on electrical conductivity _s_(_T_) on layered superconductors in the clean limit is determined by the theoretical approximation of Lawrence-Doniach:1,20

\[\Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) = \frac{A_{\sigma}}{\varepsilon}\left[ {1 + \frac{B_{\text{LD}}}{\varepsilon}} \right]^{- 1/2},\]

where _B_LD is the so-called Lawrence-Doniach coefficient which is defined by

\[B_{\text{LD}} = \left\langle {\frac{2\,\xi_{C}(0)}{s}} \right\rangle^{2},\]

where _x_C (0) is the _c_-axis direction coherence length (at T = 0 K), and s is the distance between superconducting planes. The system dimensionality is controlled by _B_LD parameter. _A_s_ is an important amplitude which depends on the pairing state, the number n of the real components of the order parameter, and the number N of superconducting layers per unit cell of length s. This can be expressed as _A_s_or = _g_NA_AL, where g is the number of complex components of

  the superconducting order parameter and A_{\rm{AL}}\!=\!e^{2}/16\hbar\,s is the universal Aslamazov-Larkin and Lawrence-Doniach conductivity.

The dotted lines in Figs. 4(a)-4(d) are the best fits of Eq. (5) to \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon)/\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon) in the MFR for each sample with A_{\sigma} and B_{\rm{LD}} as free parameters (see Table 2). Additionally to the good qualitative agreement with the experimental data, the values of B_{\rm{LD}}(B_{\rm{LD}}\!\!<\!\!e) lead to a two-dimensional character (2D) for the fluctuations of the order parameter. These results are in agreement with that obtained in BSCCO samples from paraconductivity measurements.[21] Furthermore the values obtained for B_{\rm{LD}} show that low Ag doping levels (0<x<0.005) do not affect significantly the dimensionality of the system. However, the general behavior observed for samples with x>0.005 shows that there is not agreement between experimental data and Eq. (5), showing both a change in the dependence of \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) with \varepsilon and an increasing of the amplitude of \Delta\sigma (see Fig. 5). The behavior of \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) with reduced temperature seem to be due to a possible increase of the critical region and the consequence decrease of MFR. Other effects like that produced by the presence of Maki-Thomson processes could be present, and contribute to the decreasing of MFR.[22, 23, 24]

The effect of OPF on the thermoelectric coefficient as given by the theoretical approximation proposed by Maki for s-wave layered superconductors in the clean limit is[6, 13]

\[\Delta L\!=\!A_{L}\ln\!\left[\frac{2}{\varepsilon(1+\alpha\!+\!\sqrt{1+2\, \alpha})}\right]\!,\] (7)

where \alpha\!=\!B_{\rm{LD}}/2\varepsilon.

The full line in Fig. 4(a) is the best fit of Eq. (7) to the experimental data, \Delta L(\varepsilon), in MFR using the B_{\rm{LD}} values obtained from LD fit to \Delta\sigma/\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon) data (Table 2). The results indicate that the model proposed by Maki accounts reasonably well with our experimental data for low Ag-doped levels of BSCCO-2234 samples. The temperature dependence of \Delta L(\varepsilon) is soft and their amplitude is small. In other words as this result is found for low Ag-doped samples (0 \leqx\leq0.005) with different structural changes, we could conclude that this behavior is intrinsic to BSCCO-2234 samples.

Let us stress here however, that the reasonable agreement between experimental data and the Maki model does not allow us to conclude about the pairing state of the order parameter. Within the experimental resolution and since amplitude of L(\varepsilon) is very small compared with \sigma\Delta S(\varepsilon) in the MFR any soft functional form of the order parameter could fit reasonably well the experimental data.

Studies of the magnetic field dependence of the thermoelectric coefficient below T_{C} might provide a deeper insight into the symmetry of the gap parameter.[25] Results on this subject will be analyzed in a forthcoming paper.

## Conclusions

For low-Ag doped (0\leqx\leq0.005) BSCCO-2234 samples the behavior with reduced temperature of S(\varepsilon) and \sigma(\varepsilon) is similar for all samples and independent of Ag addition. However, the changes in the amplitude of \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon) are larger than in \Delta S(\varepsilon). Which confirm that S(T) is less sensitive than \rho(T) to the inhomogeneities produced by Ag doping.

The OPF effects on the S(T) are driven mainly by \sigma(T) because L is nearly temperature independent, i.e., the inhomogeneities generated by the silver addition do not affect substantially the behavior of L(\varepsilon) in all MFR.

There exist an excellent agreement between the experimental results obtained for \Delta\sigma(\varepsilon)/\sigma_{B}(\varepsilon) and the model proposed by LD. The fluctuations of the order parameter (OPF) in MFR are substantially of two-dimensional character for low doping levels. The changes in \Delta L(\varepsilon) in MFR are soft and their amplitude is small in agreement with the model proposed by Maki for layered s-wave type superconductors. The experimental resolution and the very small amplitude of L(\varepsilon) in the MFR do not allow a definite conclusion about the pairing state of the order parameter.

For high Ag-doping level x>0.005, the experimental values of \Delta\sigma/\sigma_{B} are not in agreement with the LD model. This behavior could be associated with the presence of other effects like Maki-Thomson process.
