###### Abstract

We characterize the superconducting state of the carbides \({\rm YC}_{2}\), \({\rm Y}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)C\({}_{2}\), and \({\rm Y}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)C\({}_{2}\) (0<_x_ <= 0.3) by means of magnetization and specific-heat measurements. \({\rm YC}_{2}\) is a superconductor with \(T_{c}\) = 4.02(5) K. Partial substitution with Ca and Th, as well as doping with the strongly pair breaking Gd, reduces the critical temperature. Isothermal magnetization measurements on \({\rm YC}_{2}\) indicate a superconducting behavior close to the type-I limit with _B__c_2(0) = 59(2) mT. Specific-heat data of \({\rm YC}_{2}\), \({\rm Y}_{0.8}\)Th\({}_{0.2}\)C\({}_{2}\), and \({\rm Y}_{0.0}\)Ca\({}_{0.1}\)C\({}_{2}\) are analyzed in terms of weak-coupling BCS theory and the \(\alpha\) model. The comparison with the model predictions as well as the \({}^{12}\)C/\({}^{13}\)C-isotope effect on \(T_{c}\) indicate excellent agreement with weak-coupling BCS theory for \({\rm YC}_{2}\). A strong dependence of the superconducting properties on the carbon deficiency is observed. We describe high-temperature annealing procedures to optimize the superconducting properties of the samples. _Ab initio_ calculations of the electronic band structure using the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital atomic-sphere approximation method are presented and the density of states at the Fermi energy is discussed in view of the experimental Pauli susceptibilities and heat-capacity results.

## 1 Introduction

Interest in the properties of superconducting lanthanoid carbides has recently increased due to the discovery of superconductivity with transition temperatures up to 23 K in the Ni and Pd-based borocarbide families [1, 2, 3] and also because of the observation of superconductivity with \(T_{c}\) up to 11.6 K in layered rare-earth carbide halides. [4, 5, 6, 7]

Binary and quasibinary lanthanoid (_Ln_) carbides, especially Th substituted sesquicarbides of yttrium and lanthanum, _Ln_2C3. [8] had attracted particular attention more than a decade prior to the discovery of superconducting cuprates because their transition temperatures reached values close to those of niobium based \(A\)15-type Nb3\(X\) compounds. [9] Lanthanoid dicarbides _Ln_C2 (_Ln_ = Y, La), which crystallize in the body-centered-tetragonal CaC2 structure type [10] (see Fig. 1), exhibit lower transition temperatures. For example, Giorgi _et al._ detected superconductivity in \({\rm YC}_{2}\) at 3.88 K. [11] Apart from reports on the appearance of superconductivity, however, to the best of our knowledge, further detailed investigations concerning the superconducting properties of \({\rm YC}_{2}\) have not been carried out since. [12, 13, 14, 8]

Stimulated by the interest in the layered yttrium-carbide-halide superconductors, [4, 5, 6, 7] with crystal structures and chemical bonding properties closely related to those of the lanthanoid dicarbides, [15, 16] we have carried out a detailed study of the superconducting properties of samples of \({\rm YC}_{2}\), \({\rm Y}_{1-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)C\({}_{2}\), and \({\rm Y}_{1-x}\)Ca\({}_{x}\)C\({}_{2}\) (0<_x_ <= 0.3) by specific-heat and dc-magnetization measurements. [17] The analysis of the magnetization and specific-heat experiments as well as of the \({}^{12}\)C/\({}^{13}\)C-isotope effect on \(T_{c}\) of \({\rm YC}_{2}\) reveals that these compounds behave as nearly ideal weak-coupling BCS superconductors. Th and Ca substitution reduces \(T_{c}\), and the maximal \(T_{c}\) is therefore observed for compounds with the ideal composition of \({\rm YC}_{2}\).

The electronic properties in the normal state have been studied by measuring the Pauli susceptibility and the specific heat of the conduction electrons. The experimentally determined electronic density of states at the Fermi energy is enhanced by Th substitution but lowered by Ca substitution.

Tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital atomic-sphere approximation (TB-LMTO-ASA) calculations of the electronic band structure are presented and the electronic densities of states at the Fermi energy are discussed in view of the experimental results and electron-phonon coupling parameters are derived. Our investigations reveal a strong influence of the carbon deficiency on the superconducting properties of the yttrium dicarbides. Special high-temperature annealing procedures were employed to optimize the superconducting properties of our samples.

## II Experimental

### Sample preparation

Pellets of about 1 g of \({\rm YC}_{\rm 2}\) and the Th-substituted yttrium-dicarbides (Y,Th)C\({}_{\rm 2}\) were prepared by arc-melting stoichiometric quantities of coarse chips of yttrium metal (Johnson Matthey Inc., 99.99%), thorium metal (Goodfellow Inc., 99.5%) and graphite (Deutsche Carbone, 99.99%) in a purified argon atmosphere. \({}^{13}\)C (Chemotrade, enrichment 99%) was purchased in form of an amorphous powder. After melting the sample pellets were sealed in tantalum crucibles and annealed in an induction furnace to temperatures between 1200 and 2300 K.

\({\rm CaC}_{\rm 2}\) was prepared from a mixture of distilled calcium (99.8%) and a slight excess of graphite powder. The thoroughly mixed powders were pressed into a tantalum crucible and heated to 1400 K. The Ca-substituted samples \({\rm Y}_{\rm 1-,x}{\rm Ca}_{\rm 2}\)(\(x\)\(\leq\)0.3) were prepared by heating a pressed pellet of a mixture of appropriate amounts of powders of \({\rm YC}_{\rm 2}\) and \({\rm CaC}_{\rm 2}\) to 2000 K for several times followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis confirmed the molar ratio of the constituents. X-ray powder diffraction proved single-phase samples which all crystallized in the body-centered-tetragonal \({\rm CaC}_{\rm 2}\)-structure type. [10]

### Magnetization measurements

Measurements of the dc-magnetizations were performed with a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design). The moisture sensitive samples were sealed in quartz glass sample tubes designed to give a negligible background signal. The sample tubes were filled with helium exchange gas to provide sufficient thermal contact. Diamagnetic shielding [zero-field cooled (zfc) susceptibility] and Meissner effect [field-cooled (fc) susceptibility] were measured in external magnetic fields of 1 mT.

The Pauli susceptibilities were determined from high-field (1 T\(\rightleftharpoons\mu_{0}H\)\(\approx\)5 T) susceptibility measurements applying the Honda-Owen extrapolation method [18] to correct for ferromagnetic impurities, a Curie-type correction for the susceptibility of paramagnetic impurities and the correction for closed-shell diamagnetism.

### Specific-heat measurements

The heat capacities \(c_{p}(T)\) were measured by a quasiadiabatic heat pulse method in a vacuum calorimeter. The samples were mounted onto a sapphire platform with a thin layer of Apiezon-N grease. Powder samples were sealed under 1 bar \({}^{4}\)He exchange gas into Duran capsules with a flat bottom face.

The heat capacities of the addenda (sample holder and Duran capsule) were determined in separate runs and subtracted. The absolute errors of the \(c_{p}(T)\) data for \({\rm YC}_{\rm 2}\) (sample 2a, 1.588 g) are of the order of 1% or better, while they are somewhat larger for the data of the powder samples.

## III Electronic structure calculations

The colorless insulating calcium carbide, \({\rm CaC}_{\rm 2}\), can be considered as the prototype ionic carbide. Its structure contains \({\rm C}_{\rm 2}\) units bonded via C\(\rightleftharpoons\)C triple bonds (\(d_{{\rm C}-{\rm c}}\)\(=\)120 pm) in agreement with the formulation as \({\rm Ca}_{\rm 2}^{\rm 2+}{\rm C}_{\rm 2}^{\rm 2-}\). In a molecular view, all bonding \(p\) orbitals of the \({\rm C}_{\rm 2}\) unit are filled and separated by a large energy gap from the empty, antibonding \(\pi\)* and \(\sigma\)* orbitals. The additional electron in \({\rm YC}_{\rm 2}\) enters the lowest-lying \(\pi\)* orbitals which, together with the \({\rm Y}\)\(d\) states, form the conduction band. [19, 20, 21, 22]

The electronic structure of \({\rm YC}_{\rm 2}\) was calculated _ab initio_ using the self-consistent TB-LMTO-ASA method. [23] A local exchange-correlation potential was used [24] and all relativistic effects were included except for the spin-orbit coupling. The LMTO method has been described fully elsewhere [23, 25] and we shall therefore only give some technical data of the calculations in Table 1.

In this table the inclusion of a partial wave (\(s\)\(\sim\) angular momentum 0, \(p\)\(\sim\) 1, and so on) in the LMTO basis set is indicated by an \(l\) (meaning low) and an included partial wave, which has been down folded is indicated by an \(i\) (meaning intermediate). \(S\) is the sphere radius in atomic units and \(E1\) and \(E2\) stand for interstitial spheres, which had to be inserted in order that the volume of all spheres in the unit cell equals the unit-cell volume. No overlap between two atomic centered spheres exceeded 16% and the overlap between an atomic sphere and an interstitial sphere did not exceed 18%. The interstitial spheres were located at the **a**/2 + **c**/4 and 0.2660**b** + e/3 equivalent positions, respectively. The sphere radii and the positions of the interstitial spheres were determined by an automatic algorithm developed by Krier _et al._[26] We used 1063 irreducible points in all tetrahedron **k**-space integrations. [27]

The calculated electronic structure along some symmetry lines in the body-centered tetragonal Brillouin zone is shown in Fig. 2. The corresponding density of states is shown in Fig. 3 and is in qualitatively good agreement with that of Zhukov _et al._[28] The energy bands may be understood using the orbital decoration technique. [29] The two lowest bands at around \(-\)14 and \(-\)6 eV (\(E_{\rm F}\)\(=\) 0 eV) are the bonding and antibonding combinations of the carbon \(s\) orbitals, respectively. The bonding combination of the two \(p_{x}\) and the two \(p_{y}\) orbitals form the two degenerate bands from \(\Gamma\) to \(Z\) around \(-\)3 eV, which split up in two bands away from this symmetry line. The fifth band at \(Z\) is due to the bonding combination of the two \(p_{z}\) orbitals. This hybridizes strongly with the higher lying \({\rm Y}\)\(d_{{\rm 3}^{\rm 2-}1}\) orbitals and therefore contributes to the metal carbon bonding. All these bands are completely filled and they therefore contain 10 of the 11 valence electrons. The remaining electron is shared between the \({\rm Y}\)\(d_{{\rm x}^{\rm 2-}2}\) orbitals, which form a strongly dispersive band in planes perpendicular to the **c** direction with a small electron pocket around \(Z\) [\(=\)(2 \(\pi\)/a,0,0), not shown in Fig. 3], and combinations of \({\rm Y}\)\(d_{{\rm x}z}\), \(d_{{\rm y}z}\), antibonding \({\rm C}\)\(p_{x}\), and anti

 bonding C \(p_{y}\) orbitals. The latter combination provides hopping between the YC 2 planes, and the corresponding bands consequently are strongly dispersive in the **c** direction. The density of states per formula unit at the Fermi level is _N_(\(E_{F}\)) = 0.34 states eV-1 spin-1. Using a rigid-band picture the densities for the thorium substituted compounds Y1-_x_Th_x_C2 are estimated to be 0.35, 0.38, and 0.40 states eV-1 spin-1 for \(x\) = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. The lattice expansion induced by Th substitution is very small, and it is estimated to reduce _N_(\(E_{F}\)) by 0.7, 1.4, and 2.1 % for \(x\) = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. For the calcium-substituted compounds Y1-_x_Ca_C2, _N_(\(E_{F}\)) is calculated to be 0.34, 0.33, and 0.31 states eV-1 spin-1 for \(x\) = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively.

## IV Results and Discussion

### Sample characterization

Table 2 compiles the crystallographic and the superconducting properties of our samples. A central result of our investigation is the finding that the properties, and in particular the superconducting critical temperature, depend very sensitively on the carbon content of the samples. Proper heat treatment (see below) of the stoichiometric YC 2 samples results in superconductors with a sharp transition and transition temperatures up to 4.02 +- 0.05 K (onset temperature, sample _2a_). This temperature is somewhat higher than the \(T_{c}\) of 3.88 K reported previously for YC 2 by Giorgi _et al._11 The increased transition temperatures are observed only after heating the samples to 2300 K followed by a subsequent slow cooling to 1200 K at a rate of 50 K/h. For samples treated in this way the lattice parameters \(a\) and \(c\) are found to be largest. Rapid cooling, even of stoichiometric YC 2 samples, leads to a reduction of \(T_{c}\) to ~ 3.86 K and a visible decrease of the lattice parameters, as well. We attribute this observation to local carbon defects which are induced by heating the samples to high temperatures and frozen in when subsequently quenching the samples from 2300 K to room temperature. The carbon excess is assumed to precipitate at the boundaries between YC 2-_x_ grains.

Intentional reduction of the carbon content (samples 3 and 4) leads to a rapid, almost linear, decrease of \(T_{c}\) with the carbon deficiency, ~ 0.1 K/% C (cf. Fig. 4), as well as a decrease of the lattice parameters, which is more pronounced for the \(c\) axis. The lattice parameters therefore are a sensitive indicator for the carbon content of the samples. The reduced carbon content, apparently, leads to a partial replacement of C2 units by single C atoms as is also evidenced by a detailed investigation of the hydrolysis reaction of YC 2-_x_ showing an increase of methane species in the hydrolysis products.30,31

A substitution of Y in YC 2 with Th or Ca results in compounds which, up to 30% substitution, still exhibit the CaC 2

  structure. The lattice parameters closely follow Vegard's law indicating a full assimilation of the dopants. All Th- or Ca-substituted samples consistently show lower superconducting transition temperatures in contrast to the Y 2 C3 system, where replacement of Y by Th leads to a significant increase of \(T_{c}\). [8] Substitution of magnetic rare-earth atoms like, e.g., Gd for Y in YC 2, as well, induces a dramatic decrease of \(T_{c}\) (cf. Fig. 4).

The magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a sharp transition to superconductivity with \(\Delta\)_T__c_/_T__c_ [_m_ = 1-2 % for all samples. The diamagnetic shielding is complete while the Meissner-effect fraction typically is found between 10 and 70 %, depending on the annealing conditions (cf. Fig. 5).

### Isotope effect

The shift of the superconducting transition temperature of YC 2 induced through the replacement of the natural mixture of C isotopes (98.9% 12C) by isotopically enriched 13C was studied on two samples which showed lattice parameters which within error bars were identical to those of the Y 12C2 samples. The 12C/13C isotope effect on \(T_{c}\) of YC 2 amounts to (cf. inset Fig. 5)

\[\Delta\)\(T_{c}\) = - 0.17(2) K, which corresponds to an isotope exponent of

\[\alpha = 0.51(7)\]

in very good agreement with the prediction of weak-coupling BCS theory.

### Pauli susceptibility

Figure 6 displays the molar susceptibility _kh_mol(_T_,\(m\)0_H_ - ) for YC 1.95 (sample 3) which is typical for all samples under investigation. Each data point was obtained from the extrapolation, \(m\)0_H_ - , of a set of field-dependent magnetic-susceptibility measurements carried out at constant temperature (Honda-Owen method [18]).

Above 100 K the magnetic susceptibilities of all investigated samples can be fitted very well to a modified Curie law (see Fig. 6)

\[\chi_{\rm mol} = C/T + \chi_{0}\]

The Curie term _C/T_ accounts for magnetic impurities which were found to amount to 0.25% or less of spin \(S\) = 1/2 entities per formula unit. The temperature-independent part, _kh_0, represents the sum of the conduction electron paramagnetism ("Pauli susceptibility") _kh_P_uni and of the diamagnetism of the closed shells _kh_dia:

\[\chi_{0} = \chi_{\rm Pauli} + \chi_{\rm dia}\]

\[\chi_{\rm dia}\]

 was calculated using the increments for the particular ions: [32] \[{\rm Y}^{3 + } : - 12 \times 10^{- 6}\,\,{\rm emu}\,{\rm mol}^{- 1},\,\,{\rm Ca}^{2 + } : - 8 \times 10^{- 6}\,\,{\rm emu}\,{\rm mol}^{- 1},\,\,{\rm and}\,\,{\rm Th}^{4 + } : - 20 \times 10^{- 6}\,\,{\rm emu}\,{\rm mol}^{- 1}.\]

The inset shows the onset of diamagnetic shielding (zfc susceptibility) for a sample of YC 2 (sample 2_a_) (•) and for Y13C2 (sample 1) (•) on an enlarged scale.

  C22 the increment was calculated according to Pascal's method to -6.5x10-6 emu mol-1.33 Samples 2\(b\), 2\(c\), 2\(d\), 5, 6, and 7 (cf. Table 3) were prepared with a slight surplus of carbon which we expect to precipitate in the preparation process as graphite impurities at grain boundaries. The graphite contribution to _kh_Pauili was taken into consideration when evaluating the Pauli susceptibility by using a diamagnetic susceptibility of -90x10-6 emu mol-1 for polycrystalline graphite.34

From _kh_Pauili the electronic density _N_(_E_F)_x_ at the Fermi energy _E_F may be obtained from

\[N(E_{\rm F})_{\chi } = \chi_{\rm Pauli}/2\mu_{\rm B}^{2}.\]

The Pauli susceptibilities fall in a range of 19 to 38 x10-6 emu mol-1 for the different compounds and exhibit a clear dependence on the Th or Ca substitution with the tendency to increase with growing Th content and to decrease when replacing Y by Ca. This observation is in good agreement with the results of the band-structure calculations. Substitution with Th in the oxidation state 4+ raises the number of valence electrons per metal atom to values above 3 per metal atom, while Ca substitution (oxidation state 2+) reduces the valence electron count below 3. The TB-LMTO-ASA band-structure calculations show that the electronic density of states intersects the Fermi level with a positive slope (cf. Fig. 3). In a rigid-band model an increase of the number of valence electrons therefore is expected to raise the Fermi energy and to cause an increase of the electronic density of states and of _kh_Pauili. Figure 7 displays the dependence of the Pauli susceptibility on the valence electron number per metal atom indicating the growth of _kh_Pauili with that number, however with different slopes for the Ca- and Th-substituted samples. Interestingly, \(T_{c}\) is maximized for three valence electrons per metal atom and falls off when reducing or raising the number of valence electrons. The Pauli susceptibilities indicate a density of states at the Fermi level of about 0.5 eV-1 spin-1 f.u-1 which is about 50% larger than the values obtained from the band-structure calculations. This discrepancy indicates some exchange enhancement of the electronic susceptibility which will be discussed in detail below together with the Sommerfeld coefficients extracted from the low-temperature specific-heat measurements and the results of the band-structure calculations.

### Magnetization

The isothermal magnetization was determined on a spherical sample of \({\rm YC}_{2}\) (\(2c\)). In Fig. 8 the negative polarization \(-J(B)\) is plotted for temperatures between 2 and 4 K. The shape of these curves reflect the demagnetization due to the spherical sample geometry as is expected for a type-I superconductor with fully reversible magnetization. However, the polarization curves are irreversible once they deviated from the initial linear low-field increase. This behavior clearly indicates flux penetration in the Shubnikov phase of a type-II superconductor.

The analysis of the polarization curves within the scope of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory yields the characteristic lengths and critical fields. The GL parameter was determined from the slopes of the thermodynamic critical field (\(B_{c\rm th}\)) and the upper critical field (\(B_{c2}\)) near \(T_{c}\) (Fig. 9) according to

\[\kappa = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{\partial B_{c2}/\partial T}{\partial B_{c\rm th}/\partial T}\right)_{T_{c}}\] (4)

and amounts to \(\kappa = 1.07(5)\). This value is close to the type-I-type-II limit of \(1/\sqrt{2}\). The zero-temperature critical fields \(B_{c2}(0) = 59(2)\) mT and \(B_{c\rm th}(0) = 33(2)\) mT were calculated using BCS weak-coupling predictions. An upper limit for \(B_{c1}(T)\) was estimated from the deviation of the \(J(B)\) curves from the initial linear increase.

The coherence length and the penetration depth in the polycrystalline average amount to \(\xi_{\rm GL}^{\rm poly} = 740(50)\) A and \(\lambda_{\rm GL}^{\rm poly} = 810(50)\) A, respectively.

### Specific heat

The specific-heat capacity of \({\rm YC}_{2}\) (sample \(2a\), bulk) is shown in Fig. 10 in a \(c_{p}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) representation. Data sets measured in zero field and in a field of 0.4 T are displayed. The lattice and electronic contribution of the normal-state specific heat \(c_{p,N}\) up to \(\approx\) 9 K are very precisely described by \(c_{p,N}(T) = \gamma_{N}T + \beta T^{3}\) with \(\gamma_{N} = 2.782(5)\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) and \(\beta\) equivalent to an initial Debye temperature \(\Theta_{\rm D}(0)\) of 418(1) K. The fit with the parameters \(\gamma\) and \(\beta\) is given in Fig. 10. The parameters of this and the following fits are listed in Table 4.

Figure 11 displays the difference \(\Delta c_{p}\) between the specific heats of the superconducting and the normal state (\(\Delta c_{p} = c_{p,S} - c_{p,N}\)) for sample \(2a\). The difference \(\Delta c_{p}\) is fully described by the thermodynamic free enthalpy \(\Delta G\) of a superconductor. The electronic specific heat \(\Delta c_{p}(T/T_{c})\) of a weak-coupling BCS-superconductor has been calculated by Muhlschlegel.[35] The jump at the transition \(\Delta c_{p}(T_{c})\) amounts to 1.4261 \(\gamma_{N}T_{c}\).

In the upper panel of Fig. 11 we show a fit of this BCS model of the specific heat to our data of \(\Delta c_{p}\). In order to model the data near the slightly smeared transition a Gaussian distribution of the transition temperatures was included. The parameters of the fit are \(T_{c}\), the width of the transition \(\Delta T_{c}/T_{c}\), and the electronic coefficient \(\gamma_{S}\). We obtain \(T_{c}\) = 3.840(1) K, \(\Delta T_{c}/T_{c}\)= 0.77(3)%, and \(\gamma_{S}\)= 2.790(5) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\). The small transition width indicates good sample homogeneity, especially it indicates that there are only slight variations of the local carbon stoichiometry. A comparison of \(\gamma_{S}\) with \(\gamma_{N}\) shows excellent agreement (difference 0.3%). The plot, however, reveals small systematic differences of the BCS fit. The model predicts too low values in the range 0.82\(-\)0.95 \(T_{c}\) and too high values for \(T\)\(<\)0.82\(T_{c}\).

A model for the thermodynamic properties of a superconductor with BCS-like Cooper pairing and variable electron-phonon coupling strength was suggested by Padamsee _et al.[36]_ In this model (alpha-model) the ratio of the width of

 the gap at the Fermi level at zero temperature \(\alpha\) = \(\Delta(0)/k_{\rm B}T_{c}\) is used to parametrize the specific heat \(\Delta c_{p}\) . In the lower panel of Fig. 11 we display a fit with this model. The free parameters are \(T_{c}\), \(\Delta T_{c}/T_{c}\), \(\gamma_{S}\), and \(\alpha\). We obtain values for \(T_{c}\) and \(\Delta T_{c}/T_{c}\) very similar to those of the BCS model, while the \(\gamma_{S}\) is slightly smaller [2.67(1) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)]. The ratio of \(\gamma_{S}/\gamma_{N}\) deviated now 4% from unity. For the gap parameter we find \(\alpha\) = 1.82(1); a value very close to the weak-coupling BCS limit of \(\alpha_{\rm BCS}\) = 1.764.

The specific heats of a sample in which 20% of the yttrium has been substituted by thorium (Y \({}_{0.8}\)Th\({}_{0.2}\)C\({}_{2}\), sample 6), and of a 10% calcium substituted sample (Y \({}_{0.9}\)Ca\({}_{0.1}\)C\({}_{2}\), sample 8) are shown in Fig. 12 again in a \(\Delta c_{p}(T)\) representation. As described above, both substitutions lower \(T_{c}\) . The effect on the electronic specific heat, however, is different. While the coefficient \(\gamma_{N}\) for the Th-substituted sample is increased by 16% with respect to the value for YC\({}_{2}\), the \(\gamma_{N}\) of the Ca-substituted sample is, within error, the same as in the unsubstituted compound. The parameters for the fits on these two samples are also given in Table 4.

The initial Debye temperatures \(\Theta_{\rm D}(0)\) for the Th- and the Ca-substituted sample are 368 and 427 K, respectively. They are in good accordance with the values calculated from a scaling of \(\Theta_{\rm D}(0)\) = 418 K of YC\({}_{2}\) with the ratio \(\sqrt{M_{\rm YC_{2}}/M_{\rm(Y,Th,Ca)C_{2}}}\) of the molar masses, \(M\), of the individual compounds.

A fit of the \(\alpha\) model to the data of the Th- and Ca-substituted samples (6 and 8) reveals a slightly enhanced parameter \(\alpha\) indicating a tendency to an increased electron-phonon coupling. However, the quality of the \(\Delta c_{p}(T)\) data of these samples is not sufficient to unambiguously distinguish the BCS fit from the \(\alpha\) fit (cf. Table 4). The Sommerfeld coefficients extracted from these fits nicely follow a linear relationship over the valence electron count (cf. Fig. 7) which is similar to the Pauli susceptibilities.

### Electronic properties

In this section we discuss relevant electronic parameters as they can be derived from the results of the specific heat and susceptibility measurements.

Fits of the \(\alpha\) model are given by the lines (details see text).

  The electronic specific heat may be enhanced over its bare value by electron-phonon coupling and by electronic correlations. The enhancement factor \(\lambda_{\rm tot}\) contains the total mass enhancement due to both contributions and is defined by

\[\gamma_{\rm exp} = (1 + \lambda_{\rm tot})\,\gamma_{\rm BS}\]

with \(\gamma_{\rm BS}\) being the 'bare" Sommerfeld coefficient which is related to the calculated electronic density of states \(N(E_{\rm F})_{\rm BS}\) at the Fermi energy via

\[\gamma = \frac{2}{3}\,\pi^{2}k_{\rm B}^{2}N(E_{\rm F})_{\rm BS}\,.\]

Using the McMillan equation an estimate of the electron-phonon coupling parameter \(\lambda_{\rm MM}\) from the measured critical temperatures \(T_{c}\) and the Debye temperatures can be made.[37] With a pseudopotential \(\mu \approx 0.13\) we arrive at electron-phonon coupling parameters of about 0.5 and almost no variation over the three investigated samples. All results are compiled in Table 5 together with the density of states obtained from the TB-LMTO-ASA band-structure calculations and the density of states \(N(E_{\rm F})_{\chi}\) calculated from the Pauli susceptibilities according to Eq. (3).

The enhancement factor \(\lambda_{\rm tot}\) is about 40% larger than the electron-phonon coupling constants estimated from the McMillan equation pointing to some enhancement by electronic correlations. Enhancement by electronic correlations is as well indicated by the Stoner parameter \(U\) which was deduced from the comparison of the experimental Pauli susceptibilities and the bare Pauli susceptibilities calculated from the TB-LMTO density of states according to Eq. (3)

\[\chi_{\rm Pauli}^{\rm exp} = \chi_{\rm Pauli}/(1-U).\]

In contrast to the behavior of \(\lambda_{\rm MM}\), \(\lambda_{\rm tot}\), and \(U\) vary with the number of valence electrons donated by the metal atoms to the C\({}_{2}\) units. \(\lambda_{\rm tot}\) increases with increasing number of valence electrons while \(U\) shows a maximum at YC\({}_{2}\) like the superconducting transition temperature. The origin of this behavior is not clear at present.

Finally, we briefly discuss the variation of \(T_{c}\) induced by substitution of Ca or Th which both lead to a decrease of \(T_{c}\). The reduction of \(T_{c}\) induced by Th substitution clearly contrasts the behavior of yttrium sesquicarbide, Y\({}_{2-x}\)Th\({}_{x}\)C\({}_{3}\) where a maximum \(T_{c}\) of 17 K for a formal charge \(-4.5\) of the C\({}_{2}\) unit is reached for the compound Y\({}_{0.7}\)Th\({}_{0.3}\)C\({}_{1.55}\).[39, 13]

It is particularly interesting to note, that the reduction of \(T_{c}\) is significantly more pronounced in case of Ca than in case of Th substitution (cf. Fig. 7). A clue to understand this difference may come from our findings in the layered Y\({}_{2}\)Br\({}_{2}\)C\({}_{2}\) system.[38] Intercalation of Na _between_ the layers leading to the injection of electrons into the layers is accompanied by an increase of \(T_{c}\). An equivalent addition of electrons due to a substitution of Y by Th _inside_ the layers, however, leads to a decrease of \(T_{c}\). The expected increase of \(T_{c}\) through raising the Fermi level, apparently, is overcompensated by a decrease of \(T_{c}\) through introducing disorder inside the layers in the latter case. The substitution of Y by Th in YC\({}_{2}\) results in a similar decrease of \(T_{c}\) which, however, is less pronounced than in case of Ca substitution where both the decrease of the Fermi level and disorder lower \(T_{c}\). Obviously, substitution of C\({}_{2}\) units by single C atoms (replacement of C\({}_{2}^{\,3-}\) by C\({}^{\,4-}\)) introduces rather similar changes to the system as replacing Y\({}^{\,3+}\) by Ca\({}^{\,2+}\) causing a rather identical response of the system with respect to \(T_{c}\) (cf. Fig. 4).

## V Summary and Conclusions

In summary, the compound YC\({}_{2}\) and its Th/Ca-substituted variants represent a set of interesting superconductors. The results of our extensive experiments unambiguously prove bulk superconductivity in all investigated compounds. The modeling of the thermodynamic properties reveals almost ideal BCS-type behavior in the weak-coupling limit. The carbon isotope effect on the \(T_{c}\) investigated for the compound YC\({}_{2}\) is in best agreement with this conclusion. The analysis of the magnetization curves yields Ginzburg-Landau parameters slightly above the limit of \(1/\sqrt{2}\) (type-II superconductor).

Most intriguing are the results of the Th- and Ca-substitution experiments: While the Sommerfeld coefficients of the electronic specific heat, the Pauli susceptibilities, and the Debye temperatures show a monotonic behavior as function of the electron concentration, \(T_{c}\) exhibits an extremum. The maximum transition temperature in the system (Y,Th/Ca)C\({}_{2}\) is observed close to a valence electron number of 3 per metal atom viz. for the stochiometric compound YC\({}_{2}\). We ascribe the appearance of this maximum to a complex interplay of the degree of electronic filling and disorder due to the substitution of Y with Ca and Th atoms.
