###### Abstract

We have synthesized overdoped metallic samples of Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) beyond the superconductor-metal phase boundary by annealing the samples in high-pressure oxygen. Oxygen incorporation is clearly demonstrated by structural refinements of neutron powder-diffraction data and reversible changes in sample weight. The same \(\sim T^{2}\) scattering mechanism in transport properties as previously observed in superconducting samples is observed in the present overdoped metallic samples. Hall coefficients do not change sign and are still positive for the overdoped metals. Although the crystal structures of both compounds change gradually and continuously with oxygen doping beyond the superconductor-metal phase boundary, the electronic structure of the "further overdoped metals" might still be near the superconductor-metal phase boundary.

## I Introduction

In the phase diagram of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors as a function of carrier doping, superconductivity occurs in an intermediate region between an antiferromagnetic insulator and a metal. This feature suggests that the high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity is connected with a state described as either a spin liquid or a Fermi liquid. Therefore, in order to formulate a mechanism of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductivity, studies of both extremes of behavior are important. However, there are few examples of overdoped materials, so research on overdoped compounds has been somewhat limited.

Heavily Sr or Ba-doped La\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) is the best-known example of an overdoped compound. In the (La\({}_{1-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system, the superconducting transition temperature (\(T_{c}\)) decreases in the overdoped region (\(x>0.075\)) and the superconductivity disappears around \(x=0.15\). The most remarkable feature is that the Hall coefficient changes its sign from positive to negative near \(x=0.15\), the superconductor-metal phase boundary. This suggests a singularity near the superconductor-metal phase boundary and a drastic change in the electronic structure.[1] In the (La\({}_{1-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system, a phase transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry[2]\({}^{-}\)[4] complicates understanding the intrinsic properties in the overdoped region.

Other examples of overdoped compounds are Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) (Refs. [5] and [6]) and TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\)[7], both of which show typical behavior, such as decreasing \(T_{c}\) with increasing hole-carrier concentration, in the overdoped region. In these compounds, oxygen non-stoichiometries in the TIO layers control the carrier concentration. Samples synthesized in 1 atm oxygen show metallic conductivity to below liquid-He temperature and reduction in an argon atmosphere gives rise to superconductivity up to 85 K (Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\)) and 75 K (TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\)). No evidence of inhomogeneity is observed in studies of the superconductivity or crystal structure for the overdoped Tl materials. In contrast to (La\({}_{1-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\), the Hall coefficients and the spin susceptibilities for both compounds show gradual and continuous changes as the behavior changes from superconductors to metals by varying the composition. There seems to be no singularity at the superconductor-metal phase boundary, suggesting that the electronic structures for the superconducting and the metallic states are quite similar.[6, 7]

Although previous studies of transport properties for overdoped Tl compounds suggested a similarity of the electronic structure of the superconducting and metallic states, the continuity at the superconductor-metal phase boundary is still a little vague because the Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) samples annealed in 1 atm oxygen, which show metallic conductivity to below liquid-He temperature, seem to lie very close to the superconductor-metal phase boundary. The release of very small amounts of oxygen from these metallic samples causes superconductivity.[5, 7] Thus, in order to confirm the continuity of the electronic structure, we sought to obtain metallic samples doped further beyond the superconductor-metal phase boundary. Changes in  the crystal structures and the physical properties at crossing the superconductor-metal phase boundary gives important information about the continuity of the electronic structure. It is also important to learn whether the Hall coefficient changes its sign in the overdoped region beyond the boundary.

Recently, a striking feature in the normal state (above \(T_{c}\)) transport properties of high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors has been observed: \(T^{2}\) dependence of the inverse Hall mobility by \(\mu_{H}^{-1}\)=\(\rho\)/\(R_{H}\) (or Hall angle, cot\(\theta_{H}\)=\(\mu_{H}^{-1}\)/\(B\)). This simple relationship is observed in a variety of samples over a broad range of compositions extending from the underdoped through the optimally doped to the overdoped states.[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 6

Data plotted as open symbols are obtained from x-ray-diffraction measurements and the relative changes in oxygen content are determined from weight measurements. Data plotted as closed symbols are obtained from neutron-diffraction measurements and the relative changes in oxygen content are determined from the refined occupation numbers for oxygen atoms. The origin of these relative changes is defined as the value for the samples annealed in 1 atm oxygen. Changes in the occupancy of the excess O(4) site and the lattice parameters determined by structural refinements of neutron-diffraction data for the measured three samples (closed symbols) are also seen in the upper and right axes, respectively. Since absolute values of lattice parameters measured by neutron and x-ray-diffraction do not agree (see text), x-ray results are plotted vs the relative change in lattice parameter. Data plotted as open circles are obtained from Refs. [5] and [17]; open squares are from the present x-ray measurements. Corresponding \(T_{c}\) changes are shown in the lower part of the graph. This scale is an approximation of \(T_{c}\) derived from the almost linear relation between the relative change in oxygen content and \(T_{c}\) in Refs. [5] and [17].

Format is the same as for Fig. 1. Changes in the occupancy of the deficient O(3) site are seen in the upper axes. Data plotted as open circles and the almost linear relation between the relative change in oxygen content and \(T_{c}\) are obtained from Refs. [7].

  site O(3) in the TlO layer are fully occupied. Excess oxygen atoms located at an interstitial site O(4) between the double TlO layers are detected in the oxygenated and high-pressure oxygen-annealed Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) samples. In TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\), the Tl site is fully occupied, but the oxygen site O(3) in the single TlO layer is deficient. About 20% of the Ca site is substituted by Tl. This is consistent with the 15\(-\)20 % Ca deficient and Tl-rich starting composition (typically, Tl:Sr:Ca:Cu = 1.5:2.0:0.8:2.0), which is necessary to obtain a single phase sample. No oxygen is seen in the Ca layer, even for the high-pressure oxygen-annealed TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) samples. All such features in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) agree well with the previous results of neutron-diffraction studies.[18, 21]

Tables 1 and 2 show the results of Rietveld refinements for the Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) samples reduced in argon, annealed in 1 atm oxygen, and annealed in high-pressure oxygen. Changes of the occupancies of the excess oxygen site O(4) in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and the deficient oxygen site O(3) in TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) are clear. We conclude that the incorporation and release of oxygen atoms through the annealing process occurs at these sites. The most notable feature is the increased site occupancies of these sites in the samples annealed in high-pressure oxygen, which clearly demonstrates the oxygen incorporation by the annealing process in high-pressure oxygen. The amounts of incorporated oxygen determined by the changes of the site occupancies in the structural refinements with neutron-diffraction data are about 0.03 atoms per formula unit for the high-pressure oxygen-annealed Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) samples. The increase of oxygen content in the high-pressure oxygen-annealed samples is also measured by the increased sample weight. From these findings, we conclude that these samples are overdoped metals that are further beyond the superconductor-metal phase boundary than previous samples annealed in 1 atm oxygen.

Figures 1 and 2 show the relationships between the lattice parameters and the oxygen contents for Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\), respectively. The previous data for the superconducting samples[7, 17] are shown as open circles. The systematically shorter _c_-axis length (Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\)) and _a_-axis length (TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\)) for the present high-pressure oxygen-annealed samples (open squares) confirm the compositional changes as determined by refinements of site occupancies and weight changes. The results of neutron-diffraction analysis (closed symbols) are also quite consistent with the results of x-ray study. The site occupancies of O(4) in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and O(3) in TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) determined by neutron-diffraction study are also seen in the upper part of the figures. The lattice parameters of the high-pressure oxygen-annealed samples and the superconducting samples show the same linear correlations with oxygen doping, especially, the _c_-axis length in Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+\delta}\) and _a_-axis length in TlSr\({}_{2}\)CaCu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\). Thus, the lattice parameters change continuously and systematically with oxygen doping from high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors to overdoped metals beyond the superconductor-metal phase boundaries with no evidence for a singularity at the boundary.

  samples annealed in 1 atm oxygen and in high-pressure oxygen. There is no significant difference in either the resistivity or the Hall coefficient for the two samples. The temperature dependence of the resistivity for the two samples can be fitted to a simple power expansion of \(\rho = \rho_{0} + {\it{AT}}^{1.7}\) for the temperature range from 5 to 300 K. The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient shows a characteristic maximum at around 120 K, which is the same feature observed in the superconducting samples [6, 15]. Figure 4 shows the inverse Hall mobility \(\mu_{H}^{- 1} = \rho/R_{H}\) plotted against \(T^{2}\). Clear correlations of \(\mu_{H}^{- 1} \propto T^{2}\) are observed for both the samples annealed in 1 atm oxygen and in high-pressure oxygen. This \(T^{2}\) dependence of the inverse Hall mobility is exactly the same as that observed in superconducting Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6 + b}\) samples [14, 15]. This fact strongly suggests that the scattering mechanism that controls the transport properties in the present overdoped samples, which are beyond the superconductor-metal phase boundary, is the same as that for the superconducting materials. In other words, the electronic structures of both the superconducting and the overdoped metallic samples are essentially the same and a single \(\sim T^{2}\) scattering mechanism governs the transport properties over the whole region.

It is worth noting that the Hall coefficient for the overdoped metallic sample remains positive. Figure 5 shows the change of the Hall coefficient of Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6 + b}\) as a function of oxygen content, i.e., doping level. The Hall coefficient decreases gradually with doping and almost saturates in the overdoped metallic region. There is no singularity at the superconductor-metal phase boundary. This result is in sharp contrast with that for the (La\({}_{1-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system, where the Hall coefficient changes its sign near the boundary. Thus, the coincidence of the superconductor-metal phase boundary with the point of sign change in the Hall coefficient in the (La\({}_{1-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) system may be accidental.

The saturation of the Hall coefficient in the overdoped metallic region deserves comment. In the overdoped region, as pointed out in the studies of (La\({}_{1-x}\)Sr\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{4}\) (Ref. 1) and Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6 + b}\)[6], the doping level based on the chemical composition does not correspond with the number of carriers determined from the Hall coefficient measurements. Since the Hall coefficient reflects the number of carriers that contributes to the transport properties, this observation might indicate that the hole concentration in the CuO\({}_{2}\) plane does not change significantly in the metallic region as "doping" is increased further. The hole carriers created by the additional oxygen incorporation may not be transferred to the CuO\({}_{2}\) planes but, rather, may be localized in the TIO charge reservoir layers. This means that the electronic structure of the high-pressure oxygen-annealed sample, which is clearly "further overdoped by oxygen" beyond the superconductor-metal phase boundary might still be

  near the superconductor-metal phase boundary.

Similar results are obtained for the \(\rm TlSr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{7-8}\) system. There is no significant change in the temperature dependence of the resistivity for the samples annealed in 1 atm oxygen and in high-pressure oxygen as shown in Fig. 6. The temperature dependencies for the two samples are almost \(T^{1.7}\) for the temperature range from 5 to 300 K suggesting no drastic change in the electronic structure at the superconductor-metal phase boundary.

In conclusion, the present experimental results on overdoped Tl\({}_{2}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{6+8}\) and \(\rm TlSr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{7-8}\) compounds show no singularity at the superconductor-metal phase boundary in either the crystal structure or the transport properties. In particular, the positive Hall coefficient and the \(T^{2}\) dependence of the inverse Hall mobility in the overdoped Tl-based materials strongly suggest that the electronic structures are essentially the same as those of the corresponding superconducting materials. However, in contrast to the clear continuity of the crystal structural changes at crossing the superconductor-metal phase boundary, the "oxygen doping" beyond the boundary does not create additional itinerant hole carriers in the materials.

If we consider the \(T^{2}\) dependence of the inverse Hall mobility and nearly \(T^{2}\) dependence of the resistivity to be characteristic features of a two-dimensional Fermi liquid,[14] these results suggest that the electronic structure of the high-\(T_{c}\) superconductors should be described within this framework.
