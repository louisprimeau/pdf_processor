###### Abstract

A neutron-diffraction study of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} structure and its dependence on extra oxygen content for \delta between 0.06 and 0.19 has been carried out with four pure samples using high-resolution TOF and \lambda = const diffractometers at room temperature and T = 8 K. Sample characterization was done by measuring ac susceptibility, x-ray and EPR spectra, and by iodometric titration. A detailed analysis of atomic structure and the occupancy factors of mercury and oxygen was performed and showed the stoichiometric cation content. Extra oxygen was found only in the (1/2,1/2,0) position of the basal plane. T_{c} varied parabolically with \delta and exhibited a maximum of 98 K at \delta = 0.12. The data obtained can be considered as evidence of the conventional anion doping mechanism with 2\delta holes per CuO_{2} layer. [S0163-1829(97)01506-3]

## I Introduction

One of the obstacles encountered in investigation of the mechanisms of high-T_{c} superconductivity is connected with fair complexity of the crystal structure of copper oxides and diversity of their structural defects. This is the reason why mercury-bearing superconducting copper mixed oxides with general formulas of HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} are attractive to the investigation of the relationship between structure and superconducting properties. These compounds have a remarkably high critical temperature and relatively simple crystal structures. The simplicity of their structures is caused by the absence of a mismatch between the layers of (CuO_{2}), (BaO), (Ca), and (HgO_{\delta}) alternating along the c axis of the unit cell.[1] Moreover, the first member of the homologous series HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (designated Hg-1201) has practically none of the layer stacking faults along the c axis existing in other members of the series2 that introduce systematic errors into the refinement of these layered structures based on diffraction data. As a result, Hg-1201 can be considered as one of the most convenient compounds for the structural studies of high-T_{c} materials.

The simplicity of the HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} structure created great interest in investigating the structure of this compound with different extra oxygen contents (\delta), which influence the transition temperature to the superconducting state (T_{c}).[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] It should be mentioned that the presence of only one type of oxidizing fragment in the HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} structure, namely, Cu atoms in (CuO_{2}) layers, provides a paraboliclike dependence of T_{c} on the extra oxygen content, which determines the hole concentration in the conducting band (p). Assuming the formal valence of the atoms to be V_{Hg}=V_{Ba} = + 2 and V_{O} = -2, one can calculate the hole concentration p = 2 \delta for Hg-1201. The results of iodometrical titration, to determine the formal copper valence (V_{Cu}),[8, 10, 12] showed that the maximum transition temperature is realized at V_{Cu} = + 2.16 and T_{c} drops when the oxygen content shifts to either sides of this optimal value. This result is in a good agreement with experimental data obtained for other Cu-containing superconductors.[13, 14, 15] Based on this data, the universal parabola equation for the dependence of T_{c} on p was proposed.[14]

\[T_{c}/T_{c,\max} = 1 - 82.6\ \ (p - 0.16)^{2}.\] (1)

According to this equation, the maximum transition temperature is realized at a hole concentration corresponding to the formal copper valence of V_{Cu} = + 2.16.

Recently, several structural investigations of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} based on powder neutron-diffraction experiments, were done.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] In general, there is good agreement between the refined structural parameters, but, at the same time, there are severe discrepancies concerning the Hg and interstitial oxygen positions and occupancies. As an example, the occupancies of the O3 position (the center of the Hg layer) obtained in Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] for samples with close T_{c} are listed in Table 1. Calculations of the formal copper valence based on some of these data lead to numbers considerably different from the optimal value determined by Eq. (1).

In the first structural paper on Hg-1201, the extra oxygen was put in the center of the basal plane only,[3] but later in

\end{table}
Table 1: Oxygen content in the O3 position (the center of Hg layer) in Hg-1201 structure with T_{c} close to T_{c,\max} as was obtained in neutron-diffraction experiments.

  Refs. 5 and 7 were found partial substitution of Hg atoms by copper (7 and 20 %) and the appearance of additional interstitial oxygen near the perovskite oxygen position (middle of the edge) bonded to these Cu atoms. That this substitution takes place, though probably under specific synthetic conditions, and complicates the interpretation of the T_{c} vs p relationship because of the additional Cu atom (in the Hg position) which can change the oxidation state.

For the fitting between neutron and thermoelectric power data of Hg-1201 samples with different d values, a formal charge close to -1 for the interstitial oxygen atom was suggested.6,11 This oxidation state, however, was only found earlier in the peroxide group.16 The existence of isolated O-1 ions in the Hg-1201 structure at such long distances from the cations (_d_Hg-O3 and _d_Ba-O32>2.7 A) is doubtful because of the high chemical activity of the O-1 ions due to the unpaired electron.

Mercury cations can be partially replaced not only by copper but also by carbonate groups, as was shown for the Hg-1201 and Hg-1223 samples obtained by the high-pressure technique.8,17 It should be mentioned that in this case isovalent substitution is realized because [HgO2]2- dumbbells are replaced by [CO3]2- groups that do not change the hole concentration. But the presence of the additional oxygen atoms bonded to carbon can lead to the higher oxygen concentration found from neutron data. Thus, in studying Hg oxides, we are faced with a typical high-_T__c_ materials problem when it is not quite clear what is under investigation, compound or sample.

In this paper, using our previous experience, we have tried to synthesize a series of monophase Hg-1201 samples with different d for systematic investigation of the occupation of the interstitial oxygen position (or positions) as well as the problem of partial occupation of Hg position or deficiency of this position. A sample characterization was done by measuring ac susceptibility, x-ray spectra, ICP-AES element analysis for Hg, Ba, and Cu, and by iodometric titration. Important information was obtained by measuring EPR spectra. The main part of the experiments was carried out with the high-resolution diffractometers at the IBR-2 high-flux pulsed neutron source in Dubna and at the steady-state reactor Orphee in Saclay. Due to the high-quality diffraction data we were able to obtain the precise structural information from the Rietveld refinement and additionally to calculate scattering density maps to reveal the important details of the structure.

## II Synthesis and sample characterization

Four samples of HgBa2CuO4+_d_ (_A_, B, C, and _D_) were synthesized from stoichiometric mixtures of Ba2CuO3+_x_ and HgO according to methods described in Ref. 12. The synthesis was carried out at 800 degC for 6 h in evacuated silica tubes in a two-temperature gradient furnace. Samples A, C, and D were annealed at controlled partial oxygen pressures, created by a mixture of Co3O4/CoO and CuO/Cu2O oxides (for sample _D_) situated in the hotter part of the tubes. Samples A (_m_ = 2.09 g) and C (_m_ = 1.93 g) were obtained at _p_(O2) = 0.15 bar; sample D (_m_ = 1.84 g) was obtained at _p_(O2) = 0.0012 bar. In the case of sample B (_m_ = 2.05 g), an additional pellet of Ba2CuO3+_x_ was placed in the hot part of the tube (820 degC) to decrease the partial mercury pressure. Samples thus synthesized were then annealed for more than 24 h in a flow of oxygen at 250 degC (_C_ and _D_), argon at 350 degC (_A_), and under oxygen pressure as high as 90 bars at 250 degC (_B_).

Phase composition of the samples was determined from x-ray powder data (Guinier FR-552 focusing camera, Cu_Ka_1 radiation, l = 1.540 56 A, Ge internal standard). Samples A, B, C contained only the Hg-1201 phase, with the exception of traces of the starting Ba2CuO3+_x_ phase found with the main Hg-1201 phase in sample D.

To check chemical composition of one of the monophase samples obtained at the same conditions and with cell parameters close to sample C, its full chemical analysis was carried out in MPI (Stuttgart). Hg, Ba, and Cu concentrations were determined by the ICP-AES technique, and total oxygen content by the "solid-state hot-gas" method (crystal SiO2 as an internal standard). It gave good agreement with a stoichiometric cation composition: Hg0.99(1)Ba2.00(1)Cu0.99(1)O4.03(6).

The formal oxidation state of copper was determined by iodometric titration, described in Ref. 18. Based on the iodometric data, the formal charges of copper atoms were _V_Cu=+2.02 (sample _A_), +2.25 (_B_), +2.16 (_C_) with statistical errors of 0.02. The formal oxidation states of the other atoms was assumed to be standard: _V_Hg=_V_Ba=+2 and _V_O=-2. In this case, the chemical formulas of the studied compounds can be written as HgBa2CuO4.01(1) (_A_), HgBa2CuO4.1(1) (_B_), HgBa2CuO4.08(1) (_C_). Sample D was not investigated by this method due to the presence of impurities which were detected by x rays. The oxygen content of all samples including sample D was refined then in a neutron-diffraction experiment.

  transitions for samples A and B is not sharp, probably due to an inhomogeneous distribution of the extra oxygen, the temperature of the sharp drop in _kh_ was assumed as the transition temperature, namely, T_{c} = 71 K (_A_), 83 K (_B_), 98 K (_C_) and 96 K (_D_).

Measurements of EPR spectra for samples A and C were performed on the 3-cm range E-4 (Varian) EPR spectrometer. Powder patterns with ~1-_m_m particle sizes were used for the measurements. This allowed the skin effect on the EPR spectra to be excluded, because of the thickness of the skin layer at the working frequency of the spectrometer (9.18 GHz), for a sample with a resistivity of several mOhm cm is about 10-20 _m_m. EPR spectra were measured at room temperature in a range of magnetic fields up to 4000 Gs, at microwave frequency power of 20 mW, with modulation amplitude of magnetic field of 8 Gs and frequency modulation of 100 kHz.

## III Neutron Diffraction

Neutron-diffraction experiments were performed with the high-resolution Fourier diffractometer[19] (HRFD) at the IBR-2 pulsed reactor in Dubna and with the constant wavelength diffractometer 3T2 at the Orphee reactor in Saclay. The HRFD diffractometer is a time-of-flight (TOF) correlation spectrometer using a fast-Fourier chopper for modulating the intensity of the incident neutron beam and the RTOF method for gathering scattered neutrons. The HRFD _d_-spacing resolution depends on the frequency of the intensity modulation, and in the experiments with HgBa2CuO4+_d_ it was close to D_d_/_d_ = 0.0015. The 3T2 (_l_ = 1.227 A) is a high-resolution powder diffractometer (D_d_/_d_ is close to 0.003 at the minimum of the resolution curve for 10' collimator before sample), equipped with 20 ^{3}He detectors.

A cylindrical, 5-mm-diam, Ti-Zr sample holder without coherent scattering was used to hold the Hg-1201 powder. Diffraction patterns were measured with HRFD for samples A -_D_ at room temperature and for sample B at T = 8 K. The 3T2 was used for measuring the diffraction pattern of sample A at T = 293 and 8 K.

For samples A, B, and C, all diffraction lines corresponded to the well-known Hg-1201 structure with the tetragonal P4/_mmm_ space group. No attributes of extraneous phases were obtained, confirming the high quality of these samples. For sample D, weak peaks (intensities were less than 1% of the strongest peak) of the Ba2CuO3+_x_ phase were found in the spectrum.

Data processing was performed by the Rietveld method using the m stria (Ref. 20) and fullprof (Ref. 21) programs for diffraction patterns from HRFD and 3T2, correspondingly. For the coherent scattering length, we used[22] 12.69, 5.07, 7.718, and 5.803 fm (1 fm = 10-13 cm) for Hg, Ba, Cu, and O, respectively. The absorption correction was calculated using the tabulated absorption and incoherent scattering cross sections. For the HRFD spectra the influence of absorption was noticeable for d >= 1.8 A (_l_ >=3.5 A). The lattice parameter calibration was done using the Al2O3 NIST standard SRM-676. Rietveld structural analysis of the HRFD spectra was performed on the d_{l} interval from 0.81 to 2.09 A, with 110 diffraction peaks of Hg-1201, using the starting parameters as given in Ref. 3. Figure 2 shows an example of these refinements (_d_ >=0.12, sample _C_). The diffraction patterns measured on the 3T2 diffractometer were refined for the interval of 6deg<= d >=126deg with ~150 peaks. The refinements were performed for the z coordinates of Ba and O2 (oxygen in the apical position), the occupancy factors of Hg and O3 (oxygen in the center of the Hg plane), and for the thermal factors of all atoms except the O3 atom. In the final refinement, the thermal factor of copper was kept fixed [_B_(Cu)=0.5] to reduce the influence of systematic errors on the occupancy factor analysis.

## IV Results and Discussion

### Structure data for Hg-1201

The initial refinement was carried out assuming full occupancy of the mercury positions. The results are presented in Table 2, together with the relevant bond distances. The good correspondence between the data for sample A, which were obtained on two diffractometers and by using different refinement programs, can be noted.

On the whole, the listed results are in good agreement with the Hg-1201 structure data published in Refs. 4-9, and especially with the data of a recent neutron-diffraction study.[6] All of the known features of the Hg-1201 structure and, specifically, the dependence on temperature and oxygen content mentioned in Refs. 4-6, are confirmed.

The decrease in the a and c lattice parameters was 0.008 (0.009) and 0.025 (0.027) A, respectively, for sample A (_B_) as the temperature decreased to 8 K. The shortening of the c axis in sample A is mainly the result of the shortening of the Cu-O2 bond distance, while both Cu-O2 and Hg-O2 distances decrease in the same degree in sample B.

For the samples with various extra oxygen contents, there is a correlation between d and the value of the lattice parameters and some interatomic bonds. The Cu-O1 in-plane distance and the Cu-O2 apical distance decrease if d increases, while the Hg-O2 distance increases (Fig. 3). The significant dependence of the Cu-O2 and Ba-O3 apical bonds on extra oxygen should be stressed. The overall contraction of the c

  lattice parameter is only 0.008 A over a range of d from d  0.06 (sample _A_) to d = 0.19 (sample _B_), while both the Cu-O2 and Ba-O3 distances decrease by ~0.03 A. As a result the interlayer distance between the Ba and O2 layers decreases greatly (by ~0.06 A). Qualitatively, this can be interpreted on the basis of the Coulomb splitting model, suggested in Ref. [23], as a positive charge transfer to the CuO2 layer when the oxygen content increases in the HgO_d_ layer.

### Occupation of mercury positions

As shown in Table 2, the temperature factors of Hg and O2, which form a dumbbell configuration of Hg-O2 are quite large. The same unexpectedly large values of these parameters were found in Refs. [4]-[8]. Thermal motion gives an essential contribution to the thermal factors, because at T = 8 K, the value _B_(Hg), for instance, becomes several times smaller in comparison with room temperature, though it stays large. This last effect can indicate some structural disorder or partial occupation of the site. The attempt at structure refinement with disordered Hg sites gave no effect, which means that there is no static displacement. In a joint refinement of Hg occupancy and thermal parameter the coordinates of other atoms do not change but _n_(Hg) and _B_(Hg) are markedly reduced (these new values are also listed in Table 2). These two parameters, _n_(Hg) and _B_(Hg), correlate strongly that do not lead to a conclusion about their real values. In Fig. 4, the dependence of _n_(Hg) on _B_(Hg) is shown, which was obtained in a refinement at fixed values of _B_(Hg) for sample C. The same figure shows the R_{w} factor as a function of _B_(Hg), with a gently sloping minimum at _B_(Hg) = 1.0-1.8 A2 and, accordingly, at _n_(Hg) = 0.9-1.0.

A possible explanation for such a low occupancy factor or the large thermal factor of Hg can be mercury substitution for copper or a carbonate group, as it was suggested in Refs. [5], [7], and [8]. If the condition _n_(Hg) + _n_(Cu/C) = 1 is fulfilled, the refined occupancy factors would be _n_(Hg)  0.9 and _n_(Cu/C)  0.1. The authors of Refs. [5] and [7] have proved the Hg substitution for Cu by the additional extra oxygen atoms located near the middle of the edge of the Hg mesh with an appropriate square coordination for the Cu cations. We tried to find this additional oxygen by calculating the experimental scattering density distribution and drawing maps for the various cross sections of the unit cell. The very high d_{l} reso

The sensitivity of the search can be estimated from Fig. 5, where the difference map of the scattering density for the basal plane of sample A with \delta\approx0.06 is shown. The scattering density maximum of the O3 atom can be clearly seen. The amplitude of its peak is \sim2.5 times larger than the most intensive background maxima. This means that atoms with coherent scattering lengths close to that of oxygen (for instance, carbon) would be found if occupation of their positions in the structure is close or higher than 3%. The (1/2,y,z) cross section of the Fourier map for sample C is shown in Fig. 6. One can see that in the positions 1/2,0,z (z\approx 0.04) and 1/2,y,0 (y\approx 0.08), where additional oxygen was found in Refs. 5 and 7, no real peaks are present. It should be noted that we did not see any static disorder of the O3 atom along the diagonal that was found in Ref. 7.

Thus, the additional O4 atom and, consequently, the noticeable substitution of Hg for Cu were not present in our samples and we can now conclude that the large value of _B_(Hg) and _B_(O2) are the consequence of large oscillations of the HgO_{2} fragment as a whole. It should be mentioned once more that the chemical analysis performed with one of our samples showed a practically stoichiometric cation composition and, consequently, confirmed an absence of noticeable cation replacement. The same conclusion was made in Ref. 6 on the basis of structural data, and in Ref. 24 where the studies of Hg_{1-x}Cu_{x}Ba_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} samples obtained under high pressure of 1.8 GPa were carried out. This agrees also

The amplitude of the O3 maximum is equivalent to the coherent scattering length of 0.35 fm, the background peak amplitudes are not higher than 0.14 fm.

  with the right temperature dependence of _B_(Hg) and _B_(O2) although the x-ray-absorption fine-structure (XAFS) data [25] did not show large amplitudes of Hg-O bond movement, due to its high covalence.

The other additional effect that can raise the value of _B_(Hg) is the deficiency of Hg positions at the surface of the Hg-1201 grains, which was found in Ref. 26 for quenched samples. To some degree, this is proved by comparing the results obtained for samples C and D, which were synthesized at different oxygen partial pressures (0.15 and 0.0012 bar) and then annealed under the same conditions. The different oxygen partial pressures in a closed volume during the synthesis of Hg-1201 lead to the different mercury partial pressures, which was higher for sample D. This means that this sample should be more Hg deficient than sample C. Indeed, the c axes of these two samples are different, while the a parameters are the same. It is interesting to note that sample D has a lower T_{c} value that can also be a consequence of the cation stoichiometry violation.

### Extra oxygen position occupation and its influence on T_{c}

Special attention was made to the extra oxygen O3 occupancy refinement. The small amount of extra oxygen in the structure does not allow its thermal parameter to be determined accurately. The problem is alleviated by the small correlation between O3 occupancy and thermal parameter. The variation of _B_(O3) over a large range [parameter refinement with different fixed _B_(O3) values] did not change d more than one standard deviation (Fig. 7). The much stronger correlation shown in Fig. 4 was found between _n_(Hg) and _B_(Hg), but changing these values did not vary the d value. Refinements done with and without the absorption correction caused an alteration of less than 0.01 for the d value.

The _n_(O3) parameters are listed in Table 2, they were obtained with fixed _B_(O3)=1 A2. These occupancy parameters are significantly smaller than those determined by Huang _et al._[6] for the HgBa2CuO4+_d_ superconductors with close _T__c_'s (curves 2 and 3 in Fig. 8). A shift in the two T_{c}(_d_) dependencies from each other with d  0.05 can be easily seen. The T_{c}(_d_) dependence for our samples where the d content was determined by iodometric titration, assuming _V_Ba=_V_Hg + + 2, _V_O = - 2 is shown also in Fig. 8. The additional experimental data obtained by this analysis for other Hg-1201 samples synthesized under similar conditions are depicted in Fig. 8 by the same sign (+).

The paraboliclike dependencies are shifted from each other along the d axis. The maximum discrepancy in the d values for the samples with close _T__c_'s exists between the iodometric data and the neutron-diffraction data from Ref. 6. The estimated hole concentration for the Hg-1201 sample with maximum T_{c}, based on thermoelectric power data was found to be +2.16 (Ref. 11) and it fits well with our iodometric data. However, the thermoelectric power technique allows only the hole concentration in the (CuO2) layers to be estimated, while the iodometric titration determines the overall hole concentration and does not distinguish the holes between the different structural fragments: the (CuO2) layers or the Hg or O atoms, etc. The discrepancies between the neutron-diffraction and thermoelectric power data were explained in Refs. 6 and 11 as that, for every extra oxygen inserted, one hole in the (CuO2) layers is created while its formal charge becomes -1. Self-consistent local-density-approximation calculations performed for the Hg-1223 structure revealed strong covalence between Hg and interstitial oxygen, [27] which decreases significantly the doping level of the (CuO2) layers in comparison with that expected from formal ionic consideration. However, chemical analysis, which determines the overall hole concentration, in the case of the optimally doped Hg-1201 phase, must reveal the hole concentration p = 0.32. Our experimental data for the samples with maximum _T__c_'s were much lower (_p_ = 0.16 or

  V_{\rm Cu}\!=\!+2.16), and this fact creates some doubts about the assumption of the O3 formal charge being equal to -1.

The presence of the O^{-} anion in the Hg-1201 structure, located far from the cations, (d_{\rm Hg\!\!-\!O3}=2.75 A and d_{\rm Ba\!\!-\!O3}=2.84 A) should provide a response in the EPR spectra due to the unpaired electron. The EPR spectra (first derivative of the absorption signal) normalized by the amplifier coefficient K_{\rm ampl} and the mole number N_{\rm mole} of the reduced sample A and sample C treated in an oxygen flow are shown in Fig. 9. In the same figure, the 1000-times-reduced EPR spectrum of Y_{2}BaCuO_{5} is shown. This structure has an unpaired electron in the Cu^{2+} cation and was used as a standard. All spectra exhibit large g-factor anisotropy: g_{\perp}\!=\!2.04\!\pm\!0.02 and g_{\parallel}\!=\!2.23\!\pm\!0.02, which is typical for powdered samples of compounds with Cu^{2+} cations in their structure in an axial-symmetric coordination.

Due to the low intensity of the EPR signals of the Hg-1201 samples, and practically the same line shape and width for all three of the samples studied, an estimation of the paramagnetic centre concentration was made using A_{\rm norm}\!=\!A/(K_{\rm ampl}\!\times\!N_{\rm mole}) and was compared with A_{\rm norm} for Y_{2}BaCuO_{5}. The values thus obtained (number of unpaired electrons per formula unit) are 3.5\times10^{-4} for sample C and 1.4\times10^{-4} for sample A. Such a small number of paramagnetic centers (more than 400 times smaller than the extra oxygen concentration) and a shape specific to the Cu^{2+} cations, the width of the signals and the values of the g factors, allow us to conclude that the EPR signals from the O^{-} anions are absent. However, this phenomenon can be attributed to the covalent interaction between Hg and extra oxygen, as it was revealed in Ref. [27]. The origin of the weak EPR signals can be due to local defects in the Hg-1201 structure or to small amounts of impurity phases (not found by XRD analysis) containing Cu^{2+} cations.

Additional confirmation of the absence of O^{-} anions in the Hg-1201 structure is the much lower \delta value obtained in Refs. [4] and [9] and in the present work in comparison with the data from Ref. [6]. It should be noted that for the second member of the series, HgBa_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{6+\vartheta},[9, 28, 29] whose structure has one type of Cu cation in a pyramidal coordination, the optimal \delta value as calculated for one (CuO_{2}) layer is also smaller and equals \delta2=0.11 for all of the compounds studied.

## V Conclusions

The realized study of monophase HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} samples with different \delta and T_{c} at the neutron high-resolution diffractometers allowed new precise structural information to be obtained, including thermal atomic parameters and extra oxygen concentration.

Scattering density maps were calculated to find the possible appearance of additional atoms in the Hg layer, with the exception of the O3 atom located in the middle of the mesh. We conclude that no significant replacement of Hg cations by others takes place and no additional extra oxygen atoms near the middle of the edge were found in our particular samples of the Hg-1201 phase. The large value of the temperature factors of Hg and O2, which form a dumbbell configuration of Hg-O_{2}, are the consequence of large oscillations of this fragment as a whole.

The determined T_{c}(\delta) dependence exhibits a parabolic-like behavior similar to that found in previous works,[6, 8, 10, 11] and it agrees with the iodometric analysis data. However, these curves are shifted apart along the \delta axis, an especially large shift is between the neutron-diffraction data from Ref. [6] and the iodometric data. The probable reason can be that despite the high accuracy of the neutron data [standard deviation of the n(O3) is about 0.01], the real error can be significantly larger and cause a systematic shift from the real n(O3) value. First of all, the large discrepancies in extra oxygen content can be due to distinct cation composition of Hg-1201 phases studied by different groups. In this case the T_{c} values are determined not only by oxygen content, but by a range of cations replacement also.

From our analysis, including the analysis of correlation between occupancy and thermal factor of the O3 atom, we believe that systematic error for oxygen content in our samples does not exceed 0.02. A small additional reason of \delta shifting towards to a higher value can be extra oxygen inhomogeneity in the sample, leads to the polyphase state of a sample. Such phenomenon of macroscopic phase separation, due to low-temperature extra oxygen diffusion, was studied already in detail both for powdered samples[30] and single crystals[31] of La_{2}CuO_{4+\vartheta} The presence of incoherent scattering domains with different amounts of the extra oxygen in the crystallites of the sample can lead to a higher value of \delta if the refinement was done using the single phase model. But, such effects cannot be strong. The 15% broadening of the reflections in the studied Hg-1201 samples, in comparison with the experimental resolution function of the diffractometer, supports the anion inhomogeneity hypothesis. In turn, the iodometric data may be shifted to smaller \delta due to the possible presence of amorphous impurity phases in the sample.

Taken into account these factors, we can conclude that the optimal \delta values for the Hg-1201 superconductor are in the range \delta=0.08-0.12. The large discrepancy of our data with the \delta values determined in Ref. [6] (where \delta=0.18 was found) is not clear. The hypothesis of the O3 formal charge being equal to -1 causes some doubts and cannot explain this discrepancy. We think that the probable reason for overestimation of the O3 content can be due to the phenomena discussed above or due to an insertion of the additional "non-oxidizing" oxygen atoms into the structure, located in the

  {\rm CO}_{3}^{2-} groups, as was suggested in Ref. 8, or in the OH (H_{2}O) groups.

Additional neutron-diffraction experiments of monophase Hg-based superconductors, especially with large amounts of extra oxygen, e.g., HgBa_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, will allow important information to be obtained concerning the mechanism of hole creation in this superconducting series. The data obtained in the present work (neutron-diffraction, iodometry, EPR) support the traditional mechanism of hole creation in the conducting band, with a concentration close to 2\delta.

###### Abstract

A neutron-diffraction study of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} structure and its dependence on extra oxygen content for \delta between 0.06 and 0.19 has been carried out with four pure samples using high-resolution TOF and \lambda = const diffractometers at room temperature and T = 8 K. Sample characterization was done by measuring ac susceptibility, x-ray and EPR spectra, and by iodometric titration. A detailed analysis of atomic structure and the occupancy factors of mercury and oxygen was performed and showed the stoichiometric cation content. Extra oxygen was found only in the (1/2,1/2,0) position of the basal plane. T_{c} varied parabolically with \delta and exhibited a maximum of 98 K at \delta = 0.12. The data obtained can be considered as evidence of the conventional anion doping mechanism with 2\delta holes per CuO_{2} layer. [S0163-1829(97)01506-3]

## I Introduction

One of the obstacles encountered in investigation of the mechanisms of high-T_{c} superconductivity is connected with fair complexity of the crystal structure of copper oxides and diversity of their structural defects. This is the reason why mercury-bearing superconducting copper mixed oxides with general formulas of HgBa_{2}Ca_{n-1}Cu_{n}O_{2n+2+\delta} are attractive to the investigation of the relationship between structure and superconducting properties. These compounds have a remarkably high critical temperature and relatively simple crystal structures. The simplicity of their structures is caused by the absence of a mismatch between the layers of (CuO_{2}), (BaO), (Ca), and (HgO_{\delta}) alternating along the c axis of the unit cell.[1] Moreover, the first member of the homologous series HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} (designated Hg-1201) has practically none of the layer stacking faults along the c axis existing in other members of the series2 that introduce systematic errors into the refinement of these layered structures based on diffraction data. As a result, Hg-1201 can be considered as one of the most convenient compounds for the structural studies of high-T_{c} materials.

The simplicity of the HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} structure created great interest in investigating the structure of this compound with different extra oxygen contents (\delta), which influence the transition temperature to the superconducting state (T_{c}).[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] It should be mentioned that the presence of only one type of oxidizing fragment in the HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} structure, namely, Cu atoms in (CuO_{2}) layers, provides a paraboliclike dependence of T_{c} on the extra oxygen content, which determines the hole concentration in the conducting band (p). Assuming the formal valence of the atoms to be V_{Hg}=V_{Ba} = + 2 and V_{O} = -2, one can calculate the hole concentration p = 2 \delta for Hg-1201. The results of iodometrical titration, to determine the formal copper valence (V_{Cu}),[8, 10, 12] showed that the maximum transition temperature is realized at V_{Cu} = + 2.16 and T_{c} drops when the oxygen content shifts to either sides of this optimal value. This result is in a good agreement with experimental data obtained for other Cu-containing superconductors.[13, 14, 15] Based on this data, the universal parabola equation for the dependence of T_{c} on p was proposed.[14]

\[T_{c}/T_{c,\max} = 1 - 82.6\ \ (p - 0.16)^{2}.\] (1)

According to this equation, the maximum transition temperature is realized at a hole concentration corresponding to the formal copper valence of V_{Cu} = + 2.16.

Recently, several structural investigations of HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} based on powder neutron-diffraction experiments, were done.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] In general, there is good agreement between the refined structural parameters, but, at the same time, there are severe discrepancies concerning the Hg and interstitial oxygen positions and occupancies. As an example, the occupancies of the O3 position (the center of the Hg layer) obtained in Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] for samples with close T_{c} are listed in Table 1. Calculations of the formal copper valence based on some of these data lead to numbers considerably different from the optimal value determined by Eq. (1).

In the first structural paper on Hg-1201, the extra oxygen was put in the center of the basal plane only,[3] but later in

\end{table}
Table 1: Oxygen content in the O3 position (the center of Hg layer) in Hg-1201 structure with T_{c} close to T_{c,\max} as was obtained in neutron-diffraction experiments.

  Refs. 5 and 7 were found partial substitution of Hg atoms by copper (7 and 20 %) and the appearance of additional interstitial oxygen near the perovskite oxygen position (middle of the edge) bonded to these Cu atoms. That this substitution takes place, though probably under specific synthetic conditions, and complicates the interpretation of the T_{c} vs p relationship because of the additional Cu atom (in the Hg position) which can change the oxidation state.

For the fitting between neutron and thermoelectric power data of Hg-1201 samples with different d values, a formal charge close to -1 for the interstitial oxygen atom was suggested.6,11 This oxidation state, however, was only found earlier in the peroxide group.16 The existence of isolated O-1 ions in the Hg-1201 structure at such long distances from the cations (_d_Hg-O3 and _d_Ba-O32>2.7 A) is doubtful because of the high chemical activity of the O-1 ions due to the unpaired electron.

Mercury cations can be partially replaced not only by copper but also by carbonate groups, as was shown for the Hg-1201 and Hg-1223 samples obtained by the high-pressure technique.8,17 It should be mentioned that in this case isovalent substitution is realized because [HgO2]2- dumbbells are replaced by [CO3]2- groups that do not change the hole concentration. But the presence of the additional oxygen atoms bonded to carbon can lead to the higher oxygen concentration found from neutron data. Thus, in studying Hg oxides, we are faced with a typical high-_T__c_ materials problem when it is not quite clear what is under investigation, compound or sample.

In this paper, using our previous experience, we have tried to synthesize a series of monophase Hg-1201 samples with different d for systematic investigation of the occupation of the interstitial oxygen position (or positions) as well as the problem of partial occupation of Hg position or deficiency of this position. A sample characterization was done by measuring ac susceptibility, x-ray spectra, ICP-AES element analysis for Hg, Ba, and Cu, and by iodometric titration. Important information was obtained by measuring EPR spectra. The main part of the experiments was carried out with the high-resolution diffractometers at the IBR-2 high-flux pulsed neutron source in Dubna and at the steady-state reactor Orphee in Saclay. Due to the high-quality diffraction data we were able to obtain the precise structural information from the Rietveld refinement and additionally to calculate scattering density maps to reveal the important details of the structure.

## II Synthesis and sample characterization

Four samples of HgBa2CuO4+_d_ (_A_, B, C, and _D_) were synthesized from stoichiometric mixtures of Ba2CuO3+_x_ and HgO according to methods described in Ref. 12. The synthesis was carried out at 800 degC for 6 h in evacuated silica tubes in a two-temperature gradient furnace. Samples A, C, and D were annealed at controlled partial oxygen pressures, created by a mixture of Co3O4/CoO and CuO/Cu2O oxides (for sample _D_) situated in the hotter part of the tubes. Samples A (_m_ = 2.09 g) and C (_m_ = 1.93 g) were obtained at _p_(O2) = 0.15 bar; sample D (_m_ = 1.84 g) was obtained at _p_(O2) = 0.0012 bar. In the case of sample B (_m_ = 2.05 g), an additional pellet of Ba2CuO3+_x_ was placed in the hot part of the tube (820 degC) to decrease the partial mercury pressure. Samples thus synthesized were then annealed for more than 24 h in a flow of oxygen at 250 degC (_C_ and _D_), argon at 350 degC (_A_), and under oxygen pressure as high as 90 bars at 250 degC (_B_).

Phase composition of the samples was determined from x-ray powder data (Guinier FR-552 focusing camera, Cu_Ka_1 radiation, l = 1.540 56 A, Ge internal standard). Samples A, B, C contained only the Hg-1201 phase, with the exception of traces of the starting Ba2CuO3+_x_ phase found with the main Hg-1201 phase in sample D.

To check chemical composition of one of the monophase samples obtained at the same conditions and with cell parameters close to sample C, its full chemical analysis was carried out in MPI (Stuttgart). Hg, Ba, and Cu concentrations were determined by the ICP-AES technique, and total oxygen content by the "solid-state hot-gas" method (crystal SiO2 as an internal standard). It gave good agreement with a stoichiometric cation composition: Hg0.99(1)Ba2.00(1)Cu0.99(1)O4.03(6).

The formal oxidation state of copper was determined by iodometric titration, described in Ref. 18. Based on the iodometric data, the formal charges of copper atoms were _V_Cu=+2.02 (sample _A_), +2.25 (_B_), +2.16 (_C_) with statistical errors of 0.02. The formal oxidation states of the other atoms was assumed to be standard: _V_Hg=_V_Ba=+2 and _V_O=-2. In this case, the chemical formulas of the studied compounds can be written as HgBa2CuO4.01(1) (_A_), HgBa2CuO4.1(1) (_B_), HgBa2CuO4.08(1) (_C_). Sample D was not investigated by this method due to the presence of impurities which were detected by x rays. The oxygen content of all samples including sample D was refined then in a neutron-diffraction experiment.

  transitions for samples A and B is not sharp, probably due to an inhomogeneous distribution of the extra oxygen, the temperature of the sharp drop in _kh_ was assumed as the transition temperature, namely, T_{c} = 71 K (_A_), 83 K (_B_), 98 K (_C_) and 96 K (_D_).

Measurements of EPR spectra for samples A and C were performed on the 3-cm range E-4 (Varian) EPR spectrometer. Powder patterns with ~1-_m_m particle sizes were used for the measurements. This allowed the skin effect on the EPR spectra to be excluded, because of the thickness of the skin layer at the working frequency of the spectrometer (9.18 GHz), for a sample with a resistivity of several mOhm cm is about 10-20 _m_m. EPR spectra were measured at room temperature in a range of magnetic fields up to 4000 Gs, at microwave frequency power of 20 mW, with modulation amplitude of magnetic field of 8 Gs and frequency modulation of 100 kHz.

## III Neutron Diffraction

Neutron-diffraction experiments were performed with the high-resolution Fourier diffractometer[19] (HRFD) at the IBR-2 pulsed reactor in Dubna and with the constant wavelength diffractometer 3T2 at the Orphee reactor in Saclay. The HRFD diffractometer is a time-of-flight (TOF) correlation spectrometer using a fast-Fourier chopper for modulating the intensity of the incident neutron beam and the RTOF method for gathering scattered neutrons. The HRFD _d_-spacing resolution depends on the frequency of the intensity modulation, and in the experiments with HgBa2CuO4+_d_ it was close to D_d_/_d_ = 0.0015. The 3T2 (_l_ = 1.227 A) is a high-resolution powder diffractometer (D_d_/_d_ is close to 0.003 at the minimum of the resolution curve for 10' collimator before sample), equipped with 20 ^{3}He detectors.

A cylindrical, 5-mm-diam, Ti-Zr sample holder without coherent scattering was used to hold the Hg-1201 powder. Diffraction patterns were measured with HRFD for samples A -_D_ at room temperature and for sample B at T = 8 K. The 3T2 was used for measuring the diffraction pattern of sample A at T = 293 and 8 K.

For samples A, B, and C, all diffraction lines corresponded to the well-known Hg-1201 structure with the tetragonal P4/_mmm_ space group. No attributes of extraneous phases were obtained, confirming the high quality of these samples. For sample D, weak peaks (intensities were less than 1% of the strongest peak) of the Ba2CuO3+_x_ phase were found in the spectrum.

Data processing was performed by the Rietveld method using the m stria (Ref. 20) and fullprof (Ref. 21) programs for diffraction patterns from HRFD and 3T2, correspondingly. For the coherent scattering length, we used[22] 12.69, 5.07, 7.718, and 5.803 fm (1 fm = 10-13 cm) for Hg, Ba, Cu, and O, respectively. The absorption correction was calculated using the tabulated absorption and incoherent scattering cross sections. For the HRFD spectra the influence of absorption was noticeable for d >= 1.8 A (_l_ >=3.5 A). The lattice parameter calibration was done using the Al2O3 NIST standard SRM-676. Rietveld structural analysis of the HRFD spectra was performed on the d_{l} interval from 0.81 to 2.09 A, with 110 diffraction peaks of Hg-1201, using the starting parameters as given in Ref. 3. Figure 2 shows an example of these refinements (_d_ >=0.12, sample _C_). The diffraction patterns measured on the 3T2 diffractometer were refined for the interval of 6deg<= d >=126deg with ~150 peaks. The refinements were performed for the z coordinates of Ba and O2 (oxygen in the apical position), the occupancy factors of Hg and O3 (oxygen in the center of the Hg plane), and for the thermal factors of all atoms except the O3 atom. In the final refinement, the thermal factor of copper was kept fixed [_B_(Cu)=0.5] to reduce the influence of systematic errors on the occupancy factor analysis.

## IV Results and Discussion

### Structure data for Hg-1201

The initial refinement was carried out assuming full occupancy of the mercury positions. The results are presented in Table 2, together with the relevant bond distances. The good correspondence between the data for sample A, which were obtained on two diffractometers and by using different refinement programs, can be noted.

On the whole, the listed results are in good agreement with the Hg-1201 structure data published in Refs. 4-9, and especially with the data of a recent neutron-diffraction study.[6] All of the known features of the Hg-1201 structure and, specifically, the dependence on temperature and oxygen content mentioned in Refs. 4-6, are confirmed.

The decrease in the a and c lattice parameters was 0.008 (0.009) and 0.025 (0.027) A, respectively, for sample A (_B_) as the temperature decreased to 8 K. The shortening of the c axis in sample A is mainly the result of the shortening of the Cu-O2 bond distance, while both Cu-O2 and Hg-O2 distances decrease in the same degree in sample B.

For the samples with various extra oxygen contents, there is a correlation between d and the value of the lattice parameters and some interatomic bonds. The Cu-O1 in-plane distance and the Cu-O2 apical distance decrease if d increases, while the Hg-O2 distance increases (Fig. 3). The significant dependence of the Cu-O2 and Ba-O3 apical bonds on extra oxygen should be stressed. The overall contraction of the c

  lattice parameter is only 0.008 A over a range of d from d  0.06 (sample _A_) to d = 0.19 (sample _B_), while both the Cu-O2 and Ba-O3 distances decrease by ~0.03 A. As a result the interlayer distance between the Ba and O2 layers decreases greatly (by ~0.06 A). Qualitatively, this can be interpreted on the basis of the Coulomb splitting model, suggested in Ref. [23], as a positive charge transfer to the CuO2 layer when the oxygen content increases in the HgO_d_ layer.

### Occupation of mercury positions

As shown in Table 2, the temperature factors of Hg and O2, which form a dumbbell configuration of Hg-O2 are quite large. The same unexpectedly large values of these parameters were found in Refs. [4]-[8]. Thermal motion gives an essential contribution to the thermal factors, because at T = 8 K, the value _B_(Hg), for instance, becomes several times smaller in comparison with room temperature, though it stays large. This last effect can indicate some structural disorder or partial occupation of the site. The attempt at structure refinement with disordered Hg sites gave no effect, which means that there is no static displacement. In a joint refinement of Hg occupancy and thermal parameter the coordinates of other atoms do not change but _n_(Hg) and _B_(Hg) are markedly reduced (these new values are also listed in Table 2). These two parameters, _n_(Hg) and _B_(Hg), correlate strongly that do not lead to a conclusion about their real values. In Fig. 4, the dependence of _n_(Hg) on _B_(Hg) is shown, which was obtained in a refinement at fixed values of _B_(Hg) for sample C. The same figure shows the R_{w} factor as a function of _B_(Hg), with a gently sloping minimum at _B_(Hg) = 1.0-1.8 A2 and, accordingly, at _n_(Hg) = 0.9-1.0.

A possible explanation for such a low occupancy factor or the large thermal factor of Hg can be mercury substitution for copper or a carbonate group, as it was suggested in Refs. [5], [7], and [8]. If the condition _n_(Hg) + _n_(Cu/C) = 1 is fulfilled, the refined occupancy factors would be _n_(Hg)  0.9 and _n_(Cu/C)  0.1. The authors of Refs. [5] and [7] have proved the Hg substitution for Cu by the additional extra oxygen atoms located near the middle of the edge of the Hg mesh with an appropriate square coordination for the Cu cations. We tried to find this additional oxygen by calculating the experimental scattering density distribution and drawing maps for the various cross sections of the unit cell. The very high d_{l} reso

The sensitivity of the search can be estimated from Fig. 5, where the difference map of the scattering density for the basal plane of sample A with \delta\approx0.06 is shown. The scattering density maximum of the O3 atom can be clearly seen. The amplitude of its peak is \sim2.5 times larger than the most intensive background maxima. This means that atoms with coherent scattering lengths close to that of oxygen (for instance, carbon) would be found if occupation of their positions in the structure is close or higher than 3%. The (1/2,y,z) cross section of the Fourier map for sample C is shown in Fig. 6. One can see that in the positions 1/2,0,z (z\approx 0.04) and 1/2,y,0 (y\approx 0.08), where additional oxygen was found in Refs. 5 and 7, no real peaks are present. It should be noted that we did not see any static disorder of the O3 atom along the diagonal that was found in Ref. 7.

Thus, the additional O4 atom and, consequently, the noticeable substitution of Hg for Cu were not present in our samples and we can now conclude that the large value of _B_(Hg) and _B_(O2) are the consequence of large oscillations of the HgO_{2} fragment as a whole. It should be mentioned once more that the chemical analysis performed with one of our samples showed a practically stoichiometric cation composition and, consequently, confirmed an absence of noticeable cation replacement. The same conclusion was made in Ref. 6 on the basis of structural data, and in Ref. 24 where the studies of Hg_{1-x}Cu_{x}Ba_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} samples obtained under high pressure of 1.8 GPa were carried out. This agrees also

  with the right temperature dependence of _B_(Hg) and _B_(O2) although the x-ray-absorption fine-structure (XAFS) data [25] did not show large amplitudes of Hg-O bond movement, due to its high covalence.

The other additional effect that can raise the value of _B_(Hg) is the deficiency of Hg positions at the surface of the Hg-1201 grains, which was found in Ref. 26 for quenched samples. To some degree, this is proved by comparing the results obtained for samples C and D, which were synthesized at different oxygen partial pressures (0.15 and 0.0012 bar) and then annealed under the same conditions. The different oxygen partial pressures in a closed volume during the synthesis of Hg-1201 lead to the different mercury partial pressures, which was higher for sample D. This means that this sample should be more Hg deficient than sample C. Indeed, the c axes of these two samples are different, while the a parameters are the same. It is interesting to note that sample D has a lower T_{c} value that can also be a consequence of the cation stoichiometry violation.

### Extra oxygen position occupation and its influence on T_{c}

Special attention was made to the extra oxygen O3 occupancy refinement. The small amount of extra oxygen in the structure does not allow its thermal parameter to be determined accurately. The problem is alleviated by the small correlation between O3 occupancy and thermal parameter. The variation of _B_(O3) over a large range [parameter refinement with different fixed _B_(O3) values] did not change d more than one standard deviation (Fig. 7). The much stronger correlation shown in Fig. 4 was found between _n_(Hg) and _B_(Hg), but changing these values did not vary the d value. Refinements done with and without the absorption correction caused an alteration of less than 0.01 for the d value.

The _n_(O3) parameters are listed in Table 2, they were obtained with fixed _B_(O3)=1 A2. These occupancy parameters are significantly smaller than those determined by Huang _et al._[6] for the HgBa2CuO4+_d_ superconductors with close _T__c_'s (curves 2 and 3 in Fig. 8). A shift in the two T_{c}(_d_) dependencies from each other with d  0.05 can be easily seen. The T_{c}(_d_) dependence for our samples where the d content was determined by iodometric titration, assuming _V_Ba=_V_Hg + + 2, _V_O = - 2 is shown also in Fig. 8. The additional experimental data obtained by this analysis for other Hg-1201 samples synthesized under similar conditions are depicted in Fig. 8 by the same sign (+).

The paraboliclike dependencies are shifted from each other along the d axis. The maximum discrepancy in the d values for the samples with close _T__c_'s exists between the iodometric data and the neutron-diffraction data from Ref. 6. The estimated hole concentration for the Hg-1201 sample with maximum T_{c}, based on thermoelectric power data was found to be +2.16 (Ref. 11) and it fits well with our iodometric data. However, the thermoelectric power technique allows only the hole concentration in the (CuO2) layers to be estimated, while the iodometric titration determines the overall hole concentration and does not distinguish the holes between the different structural fragments: the (CuO2) layers or the Hg or O atoms, etc. The discrepancies between the neutron-diffraction and thermoelectric power data were explained in Refs. 6 and 11 as that, for every extra oxygen inserted, one hole in the (CuO2) layers is created while its formal charge becomes -1. Self-consistent local-density-approximation calculations performed for the Hg-1223 structure revealed strong covalence between Hg and interstitial oxygen, [27] which decreases significantly the doping level of the (CuO2) layers in comparison with that expected from formal ionic consideration. However, chemical analysis, which determines the overall hole concentration, in the case of the optimally doped Hg-1201 phase, must reveal the hole concentration p = 0.32. Our experimental data for the samples with maximum _T__c_'s were much lower (_p_ = 0.16 or

  V_{\rm Cu}\!=\!+2.16), and this fact creates some doubts about the assumption of the O3 formal charge being equal to -1.

The presence of the O^{-} anion in the Hg-1201 structure, located far from the cations, (d_{\rm Hg\!\!-\!O3}=2.75 A and d_{\rm Ba\!\!-\!O3}=2.84 A) should provide a response in the EPR spectra due to the unpaired electron. The EPR spectra (first derivative of the absorption signal) normalized by the amplifier coefficient K_{\rm ampl} and the mole number N_{\rm mole} of the reduced sample A and sample C treated in an oxygen flow are shown in Fig. 9. In the same figure, the 1000-times-reduced EPR spectrum of Y_{2}BaCuO_{5} is shown. This structure has an unpaired electron in the Cu^{2+} cation and was used as a standard. All spectra exhibit large g-factor anisotropy: g_{\perp}\!=\!2.04\!\pm\!0.02 and g_{\parallel}\!=\!2.23\!\pm\!0.02, which is typical for powdered samples of compounds with Cu^{2+} cations in their structure in an axial-symmetric coordination.

Due to the low intensity of the EPR signals of the Hg-1201 samples, and practically the same line shape and width for all three of the samples studied, an estimation of the paramagnetic centre concentration was made using A_{\rm norm}\!=\!A/(K_{\rm ampl}\!\times\!N_{\rm mole}) and was compared with A_{\rm norm} for Y_{2}BaCuO_{5}. The values thus obtained (number of unpaired electrons per formula unit) are 3.5\times10^{-4} for sample C and 1.4\times10^{-4} for sample A. Such a small number of paramagnetic centers (more than 400 times smaller than the extra oxygen concentration) and a shape specific to the Cu^{2+} cations, the width of the signals and the values of the g factors, allow us to conclude that the EPR signals from the O^{-} anions are absent. However, this phenomenon can be attributed to the covalent interaction between Hg and extra oxygen, as it was revealed in Ref. [27]. The origin of the weak EPR signals can be due to local defects in the Hg-1201 structure or to small amounts of impurity phases (not found by XRD analysis) containing Cu^{2+} cations.

Additional confirmation of the absence of O^{-} anions in the Hg-1201 structure is the much lower \delta value obtained in Refs. [4] and [9] and in the present work in comparison with the data from Ref. [6]. It should be noted that for the second member of the series, HgBa_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{6+\vartheta},[9, 28, 29] whose structure has one type of Cu cation in a pyramidal coordination, the optimal \delta value as calculated for one (CuO_{2}) layer is also smaller and equals \delta2=0.11 for all of the compounds studied.

## V Conclusions

The realized study of monophase HgBa_{2}CuO_{4+\delta} samples with different \delta and T_{c} at the neutron high-resolution diffractometers allowed new precise structural information to be obtained, including thermal atomic parameters and extra oxygen concentration.

Scattering density maps were calculated to find the possible appearance of additional atoms in the Hg layer, with the exception of the O3 atom located in the middle of the mesh. We conclude that no significant replacement of Hg cations by others takes place and no additional extra oxygen atoms near the middle of the edge were found in our particular samples of the Hg-1201 phase. The large value of the temperature factors of Hg and O2, which form a dumbbell configuration of Hg-O_{2}, are the consequence of large oscillations of this fragment as a whole.

The determined T_{c}(\delta) dependence exhibits a parabolic-like behavior similar to that found in previous works,[6, 8, 10, 11] and it agrees with the iodometric analysis data. However, these curves are shifted apart along the \delta axis, an especially large shift is between the neutron-diffraction data from Ref. [6] and the iodometric data. The probable reason can be that despite the high accuracy of the neutron data [standard deviation of the n(O3) is about 0.01], the real error can be significantly larger and cause a systematic shift from the real n(O3) value. First of all, the large discrepancies in extra oxygen content can be due to distinct cation composition of Hg-1201 phases studied by different groups. In this case the T_{c} values are determined not only by oxygen content, but by a range of cations replacement also.

From our analysis, including the analysis of correlation between occupancy and thermal factor of the O3 atom, we believe that systematic error for oxygen content in our samples does not exceed 0.02. A small additional reason of \delta shifting towards to a higher value can be extra oxygen inhomogeneity in the sample, leads to the polyphase state of a sample. Such phenomenon of macroscopic phase separation, due to low-temperature extra oxygen diffusion, was studied already in detail both for powdered samples[30] and single crystals[31] of La_{2}CuO_{4+\vartheta} The presence of incoherent scattering domains with different amounts of the extra oxygen in the crystallites of the sample can lead to a higher value of \delta if the refinement was done using the single phase model. But, such effects cannot be strong. The 15% broadening of the reflections in the studied Hg-1201 samples, in comparison with the experimental resolution function of the diffractometer, supports the anion inhomogeneity hypothesis. In turn, the iodometric data may be shifted to smaller \delta due to the possible presence of amorphous impurity phases in the sample.

Taken into account these factors, we can conclude that the optimal \delta values for the Hg-1201 superconductor are in the range \delta=0.08-0.12. The large discrepancy of our data with the \delta values determined in Ref. [6] (where \delta=0.18 was found) is not clear. The hypothesis of the O3 formal charge being equal to -1 causes some doubts and cannot explain this discrepancy. We think that the probable reason for overestimation of the O3 content can be due to the phenomena discussed above or due to an insertion of the additional "non-oxidizing" oxygen atoms into the structure, located in the

  {\rm CO}_{3}^{2-} groups, as was suggested in Ref. 8, or in the OH (H_{2}O) groups.

Additional neutron-diffraction experiments of monophase Hg-based superconductors, especially with large amounts of extra oxygen, e.g., HgBa_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{6+\delta}, will allow important information to be obtained concerning the mechanism of hole creation in this superconducting series. The data obtained in the present work (neutron-diffraction, iodometry, EPR) support the traditional mechanism of hole creation in the conducting band, with a concentration close to 2\delta.
