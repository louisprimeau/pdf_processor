###### Abstract

Bulk magnetization, transport, and neutron scattering measurements were
performed to investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of a
polycrystalline sample of the newly discovered ferromagnetic
superconductor, CeO_(0.3)F_(0.3)BiS₂. Ferromagnetism develops below
T_(FM) = 6.54(8) K and superconductivity is found to coexist with the
ferromagnetic state below T_(SC)∼ 4.5 K. Inelastic neutron scattering
measurements reveal a very weakly dispersive magnetic excitation at 1.8
meV that can be explained by an Ising-like spin Hamiltonian. Under
application of an external magnetic field, the direction of the magnetic
moment changes from the c axis to the ab plane and the 1.8 meV
excitation splits into two modes. A possible mechanism for the unusual
magnetism and its relation to superconductivity is discussed.

## 1 Introduction

The recently discovered BiS₂-based superconductors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] share
many common characteristics with other unconventional superconductors,
such as the cuprates and iron-based superconductors. Prevalent in theses
system is the presence of a square lattice in their layered structure
and superconductivity induced by doping charge carriers [1, 2, 6, 7].
The superconducting (SC) mechanism in the new BiS₂-based superconductors
is still under debate. While electron-phonon coupling constant
calculations [8, 9, 10] yield a T_(SC) close to the experimental value,
suggesting a conventional phonon mediated mechanism, no significant
change in the phonon density of states has been observed across the
superconducting transition of the LaO_(0.8)F_(0.5)BiS₂ system [11]. In
contrast, other experimental [12, 13, 14, 15] and theoretical results
[16, 17, 18] suggest an unconventional superconducting mechanism may
exist in this system. Conventional superconductivity with s-wave Cooper
pairing would be destroyed in the presence of magnetism by the orbital
effect [19] and/or the paramagnetic effect [20, 21]. Therefore, studying
the relation of superconductivity to magnetism would provide important
information on the nature of the superconducting mechanism.

CeO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ exhibits ferromagnetism and superconductivity at
low temperatures [5, 22, 23], thus providing a good system to
investigate the superconducting mechanism of the BiS₂ materials. The
coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity deserves attention
on its own because actual systems exhibiting such coexistence are quite
rare. Examples include some heavy fermion superconductors [24, 25, 26,
27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], Ruthenate-layered
cuprates [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38],
Eu(Fe_(1 − x)Co_(y))₂(As_(1 − x)P_(x))₂[39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44], and
CeFe(As_(1 − y)P_(y))(O_(1 − x)F_(x)) [45, 46, 47, 48].

Layered superconductors are typically composed of alternating
superconducting and blocking layers [1, 2, 49, 50]. The superconducting
layers serve as a conducting path of charge carriers [49] which become
superconducting below the transition temperature, and the blocking
layers are insulating spacers sandwiched between superconducting layers.
The interplay between the superconducting and blocking layers and its
impact on superconductivity has been of great interest in cuprates and
pnictide superconductors. Recently the R_(c)T_(m)P_(n)O system (R_(c):
rare earth; T_(m): transition metal; P_(n): pnictogen) [51] has shown
diverse electronic and magnetic properties depending on the T_(m)P_(n)
blocking layers. Experimental systems in this category includes a
ferromagnetic Kondo system CeRuPO [52], a correlation-enhanced local
moment antiferromagnet CeNiAsO [53], and superconducting LaFePO [54].
Recent work examining LnOBiS₂ systems (Ln = La, Nd, Ce, Pr, Yb) [2, 3,
4, 5, 55] show that superconductivity occurs in the BiS₂ layer. Density
functional calculations [1, 16] also find Bi-6p and S-3p bands close to
the Fermi level. In CeO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂, the blocking layers are formed
by magnetic Ce ions separating the superconducting BiS₂ layers. It is
important to examine how the two layers interact with each other.

In this paper, the crystal and magnetic structures and magnetic
fluctuations in the superconducting CeO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ are examined as
a function of temperature and magnetic field. Even though the crystal
symmetry is P4/mmm, broadening of the nuclear Bragg peaks is present,
indicating poor crystallinity. Below T_(FM)≈ 6.5 K, the Ce³⁺ magnetic
moments align ferromagnetically along the c axis, and a spin-wave mode
around ℏω≈ 1.8 meV appears. The spin-wave can be described by a
three-dimensional (3D) Ising spin Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor and
next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Application of a magnetic field
leads to a spin flop to the ab plane while the ℏω≈ 1.8 meV mode splits
into two excitations. These atypical changes with applied magnetic field
could be explained by considering the Ising nature of the Ce magnetic
moment together with imperfect crystallinity. We suggest that
CeO_(1 − x) F_(x)BiS₂ is a ferromagnetic superconductor where rare-earth
layers show Ising ferromagnetism with negligible interaction with
superconducting layers enabling the coexistence of two typically
antagonistic phenomena.

## 2 Experiment

A 1.0 g polycrystalline sample of CeO_(0.3)F_(0.7)BiS₂ was prepared with
a solid-state reaction and then annealed under high-pressure using a
cubic-anvil-type high-pressure machine in air. Bi₂S₃ powders were
obtained by sintering the mixtures of Bi grains and S grains in an
evacuated quartz tube at 500 C for 10 hours. Mixtures of Bi grains,
Bi₂S₃ grains, Bi₂O₃ powders, BiF₃ powders and Ce₂S₃ powders with nominal
compositions of CeO_(0.3)F_(0.7)BiS₂ were ground, pelletized, and sealed
into an evacuated quartz tube. The tube was heated at 800 ^(∘)C for 10
hours. The obtained pellets were ground and annealed at 600 ^(∘)C for 1
hour under a hydrostatic pressure of 3 GPa. The neutron scattering
measurements were performed at the High Flux Isotope Reactor using the
HB2A powder diffractometer [56], and at the Spallation Neutron Source
using the Cold Neutron Chopper Spectrometer (CNCS) [57]. The samples
were loaded into vanadium cans for the diffraction measurements at HB2A
and into an aluminum can for the inelastic measurement at CNCS under a
He atmosphere and mounted on a cryostat. The neutron diffraction data
from HB2A were collected at a constant wavelength of 1.5408 A at 2 K and
20 K. The inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements at CNCS were
performed with an incident energy E_(i) = 4 meV. For the inelastic
measurements, the background was determined and subtracted from the data
using an empty can measurement.

## III Susceptibility and Resistivity

Shown in Fig. 1 are the low-temperature bulk magnetization and transport
property measurements as a function of an external magnetic field.
Figure 1(a) shows DC magnetic susceptibility with zero field cooling
(ZFC) and field cooling (FC) at various fields ranging from 10 to 1000
Oe. Upon cooling, the magnetic susceptibility, χ, gradually increases at
T ≈ 8 K, as shown in the differential susceptibility plot in the inset.
This indicates the development of ferromagnetism consistent with the
previous report [5]. A linear extrapolation of the high magnetic field
data to 0 T is shown in Fig. 1(b). This provides estimates of the
spontaneous magnetic moment, a magnetic moment in zero applied external
field, of 0.52 μ_(B)/Ce and 0.11 μ_(B)/Ce at 2 and 5 K, respectively.
The magnetic moment is quite smaller than what is expected from 4f¹
electron of Ce³⁺[58].

Further cooling leads to a rapid drop in χ at T_(sc) ≈ 4.5 K due to the
diamagnetism from the Meissner effect where the system exhibits
superconductivity [Fig. 1(a)]. When the external magnetic field is
increased, superconductivity is suppressed, as evidenced by the
weakening of the diamagnetic effect. Figure 1(c) represents resistivity
measured at various field ranging from 0 to 6 T. The suppression of
superconductivity with increasing field is also observed from nonzero
resistivity above 1.6 T. Figure 1(d) shows the superconducting volume
fraction (SVF) as a function of field, estimated by the following
equation: SVF [%] = 4$\pi\times\{\chi(T_{SC}^{\rm onset})-\chi(2$ K}
where $T_{SC}^{\rm onset}$ is the temperature below which the magnetic
susceptibility starts to drop. At zero field, the SVF is over 90

## IV Static Spin Correlations

### Diffraction results

The neutron powder diffraction pattern shown in Fig. 2 is from data
collected on HB2A at T = 20 K. Significant Bragg peak broadening is
observed, indicating that the system is not very crystalline. A similar
observation was previously made in a related system, La(O,F)BiS₂[11],
however the peak broadening is larger in CeO_(0.3)F_(0.7)BiS₂. At the
same time, several impurity phases are present in the sample, with some
unknown. These unknown impurities are unlikely to compromise our result
as their peaks are temperature independent, thus not belonging to the
magnetic phase. Also considering that their summed integrated intensity
corresponds to the 1.4(6) percent of total integrated intensity, it is
likely that the volume fractions of those foreign phases are less than a
few percent. The structural parameters obtained from the refinement are
summarized in Table 1. The intrinsic peak broadening does not allow for
a full refinement including thermal parameters. The main features were
indexed using the P4/nmm space group, and the peaks were fit using an
anisotropic broadening function [60]. A set of possible nonzero
anisotropic strain parameters are S₄₀₀ = S₄₀₄, S₂₀₂ = S₆₀₂, S₆₀₄, and
S₂₂₀, whose refined parameters are summarized in Table 2. The red solid
line shown in Fig. 2 represents the best fit. The inset in the figure
shows the crystal structure obtained. Superconductivity occurs in the
BiS₂ layers [1,16] where the Bi ions form a square lattice and separated
by the Ce(O/F) blocking layer.

As the sample is cooled to ≈ 1.5 K, an enhancement of the neutron
scattering intensity superimposed on the nuclear Bragg intensity is
observed (Fig. 3). Given that the intensity appears at the nuclear
peaks, it is most likely ferromagnetic in nature with a magnetic
propagation vector of k = (000). The increase in intensity is especially
significant at the (102) peak, and its integrated intensity is shown in
the inset as a function of temperature. Upon cooling,
CeO_(0.3)F_(0.7)BiS₂ undergoes a second-order phase transition around
T_(FM) ≈ 7 K. We fit the integrated intensity with a power law above 4
K: I ∝ (T_(FM) − T)^(2β). T_(FM) = 6.54(8) and β = 0.30(7) are obtained
from this comparison. The value of the critical exponent, β, is closest
to the theoretical value of a three-dimensional Ising model [61], which
is 0.326, but given the large error bar, a three-dimensional XY model
(β = 0.345) is also possible.

Given that the nuclear Bragg peaks are very broad and the magnetic
signal is weak, a magnetic structure refinement is not straight forward.
This is especially difficult in a ferromagnet since the magnetic
intensity can be obscured by thermal and/or strain/stress broadening.
Group theoretical analysis is used to determine the possible symmetry
consistent type of magnetic order in this system. In the P4/nmm crystal
space group, there are in total four possible irreducible
representations (IRs) compatible with k = (000): Γ₂, Γ₃, Γ₉, and Γ₁₀.
They represent antiferromagnetic ordering with spins along the c axis,
ferromagnetic ordering with spins along the c axis, ferromagnetic
ordering with spins in the ab plane, and antiferromagnetic ordering with
spins in the ab plane, respectively.

The model magnetic neutron patterns for each IR together with their
corresponding spin configurations are shown in Fig. 4. In the case where
spins are lying along the c axis such as in Γ₂ and Γ₃, there cannot be
any (00L) magnetic Bragg peaks because only spin moments that are
orthogonal to the wave vector can contribute to the scattering
intensity. The strongest peaks are the (100) and (101) in the
antiferromagnetic spin configuration of Γ₂, while the (102) peak is the
strongest peak

solid line shows the difference between measured and fitted intensities.

in the ferromagnetic spin configuration of Γ₃. On the other hand, if the
spins are in the ab plane as in Γ₉ and Γ₁₀, (00L) peaks are allowed. In
the ferromagnetic configuration of Γ₉, the (001) magnetic Bragg peak is
clearly the strongest peak. In the antiferromagnetic configuration of
Γ₁₀, the (001) is still the strongest peak while the (002) peak is
comparable in intensity.

Since the increase of the measured magnetic scattering is prominent at
(102), it can be deduced that the magnetic structure is of the Γ₃ type,
as it shows ferromagnetic ordering of the Ce³⁺ magnetic ions along the c
axis. It is unlikely for other IRs to be mixed with Γ₃, as a small
component along the c axis, whether AFM or FM, would have produced
significant scattering at (001), which is not observed in the data.

### Elastic measurements

Measurements at CNCS allowed us to reach a lower Q value which showed
the presence of the (001) nuclear peak at 0 T as shown in Fig. 5(a). No
difference was observed at the two temperatures measured for zero
applied field for T = 1.5 and 10 K, which suggests that the intensity
under this peak is nuclear.

As shown in Fig. 1(a), an external magnetic field suppresses
superconductivity. Figure 5(a) shows the Q dependence of the elastic
neutron scattering intensity integrated over ℏω from −0.5 to 0.5 meV at
T = 1.5 K with varying field. It can be seen that the ferromagnetic
intensity at the (102) Bragg peak does not show significant change with
field. On the other hand, a notable effect under field is observed with
the appearance of an elastic magnetic signal at the (001) reflection. In
addition, a broad intensity peak is observed at low Q, below 0.5 A⁻¹,
that shows little temperature dependence and becomes less pronounced
with field as in Fig. 5(c). This is likely related to the reduced
crystallinity of the sample that may give rise to domains with some
domains having short-range correlations. The integrated intensity of the
(001) Bragg peak as a function of magnetic field is shown in Fig. 5(b)
at T = 1.5 K  < T_(FM) and at 5.5 K just below T_(FM). A similar
behavior under field is observed at both temperatures, where the
intensity increases gradually up to 4 T. The field-induced (001)
magnetic peak indicates that the spin configuration changes from the
ferromagnetic alignment along the c axis, Γ₃, at zero field to
ferromagnetic alignment in the ab plane, Γ₉, under applied magnetic
field.

We can estimate the ratio of in-plane magnetic moment and c axis
magnetic moment by comparing the intensity of Q= (001) and Q= (102) as
in Table 3. A gradual increase of in-plane magnetic moment with field is
observed. It should be noted that when the moment direction rotates from
the c axis to the ab plane and the size of moment is fixed, the (102)
intensity should decrease. On the other hand, if an ab-plane moment is
induced while the c-axis moment remains fixed, the (102) peak will
increase. Our measurements as shown in Fig. 5 (c) indicate slight
increase but only within error bars. The details regarding how much the
intensity will change are determined by the amount of induced ab-plane
moment and decrease of c-axis moment. It is, however, hard to extract
the absolute size of magnetic moment from our neutron diffraction data
due to large broadening.

magnetic structures and their simulated neutron scattering intensities.

analysis was done using the program sarah[62] and the number of IRs

order of the Ce moments for each IR.

intensity at T = 10 K at zero field is shown to demonstrate that Q=
(001) intensity is purely nuclear at zero field. This intensity is

visualization. (c) The field dependence of the quasielastic scattering

## V. Inelastic measurements

### A. Spin fluctuation

In order to investigate how the magnetic correlations evolve through the
magnetic phase transition at T_(FM) ∼ 6.5 K, inelastic time-of-flight
neutron scattering measurements were performed at several different
temperatures spanning T_(FM). To see the magnetic signals below T_(FM)
more clearly, the T = 10 K  > T_(FM) data were subtracted as a
background in our analysis. At 1.4 K, we find the emergence of a strong
and flat excitation centered at ℏω = 1.8 meV, as shown in Figs. 6(a) and
6(c). Upon warming, the 1.8 meV excitation stays flat up to about 4 K
and starts decreasing in intensity to vanish above 8 K [see Fig. 6(d)].
The T dependence is similar to that of the FM Bragg peak intensity,
indicating the 1.8 meV mode is most likely a ferromagnetic spin wave.

The simplest Hamiltonian that reproduces all important characteristics
of the spin excitation is the anisotropic exchange spin Hamiltonian:

H = ∑_(i, j)J_(i, j){αS_(i)^(x)S_(j)^(x) + αS_(i)^(y)S_(j)^(y) + S_(i)^(z)S_(j)^(z)} + gμ_(B)∑_(i)B⃗ ⋅ S⃗_(i)
(1)

where J_(i, j) and B are the exchange integral and the external magnetic
field, respectively. S⃗_(i) is the spin operator at the position r_(i),
and S_(i)^(y) represents the v = x, y, z component of the spin. g is the
Lande g factor, and μ_(B) is the Bohr magneton. The first term describes
anisotropic interactions between the magnetic moments where the degree
of anisotropy is controlled by α , and the second term gives rise to the
Zeeman effect from the external magnetic field. α < 1, α > 1, and α = 1
cases correspond to Ising-like, XY-like, and Heisenberg spins,
respectively. For the exchange interactions, nearest neighbor (NN) and
next-nearest neighbor (NNN) have been considered. The bond length for
the interlayer J₁ and that of the intra-layer J₂ coupling are 4.010(30)
A and 4.038(1) A, respectively.

This Hamiltonian can be solved analytically, and the eigenenergies are
the following:

$$\begin{split}\epsilon&=-4J_{1}S-4J_{2}S+2\alpha J_{ 2}S(cosk_{x}+cosk_{y})\\ &\quad\pm 2|\alpha J_{1}S|\sqrt{1+cosk_{x}+cosk_{y}+cosk_{x}cosk_{y}}+g \mu_{B}B_{z}.\end{split}$$
(2)

Here, k_(x), k_(y), and k_(z) correspond to the Miller indices of a
reciprocal wave vector. The theoretical neutron scattering intensities
were calculated and averaged over all solid angles to simulate the data
obtained from the polycrystalline sample. The best result was obtained
with parameters J₁ = J₂ = −0.24 meV with α = −0.1, as shown in Fig.
6(b). These values suggest that the main interaction between magnetic
moments is ferromagnetic and very Ising-like. We note that the Ising
nature is consistent with the result we obtained from power-law fitting
of the magnetic order parameter. The negative value of anisotropy
parameter, i.e., antiferromagnetic x − y interactions, was needed to
produce the up-turn of the excitation mode at low Q.

### B. Field dependence

The magnetic excitations change as a function of applied field as shown
in Figs. 7(a)-7(c). The H = 3 T data [Fig. 7(b)] show that the magnetic
field smears out the 1.8 meV mode. The energy cut of the data from 1.3
to 2.8meV shows that, under field, the 1.8 meV mode splits into two
peaks, one of which remains nearly at the same starting energy, while
the other peak moves to higher energy as the external field increases
[Fig. 7(c)]. This behavior is clearly seen in Fig. 7(d) where we plot
the Gaussian peak positions [see Fig. 7(c)] as a function of H at
T = 1.5 K.

neutron scattering intensity in reciprocal wave vector (Q) and energy

## VI Discussion

In the absence of an external magnetic field, the spins in
CeO_(0.3)F_(0.7)BiS₂ are aligned along the c direction with a strong
Ising-like exchange anisotropy. The application of field introduces a
magnetic component in the _ab_ plane suggesting that there exists a
strong _ab_-plane magnetic susceptibility compared to a weak _c_-axis
susceptibility. A similar anisotropic magnetic susceptibility was
previously observed in a Ce-based intermetallic compound, CeAgSb₂[63,
64]. The latter system has a tetragonal crystal structure as well and
shows ferromagnetic ordering along the c axis below _T_(c)_ = 9 K. This
system shows a linear increase of the in-plane magnetization when H∥
(100), whereas the magnetization along the c axis remains the same when
H∥ (001). After intense debate, it has been determined that the magnetic
state of this system can be described by spins in the |±1/2⟩ crystal
electric field (CEF) split ground state with anisotropic ferromagnetic
exchange interactions [65, 66, 67, 68]. The larger in-plane component of
J_(x, y) than J_(z) of the ground state is responsible for the
anisotropic susceptibility. The magnetic moment of the ground state
arises from g_(J)μ_(B)J_(z) = 0.41μ_(B) where g_(J) is the Lande g
factor for Ce³⁺, and this value is close to our magnetic moment
estimated from Fig. 1(b). Considering the same crystallographic space
group, ferromagnetic structure, small magnetic moment, and Ising nature
of spin interaction, we believe the same physics can apply to our system
as well. In this picture, the increase of in-plane magnetic moment comes
from the grains where the external field is applied in the _ab_
direction. Future experiment with a single-crystal sample would be
necessary to confirm this scenario.

The split of the ferromagnetic spin wave under an external magnetic
field is quite unusual for a monoatomic ferromagnet that has only one
spin wave mode. Under an external magnetic field, a single spin wave
dispersion is expected to shift by the Zeeman energy, gμ_(B)HS, if the
moments are aligned parallel to the field. Thus, the origin of the
_H_-induced splitting of the 1.8 meV mode into two is likely due to the
presence of several magnetic domains.

A possible explanation for the origin of the split can be a
spin-glass-like disorder of the transverse spin components arising from
local atomic distortions with spontaneous magnetization along the c
axis. Such a magnetic ground state is called asperromagnetism [69] and
is usually found in amorphous crystal structures such as
Fe${}_{100\sim$B_(x)[70] or CeNi_(0.4)CuO_(0.6)[71]. Strong random local
anisotropy with a wide distribution of the exchange interactions can be
a sufficient condition for the onset of asperromagnetism. It should be
noted that the large broadening of the nuclear Bragg peaks shown in Fig.
2 indicates a strong lattice disorder. The broad background near
Q = (001) in which the intensity is reduced under the magnetic field is
also consistent with the spread of magnetic moments around the c axis.
The fluctuation energy of the perpendicular spins will not change with
the external magnetic field, and these moments are likely the ones
contributing to the lower-field-insensitive mode.

Lastly, the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in this
system deserves special attention. From our measurements, we did not
observe any change in either the magnetic structure or excitation upon
entering the superconducting phase. The spin Hamiltonian most applicable
to our system suggests that the inter-layer coupling is negligible. This
may indicate that the coexistence of ferromagnetism and
superconductivity is made possible by the electronic separation of the
superconducting layer and the magnetic layer, for instance, as in the
case of EuFe₂As₂[43, 44, 72, 73, 74]. This is further supported from
density functional calculations on the superconducting
CeO_(0.3)F_(0.5)BiS₂, which suggest that the rare-earth band is isolated
away from the Fermi surface [75]. In the CeFeAs${}_{1\sim$P_(x)O system,
for comparison, heavy fermion behavior at x > 0.9 is explained by
interlayer hybridization between Fe-3d and Ce-4f electrons, and
reduction of this coupling leads to the onset of ferromagnetism [54]. A
recent Ce L₃-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy experiment on
CeO_(1 − x)F_(x)BiS₂ also suggested reduced hybridization between the
Ce-4f orbital and Bi-6p conduction band in the superconducting F-doping
region [76] due to structural displacement of S ions. The authors
claimed that the reduced hybridization can be responsible for onset of
both ferromagnetism in the Ce(O,F) layer and superconductivity in BiS₂
layer. It should be noted, however, that it is also possible that the
pairing symmetry is unconventional, as in a spin-triplet pairing [18],
enabling a mutually supportive coexistence between them. The pairing
state of superconductivity in this system remains unclear and calls for
further studies.

## VII Conclusion

We have studied the nature of magnetism in the rare case of a
ferromagnetic superconductor in CeO_(0.3)F_(0.7)BiS₂. The neutron powder
diffraction shows broadening of the nuclear Bragg peaks suggesting an
imperfect crystalline structure as in other compounds in the new
BiS₂-based superconducting

family [11, 77]. The magnetic structure investigation showed that the
magnetic moments are aligned ferromagnetically along the c axis below
T_(M) ≈ 7 K. Upon application of an external magnetic field, the
ferromagnetic component develops in the ab plane. From inelastic neutron
scattering measurements, it is shown that the Ising-like spin
Hamiltonian with NN and NNN interactions can best describe the observed
spin wave near E ≈ 1.8 meV. An external magnetic field splits the
spin-wave into two modes: one excitation increases in energy while the
other remains nearly at the same energy. The anomalous phenomenon
observed under field is discussed in terms of CEF and aseromagnetism,
both of which are related with an Ising-like spin nature. In this new
ferromagnetic superconductor, there seems to be little interaction
between the ferromagnetic and superconducting layers.
