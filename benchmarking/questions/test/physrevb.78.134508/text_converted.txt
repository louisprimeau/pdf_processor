## I Introduction

Since the discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in iron-based layered
quaternary compound LaFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x),¹ a group of high-temperature
superconductors have been discovered. For example, in the electron doped
region the highest critical temperature _T_(c)_= 55 K was found in
SmFeAsO_(0.9)F_(0.1),² while in the hole-doped region superconductivity
at _T_(c)_= 25 K was first found in La_(1 − x)Sr_(x)FeAsO (Ref. [3]) and
later _T_(c)_= 38 K (Ref. [4]) in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂. At the same
time extensive efforts have been devoted to study the nature of this
generation of high-temperature superconductors. Among them, very high
upper critical field was inferred through high-field measurements in
these iron-based superconductors,⁸ which indicates encouraging potential
applications. Low temperature specific heat,⁶ point-contact tunneling
spectrum,⁷ lower critical field,⁸ nuclear magnetic resonance⁹ (NMR),
etc. revealed unconventional pairing symmetry in the superconducting
state. Theoretical calculations pointed out that the superconductivity
in these iron-based superconductors may emerge on several disconnected
pieces of the Fermi surface,¹⁰ ⁻ ¹⁴ thus exhibiting multigap effect.
Many experiments have already shown that these superconductors exhibit
multiband features.^(5, 8, 15) Spin-density-wave order and structural
distortion were observed in undoped LaOFeAs system.¹⁶ ⁻ ¹⁸ All these
experimental and theoretical works indicate an unconventional
superconducting mechanism in this system. To get a deeper insight into
the superconducting mechanism, it becomes very essential to know the
normal-state properties. Unfortunately almost all the transport data so
far in the normal state were taken from polycrystalline samples, this
casts big doubts in drawing any solid conclusions. This situation
becomes very serious in the layered system, such as the iron-based
superconductors. Recently our group has successfully fabricated single
crystals of NdFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (_x_ = 0.18) with
_T${}_{c}^{\rm onset}$_= 50 K,¹⁹ so it becomes possible to measure the
intrinsic transport properties of these iron-based superconductors. Here
for the first time we report the measurements of Hall effect and
magnetoresistance on NdFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) (_x_ = 0,0.18) single
crystals. Our data provide intrinsic and detailed information about the
electron scattering in the normal state.

## II Experiment

The crystals were made by flux method using NaCl as the flux, and the
detailed process of sample preparation was given elsewhere.¹⁹ The
surface of the crystal looks rather flat. X-ray diffraction pattern
taken on one single crystal shows only (00l) peaks and the full-width at
the half maximum (FWHM) of the (003) peak is only 0.12^(∘), indicating
good crystallinity. We made electric contacts on them using the Pt
deposition method of the focused-ion-beam (FIB) technique. As shown in
the insets of Fig. 1, crystals with six Pt leads are shown and the
longitudinal and transverse resistance can be measured at the same time.
The measurements were carried out on a physical property measurement
system (PPMS) (Quantum Design) with magnetic fields perpendicular to the
_ab_ plane of the samples and up to 9 T. The current density during the
measurement was about 400−500 A/cm². The in-plane longitudinal and the
Hall resistance were measured by either sweeping the magnetic field at a
fixed temperature or sweeping the temperature at a fixed magnetic field.

## III Experimental Results and Discussions

In Fig. 1(a), the resistive transitions of two superconducting samples
were shown. The superconducting (SC) NdFeAsO_(0.82)F_(0.18) samples have
very sharp transitions, i.e., the onset transition temperatures are
about 50 K and the transition width is less than 2 K (90

### Magnetoresistance and Hall effect of superconducting
NdFeAsO_(0.82)F_(0.18) crystals

It is known that the magnetoresistance (MR) is a very powerful tool to
investigate the electronic scattering and the message of the Fermi
surface. For example, in MgB₂, a large magnetoresistance was found which
is closely related to the multiband property.[21; 22] Figure 2(a) shows
the field dependence of MR for SC sample II. Here we define the
magnetoresistivity as Δρ=ρ(H) − ρ₀, where ρ(H) is the longitudinal
resistivity at a magnetic field H and ρ₀ is that at zero field. It can
be observed that the MR is very weak, i.e., less than 0.5

Figure 2: (Color online) (a) Field dependence of MR Δρ/ρ₀ for SC sample
II at different temperatures. The inset shows the plot by following
Kohler’s law at different temperatures, one can see that Kohler’s law is
not obeyed. (b) Temperature dependence of MR at 9 T. One can see that
the MR is rather small and decreases rapidly with increasing
temperature. Above about 175 K, the MR becomes negligible in our
measurement resolution.

superconducting (SC) NdFeAsO_(0.82)F_(0.18) single crystals (a) and one
NdFeAsO single crystal (b). The insets show the scanning electron
microscope (SEM) picture of SC sample I and undoped sample with the
electric contacts of Pt metal made by focused-ion-beam technique for the
resistance and Hall measurements. The solid line in (b) shows the
theoretical fitting by Eq. (3) which gives the SDW energy gap about 1082
K (see text).

scattering rate 1/π(T) ∝ ρ₀(T), here f and F represent some unknown
functions. For MgB₂, Kohler’s law is not obeyed because of the multiband
property.[21] Here we tried the scaling based on Kohler’s law to the
data from the single crystal (SC sample II), the result is shown in the
inset of Fig. 2(a). Clearly, the MR data measured at different
temperatures do not overlap and Kohler’s law is not obeyed in this
material. This discrepancy may suggest that in this material there is
multiband effect or the basic assumption for Kohler’s law 1/π(T) ∝ ρ₀(T)
may not be satisfied. Through the following analysis, we will see that
the latter may be more plausible.

For a normal metal with Fermi liquid feature, the Hall coefficient is
constant versus temperature. However, the Hall coefficient varies with
temperature for a multiband material, such as MgB₂,[22] or a sample with
non-Fermi liquid behavior such as the cuprate superconductors, e.g., in
Ref. [26]. In the found iron-based superconductors, R_(H) varies with
temperature in polycrystals.[15, 27] People may question that the
temperature dependence of R_(H) observed in polycrystalline samples do
not show an intrinsic property, since the electric current flows
randomly in different directions on different grains, which gives rise
to complexity in interpreting the Hall effect. In the present work, the
Hall resistance was carefully measured on NdFeAsO_(1 − x)F_(x) single
crystals, and this concern can be removed completely. The inset of Fig.
3 shows the raw data of the transverse resistivity ρ_(xy) at different
temperatures, which is in good linear relation against the magnetic
field. In Fig. 3, the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficients
R_(H)  = ρ_(xy)/μ₀H were plotted, which decay continuously with
increasing temperature and behave in almost the same way in the two
samples. The value of R_(H) at 400 K is about 20 times smaller than that
at 55 K.

A straightforward interpretation to the violation of Kohler’s law and
the strong temperature dependence of R_(H) would be the multiband
effect, especially if it is true when one assumes an almost balanced
contribution of electron and hole pockets. This, however, contradicts
the following facts. In a simple two band model, MR can be expressed as
follows by omitting the higher-order terms of B = μ₀H

$$\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho_{0}}\simeq\frac{\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})^{ 2}B^{2}}{\left(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2}\right)^{2}},$$
(1)

where σ₁  = n_(i)e² /m_(i) and μ_(i)  = eτ/m_(i) are the conductivity
and the mobility of the ith band, respectively, with n_(i) and m_(i)
meaning the charge-carrier density and the effective mass of the ith
band, respectively. The Hall coefficient can be expressed as

$$R_{H}\simeq\frac{\sigma_{1}\mu_{1}+\sigma_{2}\mu_{2}}{\left(\sigma_{1}+\sigma_ {2}\right)^{2}}.$$
(2)

If assuming the sample that we investigate here has comparable
contributions from electron pocket and hole pocket, the
magnetoresistance should be quite strong as in MgB₂. This is actually
not the case. Band structure calculations[10, 13, 28] also show that
when doping the parent phase ReFeAsO with more than 10

Figure 3: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient
R_(H) for the two superconducting samples. Strong temperature dependence
of Hall coefficient with a negative sign can be seen obviously. The
inset shows a good linear relation between ρ_(xy) and magnetic field at
different temperatures for sample II.

Bear this idea in mind, we can actually understand the violation of
Kohler’s law very well. The basic requirement for Kohler’s scaling law
is 1/ τ(T) ∝ ρ₀(T), this should not give problems when dealing with a
metal with one band and a weak temperature dependent density of states
(DOS). However, when the DOS is changing with temperature, Kohler’s law
is certainly not followed. Assuming that the two electron pockets are
the major players of electron conduction in our case, the electrons have
slightly different mass m₁ and m₂ on these two bands, but the
charge-carrier density n₁ and n₂, and τ₁ and τ₂ are roughly equal to
each other, from Eq. (1) we have  Δρ/ρ₀ ≈ 1/4(e² τΔm/m)²B²  with
 Δm= m₁ − m₂. Thus one expects that (Δρ/ρ₀)^(1/2) ∝ τ. In Fig. 4(b), we
accumulate the τ values calculated in different ways. First the 1/ τ_(H)
calculated from the Hall angle cot θ_(H) is proportional to T^(2, 6) as
mentioned before. This may tell the intrinsic message for the electron
scattering in the normal state. Then the 1/ τ_(tr) calculated from
resistivity exhibits a complicated structure which may reflect a
combined result of both the true scattering rate 1/ τ_(H) and the
temperature dependent DOS. It is found that the magnetoresistance
$({\Delta}\rho/\rho_{0})^{-1/2}\,{\propto}\,1/\,\tau_{\rm MR}$ scales
also with the power law T^(2, 6) which suggests (Δρ/ρ₀)^(1/2) ∝ τ_(H).
This consistent analysis reveals that a more reasonable picture to
understand the transport data on the single crystals is to assume _a
depletion of DOS in lowering temperature_, at least this is part of the
reason for the strong temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient
R_(H).

The depletion to DOS in lowering temperature is actually a common
feature in correlated materials. In cuprate superconductors, this effect
is associated with a term "pseudogap" in the normal state, which has
been observed by many tools. In the present iron-based superconductors,
pseudogap has actually been already inferred from the NMR and
photoemission data.[9; 29; 30] In Fig. 5, based on the single band model
(assuming the two electron bands are highly degenerate), we calculate
the temperature dependence of the charge-carrier density
n = [1/ eR_(H)]. It should be mentioned that the temperature dependence
of R_(H) in the iron-based system is much stronger than that in the
hole-doped cuprate, where the most accepted picture is the partial
gapping of Fermi surface by the pseudogap effect. In the iron-based
superconductors, in order to explain the very small magnetoresistance
and the strong temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_(H), the
picture concerning partial gapping on the Fermi surface seems necessary.

### MR and Hall effect of undoped NdFeAsO

The properties of the undoped samples are very different from the
superconducting ones, which can be found from the resistive curves shown
in Fig. 1. A well accepted picture to understand the resistivity anomaly
at about 150 K is the formation of a SDW gap.[16] To analyze the data at
temperatures below the SDW transition, we tried the theory given by
Andersen and Smith,[31]

$$\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{2}+BT(1+2T/\Delta){\rm exp}(-\,\Delta/T).$$
(3)

Here, ρ₀ is the residual resistivity, A and B are the fitting
parameters; the T² term describes the Fermi liquid behavior, while the
last term describes the metallic ferromagnet or antiferromagnet state
(e.g., Ref. [32]) with an energy gap Δ. The curve at temperatures from
40 to 140 K can be well fitted by the expression [see the solid line in
Fig. 1(b)], and an SDW energy gap Δ ≈ 1082 K is derived.

The SDW state is very interesting and worth further investigation. In

verse resistivity were shown. The MR effect is very strong at low
temperatures, and the magnitude is as large as 30

### Comparison between the undoped NdFeAsO and the superconducting
NdFeAsO_(0.82)F_(0.18)

From the results mentioned above, the F doping weakens the SDW and the
structural phase transition and finally generates superconductivity
beyond a certain doping level.

Figure 8: (Color online) Differential of ρ [from Fig. 1(b)], MR [from
Fig. 7(a)], and R_(H) [from Fig. 7(b)] versus T. Two anomalies could be
seen at the temperatures of about 140 and 155 K, which may correspond to
the SDW and the structural phase transitions, respectively.

Figure 6: (Color online) Field dependence of MR (a) and transverse
resistivity (b) for the undoped sample at different temperatures. Large
MR effect and a little nonlinear Hall effect can be found in the undoped
sample.

Figure 7: (Color online) Temperature dependence of MR (a) and Hall
coefficient R_(H) at μ₀H= 9 T. The inset of (b) shows the magnitude of
nonlinear Hall effect expressed by [R_(H)(9T) −R_(H)(0T)]/R_(H)(0T).

However, the situation at high temperatures above the two transitions is
still unknown. It would be very interesting to have a comparison between
properties of these two very different samples. For that the Hall
coefficient of the undoped sample and R_(H)/2.2 for two superconducting
samples are shown in Fig. 9. Although the absolute value of R_(H) of the
superconducting sample is about two times larger than that of the
undoped sample, it is surprising to see that the R_(H) for two samples
can be nicely scaled with a simple multiplication of 2.2 for R_(H) of
the undoped sample from 175 K all the way up to 300 K. This suggests
that both the undoped non-superconducting samples and the doped
superconducting samples may have quite similar Fermi surfaces with
different charge-carrier densities in high-temperature region. This
gives support to the theoretical calculation that the charge doping may
not shift the Fermi energy too much, but rather lift off the very
condition for the formation of the SDW.[34] This is a very important
conclusion which suggests that the rigid-band model is certainly
insufficient to explain the doping effect. On the other hand, one can
see that the temperature dependence of resistivity is very different for
the two samples in the same temperature region, indicating a very
different electron scattering mechanism. A deeper insight to this issue
is very interesting and will be carried out in the future investigation.

## IV Summary

In summary, for the first time the MR and Hall effect have been
investigated on single crystals of superconducting
NdFeAsO_(0.82)F_(0.18) samples and undoped nonsuperconducting NdFeAsO
ones. A strong temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient R_(H) has
been found up to 400 K for both samples although a greatly enhanced
R_(H) was observed below about 155 K for the undoped one. It is further
found that the MR for the superconducting sample is very weak in the
normal state and does not obey Kohler’s scaling law. A picture
concerning the partial gapping to the density of states at the Fermi
surface can consistently explain the dilemmatic phenomenon: strong Hall
effect (as well as strong temperature dependence) but very weak
magnetoresistance the superconducting sample. For the undoped samples,
however, a very strong magnetoresistance was observed in low-temperature
region, which could be due to the multiband effect or the electronic
scattering with the magnetic moment. The SDW gap about 1082 K for
undoped NdFeAsO is derived from the ρ-T curve for the first time. Two
step transitions are observed from the transport properties including
ρ(T), MR, and R_(H)(T) which change their behaviors at about 155 and 140
K. These two transitions are in accord very well with the structural
phase transition and the SDW formation. The Hall coefficient R_(H) for
both undoped and superconducting samples at temperatures above 175 K
show very similar behavior, which suggests the similar Fermi surfaces
for both systems and the inapplicability of the rigid-band model in
explaining the doping effect.
