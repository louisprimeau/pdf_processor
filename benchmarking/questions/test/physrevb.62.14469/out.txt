###### Abstract

We present measurements of the temperature and magnetic field (_B_ext<0.2 T) dependences of the transverse-field muon spin relaxation rate taken on polycrystalline samples of the layered superconductors Y2C2X2, X = Br,I, and the binary carbide YC2. The aim of these investigations was to determine the magnetic penetration depth l(_T_) which is a fundamental parameter of the superconducting state. The magnetic-field dependence of the muon-depolarization rate below T_{c} is discussed. An analysis of the temperature dependence of the depolarization rates allows qualitative conclusions regarding the strength of the electron-phonon coupling in the compounds under investigation. The dependence of the transition temperature on the condensate density of the halide-carbide superconductors is compared to that of other exotic superconductors.

## I Introduction

In the past decades, superconductors with layered crystal structures were intensively investigated, because they display a variety of unusual electronic properties. The most prominent examples are the high-_T__c_ cuprate systems which exhibit exceptionally high transition temperatures at optimal doping. In the tantalum and niobium dichalcogenides and their intercalated derivatives a transition between quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional anisotropic superconductivity could be achieved by tuning the layer distances.[1, 2] Also the organic superconductors which exhibit a charge transfer from the separating layers to the conducting layers attracted much interest despite their modest transition temperatures.[3, 4]

While an explanation for the observed behavior in these systems based on a microscopic theory is still lacking, there appears to be general agreement that basically two effects dominate the electronic properties in these "exotic" materials: First, the layered crystal structures give rise to a pronounced anisotropy of their electronic properties. Band-structure calculations reveal bands with low dispersion ("flat bands") which establish a structured electronic densities of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. When two flat bands cross with opposite curvature to form a saddle point at the Fermi surface the DOS diverges with a logarithmic curvature. The occurrence of such a "Van-Hove singularity" causes dramatic consequences on the electronic properties, e.g. deviations from Fermi-liquid behavior may be expected due to enhanced electron correlations.[5, 6] Second, in all of the "exotic" systems the charge carrier densities in the normal state are low. Therefore, charge screening which is effective in normal metals on a length scale of some A  is reduced and electron correlations become pronounced over an extended length scale. These effects also influence the order parameter in the superconducting state. If the coherence length \xi_{\bot}(0) is much smaller than the layer spacing, the order parameter becomes quasi-two dimensional.[2] The subscripts \parallel and \bot indicate an orientation parallel and perpendicular to the layers in the structure of the corresponding compounds, respectively. The amplitude of the order parameter is related to the superconducting charge carrier density _n_s and the superconducting properties are assumed to be strongly affected by phase fluctuations if the superconducting charge carrier concentration is reduced below a certain limit.[7, 8] This statement was evidenced in the T_{c} vs \sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) plot by Uemura _et al._,[9, 10] which shows a linear dependence of the transition temperature on the transverse-field muon spin relaxation (TF-_m_SR) depolarization rates \sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) <= _n_s for many exotic superconductors.

In this contribution we present TF-_m_SR investigations on the layered carbide halides Y2C2X2, X = Br,I, and their three-dimensional relative YC2. The aim of our experiments was to evaluate the magnetic-field penetration depth l which is one of the fundamental parameters of the superconducting state. In clean-limit superconductors 1/l2 is proportional to the superconducting carrier density _n_s divided by their effective mass _m_*. For the determination of absolute values for the magnetic penetration depth and condensate densities TF-_m_SR measurements provide a powerful tool.[11] The present investigations have been performed on polycrystalline powder samples of the superconductors YC2 and the highly anisotropic Y2C2X2 because no single crystals of suitable size and quality are available to our knowledge.

The crystal structures of the Y2C2X2 compounds consist of closely packed yttrium metal atom bilayers which are sandwiched between sheets of halogen atoms (Fig. 1). Quasi-molecular C2 dumbbells occupy octahedral voids to form Y6C2 units condensed into layers which are surrounded by halogen atom layers. Such _X_-Y-C2-Y-_X_ layered units stack and form a structure with monoclinic symmetry. A detailed discussion of the stacking sequences and lattice properties of the rare-earth carbide halides can be found in Ref.12. The layered compounds Y2C2X2 are structurally related to the superconducting carbide YC2. The latter compound consists of a three-dimensional network of the same Y_{6}C_{2} units.[13, 14]

Since the discovery of superconductivity in the rare-earth carbide halides Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2}, considerable work has been devoted to an understanding of their physical behavior in the superconducting state.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] Extensive investigations have revealed a variety of characteristic properties. For example, in the Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{2-x}I_{x} series a pronounced peak in T_{c}(x) was observed at a bromine to iodine ration of 1:3 (x = 1.5), see Ref. [22]. For Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{0.5}I_{1.5} the transition temperature reaches 11.6 K, which is close to the T_{c}'s of the organic or Chevrel-phase superconductors. The superconducting states of the compounds Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{2} (T_{c} = 5.04 K), Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} (T_{c} = 9.97 K), and Y_{2} (T_{c} = 4.05 K) have been investigated in great detail by means of C_{P}(T,B) and M(T,B) experiments.[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] These experiments reveal an enhanced electron-phonon coupling in the halide superconductors while YC_{2} exhibits textbook-like BCS weak-coupling behavior. The layered compounds Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} were found to be high-\kappa superconductors (\kappa \approx 60 for Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2}) and have critical fields of B_{c2}= 3 \div 0.2 T and B_{c2}= 11.8 \div 0.2 T for the bromine and iodine compounds, respectively. For Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} an anisotropy ratio of the coherence length of \gamma = \xi_{\parallel}/\xi_{\perp} = 5.2 \div 0.2 was derived from magnetic ac-susceptibility investigations on single crystals. The in-plane and out-of-plane coherence lengths of \xi_{\parallel} = 133 A and \xi_{\perp} = 26 A considerably exceed the lattice constants. Therefore, the superconducting order parameter of Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} is strongly anisotropic but still extends across several layer units. On the other hand, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter of the binary carbide YC_{2} is close to the type-I limit (\kappaGL \approx 1), and the critical field B_{c2}= 60 \div 10 mT is much reduced compared to those of the carbide halides.[14, 17, 28]

Band structure calculations with the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital TB-LMTO method indicate that an overlap of antibonding C_{2}-\pi* molecular orbitals with energetically neighboring Y-d states is responsible for the metallic character of the Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} , see Ref. [22]. This coexistence is evidenced by the short C-C bond distance of 128 \div 2 pm, Ref. [18]. The band-structure calculations also reveal a pronounced peak in the electronic density of states close to the Fermi energy due to a saddle point at the Fermi surface in Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{2}. The Fermi energy falls in a region where the DOS decreases with a positive curvature with increasing energy. This finding is supported by ^{13}C-NMR experiments, which show deviations from a linear temperature dependence of the Korringa relaxation[25] and the pressure dependence of T_{c} in the Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} series.[26] The structure in the DOS has been discussed to be of significant importance for the superconducting state in the yttrium carbide halide materials.[21, 22, 23]

## II. Sample preparation and characterization

Single phase samples of Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} were synthesized by reacting stoichiometric amounts of yttrium metal chips (99.999% Johnson-Matthey), YOX free YX_{3} salts and graphite powder (Aldrich Chemie). YX_{3} was prepared as reported in Ref.[27] and purified by sublimating YX_{3} several times in high vacuum in an especially designed tantalum container. The ingredients were sealed in tantalum crucibles and reacted at 1300 K for several days. The reaction was terminated by quenching the samples to room temperature.[20] The precursor materials and the products are sensitive to air and moisture. Therefore, all procedures were carried out in a dried argon or helium gas atmosphere. The YC_{2} sample was prepared by arc-heating of stoichiometric quantities of yttrium metal chips and graphite pieces (Deutsche Carbone 99.999%) in dried argon gas atmosphere. Subsequently, the pellets were sealed in tantalum crucibles and annealed at temperatures between 1200 and 2300 K for 10 days.

All samples under investigation were characterized by x-ray diffraction measurements to prove phase purity and to compare the crystallographic data with the literature[12, 20] (see Table 1). dc magnetization measurements were performed to check the superconducting properties, e.g., the transition temperatures, magnetic shielding, and Meissner fraction.

The lattice parameters of the investigated yttrium carbide halide samples agree with the literature data within experimental error. No additional lines due to impurity phases were found. The diamagnetic shielding is complete in all yttrium carbide halide samples and the Meissner fraction typically reaches 30% of full magnetic shielding. The YC_{2} sample used in the \muSR experiments exhibits a lower transition temperature T_{c} = 3.85 K as reported previously in Ref.[14]. Moreover, the c-lattice parameter of the investigated sample is reduced with respect to that which has been found in samples with a transition temperature of T_{c} \approx 4.0 K. A comprehensive analysis of the sample characteristics and the dependence on the preparation conditions has led to the conclusion that local carbon defects of about 2.5%/C are responsible for the observed reduction of T_{c} and the shortening of the c-lattice parameter in our sample.[14] Therefore, the present yttrium dicarbide sample is assigned as YC_{2} - \delta in the following, with \delta\approx 0.05. Relying on this fact we conclude that our

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & a & b & c & \beta \\ Compound & (pm) & (pm) & (pm) & (deg) \\ Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{2} & 695.4(1) & 376.5(1) & 993.1(1) & 99.99(2) \\ Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{0.5}I_{1.5} & 715.3(2) & 385.2(1) & 1038.4(2) & 93.90(4) \\ Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} & 721.7(1) & 288.3(1) & 1043.

  {\rm YC}_{2-\delta} sample is not in the clean limit which has to be taken into account for the interpretation of the TF-\muSR data in Sec. IV.

## III The TF-\muSR experiments

A comprehensive discussion of the TF-\muSR technique is provided in Ref. 29, and the used instruments are described in detail in Ref. 30. Here, we give only a brief description of the method, which is necessary for an understanding of the data analysis. The TF-\muSR experiments above (below) T = 2 K were performed using a standard ^{4}He gas-flow cryostat (^{3/4}He dilution cryostat) at beamline \piM3, both at the Paul-Scherrer-Institut in Villigen, Switzerland. _In situ_ pressed disc-shaped pellets of 10 mm diameter and about 2 mm thickness were sealed in especially designed sample holders made of high purity silver. The pellets were enclosed in dry helium gas behind a 100 \mum Mylar window to avoid exposure to water and oxygen. The samples were fixed with small amounts of dried silicon grease to guarantee thermal contact to the environment. After cooling the sample in an external field of B_{\rm ext}= 0.1 T to temperatures below T_{c} in order to induce a homogeneous flux line lattice (FLL), positive muons with initial spin polarization \vec{P}_{\mu}(t\!=\!0) transverse to the external field B_{\rm ext} were implanted. The muons come to rest at interstitial lattice sites which are yet unknown for the present compounds. However, since the characteristic length \lambda of the FLL is significantly larger than the lattice parameters, the implanted muons are randomly distributed throughout the FLL field profile. Each muon spin starts to precess in its local field with the Larmor frequency \omega_{\mu}\!=\!\gamma_{\mu}B_{\rm loc} ( \gamma_{\mu}\!=\!2\pi\!\cdot\!135.5 MHz/T). After an average lifetime of \tau = 2.2 \mus the muons decay emitting positrons preferably into the direction of the muon spin \vec{P}_{\mu}(t). The resulting asymmetric positron-emission rate N_{e^{+}}(t) includes all the information on the precession frequencies and depolarization rates of \vec{P}_{\mu}(t). The Fourier transform F(\omega_{\mu}) of N_{e^{+}}(t) yields the distribution of the precession frequencies of the muon spins and thus of the FLL field profiles. For polycrystalline samples typically almost symmetric Gaussian-shaped distributions F(\omega_{\mu}) are detected (see inset of Fig. 2) for which the second moments \langle\Delta\omega_{\mu}^{2}\rangle may be extracted by fitting the TF-\muSR time spectra P_{\mu}(t) by an exponential term \exp(-\sigma_{\rm eff}^{2}t^{2}/2) (for the definition of \sigma_{\rm eff} see Ref. 32) as is shown in Fig. 2. Here, the depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm eff} of the initial muon-spin polarization P_{\mu}(0) is proportional to the second moment of the frequency distribution \sigma_{\rm eff}\alpha\langle\Delta\omega_{\mu}^{2}\rangle. The magnetic penetration depth of a polycrystalline type-II superconductor can be evaluated from the depolarization rate:

\[\sigma_{\rm FLL}(T) (\mu s^{-1}) = \sqrt{\sigma_{\rm eff}^{2}(T)-\sigma_{\rm nuc}^{2}}\] (1) \[= 1.072\times 10^{5}\lambda_{\rm poly}^{-2}(T)\ \ ({\rm nm}),\]

wherein nuclear contributions \sigma_{\rm nuc} to the effective muon depolarization have been subtracted. [29] In order to check the reliability of the \lambda values obtained from the time spectra P_{\mu}(t) we additionally analyzed the Fourier transforms F_{\mu}(\omega). Figure 2 displays the time spectrum of a data set recorded with the {\rm Y}_{2}{\rm C}_{2}{\rm I}_{2} sample at T\!=\!3.0 K in an external field of B_{\rm ext}= 150 mT. The good agreement of Gaussians with the recorded time spectra is evidenced in the inset of Fig. 2.

In highly anisotropic superconductors, the flux lines are no longer in direction of the external field but are almost aligned parallel to the layers. Therefore, the second moment of the frequency distribution has a dominant contribution of the in-plane component of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\parallel}, and the equation

\[\lambda_{\rm poly}\!=\!1.23\times\lambda_{\parallel}\] (2)

was shown to hold for \gamma\!=\!\lambda_{\perp}/\lambda_{\parallel}\!\!>\!5, Ref. 31. The depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm FLL} of the initial spin polarization measured on polycrystalline samples of a highly anisotropic type-II superconductor provides therefore a direct measure of the in-plane penetration depth \lambda_{\parallel} and hence of the ratio of the superconducting condensate density n_{s} to the effective mass m_{\parallel}^{\rm g}

\[\sigma_{\rm FLL}[\mu s^{-1}] = 7.086\times 10^{4}\lambda_{\parallel}^{-2}\ \ ({\rm nm})\] (3) \[= 2.51\times 10^{-21}\frac{m_{e}}{m_{\parallel}^{\rm g}}n_{s}({ \rm cm}^{-3}).\]

It is known that a nearly symmetric and Gaussian line shape should be expected in polycrystalline samples due to random orientations of the grains of a superconductor with strongly anisotropic properties and the variation of the magnetization in the grains, [34] as it is in the present investigation (see Fig. 2). The influence of unusual flux states, pinning, and flux dynamics, however, cannot be directly gained (as they can in single-crystal materials), and these may induce systematic uncertainties in the second moments \langle\Delta\omega_{\mu}^{2}\rangle derived from \muSR data on polycrystalline samples. For example, the vortex-core radii and thus the field distributions of the vortices may be strongly field and temperature dependent as it is known for the layered superconductor NbSe_{2} (see  Ref. [35]). These systematic uncertainties have been the reason for objections to the interpretation of \muSR data on polycrystalline samples by means of a simple Gaussian analysis.[36] Therefore we emphasize that the quoted errors in \lambda(0) only relate to the statistical errors of the Gaussian analysis, and do not consider model-dependent uncertainties.

However, a systematic error in the second moment of the field distribution \langle\Delta B_{\rm loc}^{2}\rangle and \sigma_{\rm eff}\propto\langle\Delta\omega_{\rm sf}^{2}\rangle of 25% due to the influence of pinning effects or unusual flux states, would induce a variation of only 7% in the resulting penetration depth values.[29] Thus, despite all shortcomings mentioned above, there is reasonable consistency between the \sigma(0) and \lambda_{\parallel}(0) values that have been derived from TF-\muSR experiments on polycrystalline or single-crystalline samples of some cuprate superconductors.[29, 33, 37]

## IV Results and Discussion

In all investigated carbide superconductors we observed one distinct temperature dependent TF-\muSR depolarization rate which clearly proves the existence of a FLL over the total sample volume.

In the following, the experimental results of the TF-\muSR investigations are discussed. First, the field dependences of the depolarization rates \sigma_{\rm FLL} of YC_{2-\delta} and Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} recorded at T = 2.1 K are compared. From an analysis of \sigma(T = 2.1 K,B_{\rm ext}) data a field regime is found for which the London limit holds and the evaluation of \lambda is reliable. The subsequent measurements of the temperature dependences of the depolarization rates have been performed within these field ranges. The \lambda(T) data are compared to results of previous C_{P}(T,B) investigations which reveal a strong electron-phonon coupling in the Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} systems. From an extrapolation \sigma_{\rm FLL}(T \rightarrow 0), the superconducting charge carrier densities are obtained. These results are discussed in the scheme of the T_{c} vs \sigma_{\rm FLL}(0)-plot which reveals a linear relation of T_{c} and \sigma_{\rm FLL}(T \rightarrow 0)\propton_{s}/m_{\rm sf}^{\parallel} in the underdoped regime of the high-T_{c} cuprates and other exotic superconductors.[10]

### The field dependence of the depolarization rate

Equation (2) has been shown to be only meaningful if the external magnetic field B_{\rm ext} is within a range where the second moments of the field distribution \langle\Delta B_{\mu}^{2}\rangle\propto\langle\omega_{\rm sf}^{2}\rangle\propto\sigma_{\rm eff} are independent of the applied field B_{\rm ext}, Refs. [11] and [33]. The dependence of \sigma_{\rm eff} on B_{\rm ext} has been investigated in order to find a field range meeting the requirements of the London model. Figure 3 displays the field dependency \sigma_{\rm eff} for samples of the YC_{2-\delta} and Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} superconductors. Each data point has been obtained from a single time spectrum P_{\mu}(t) which was recorded after cooling the sample in the applied field from temperatures above T_{c} to 2.1 K. Both \sigma_{\rm eff}(T = 2.1 K,B_{\rm ext}) curves exhibit a cusp in the low-field range. For the Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} sample, \sigma_{\rm eff}(T = 2.1 K,B_{\rm ext}) increases until reaching a maximum value of 1.17\mus^{-1} at B_{\rm ext} \sim 30 mT. Above B_{\rm ext}\approx 80 mT the effective depolarization becomes independent of the applied field. The situation for the YC_{2-\delta} superconductor is more complicated because this compound is very close to the type-I type-II transition [38, 14] (\kappa_{\rm GL}\approx 1) where nonmagnetic impurities and defects quantitatively affect the magnetic phenomena in the superconducting state. In the dirty limit (l\ll \xi) the reduction of the normal-state mean free path l due to defects reduces the coherence length in the superconducting state \xi_{\rm eff}\propto\langle\overline{\xi}_{\rm clean}\cdot l and increases the critical field H_{\rm c2}\propto 1/l^{2}_{\rm eff}, Ref. [39]. The crystallographic characterization of our sample reveals a reduced c-lattice parameter (see Table 1) indicating a carbon deficiency. Also the reduced T_{c} and the higher critical field B_{\rm c2}(T = 2.1K) \approx 130 mT as compared to the results from the clean limit sample [14, 38] give further evidence for the investigated yttrium dicarbide sample to be in the dirty limit (Fig. 3). According to the \sigma_{\rm eff}(B_{\rm ext}) dependence, the applied field for the determination of the London penetration depth \lambda(0) for Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} must be larger than 80 mT, while for YC_{2-\delta} a reliable evaluation of \lambda(0) from Eq. (3) is not meaningful.

The low-field cusp in \sigma_{\rm eff}(B) was observed before for polycrystalline high-T_{c} superconductors.[29] The cusp was explained[40] as due to a pinning-induced distortion of the flux line lattice, which enhances \langle\Delta B_{\mu}^{2}\rangle and results in a higher value for the depolarization \sigma_{\rm eff}. The observation of such a cusp at low magnetic fields implies that pinning effects are weak and negligible at higher fields. This indicates the absence of strong pinning centers, e.g. lattice distortions or impurity phases, and evidences the high-quality and structural homogeneity of the investigated Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} sample.[29]

### The temperature dependence of the depolarization rate

In order to evaluate the London penetration depth from the TF-\muSR depolarization rates \sigma_{\rm eff}, the nuclear contributions \sigma_{\rm nuc} were subtracted according to Eq. (1). Above T_{c} , the internal field distribution is not affected by the FLL and a temperature-independent \muSR depolarization occurs due to the magnetic field induced by nuclear moments. For Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} and YC_{2-\delta} the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) is compared to the theoretical function of BCS theory

\[\frac{\sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)}{\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0)}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{\partial\ln \Delta(t)}{\partial\ln t}},\] (4)

Figure 3: Dependence of the depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm eff}(T = 2.1 K) on the applied magnetic field for Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} (circles) and YC_{2-\delta} (diamonds). The dashed lines were drawn to guide the eye. For Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} the depolarization is nearly constant for external fields above 80 mT. In the case of YC_{2-\delta} no field regime satisfies the requirements of the London limit. The critical field B_{\rm c2}\approx 130 mT of the investigated YC_{2-\delta} sample is higher than that of a clean-limit sample (see text).

  where \Delta(t) is the temperature dependence of the BCS-gap width [41] and t = T/T_{c}. Additionally, a power law

\[\frac{\sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)}{\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0)} = 1 - t^{n}\]

has also been fitted to the data, where n = 4 corresponds to the two-fluid (2FL) model. [42]

The \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) data are in qualitative agreement with the investigations of the specific-heat jump at T_{c}. In the case of YC_{2 - \delta}, the data pass along the theoretical curve of the BCS model for weak electron-phonon coupling, and are fitted by a power law with a power of n = 2.5. However, we note that there is no applied magnetic field to hold the London limit for YC_{2 - \delta} [and thus there is no simple relation between \sigma_{\rm FLL} and the London penetration depth as in Eq. (1)]. Nevertheless, the observed \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) data are in fair agreement with BCS theory assuming a \sigma_{\rm FLL}\propto 1/\lambda_{\rm poly}^{2} relation (see Fig. 4).

For Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2}, the power-law fit results in an exponent of n = 3.1, which is significantly enhanced with respect to that of YC_{2 - \delta}. Here, \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) data have larger values than according to BCS theory and are shifted in the direction of the 2FL model. The large value of the exponent n = 3.1 qualitatively indicates an enhanced electron-phonon coupling in Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2}. The analysis of \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) supports the the heat-capacity data for both samples: According to the analysis of the specific-heat jump at T_{c} using the \alpha model, [43] the gap width of YC_{2} amounts to a value of \alpha = \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 1.82, which is close to the BCS value of \alpha = 1.79 and indicates weak electron-phonon coupling for this compound. [17] On the other hand, a significantly increased gap width of \alpha = \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 2.27 has been reported for Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2}, which implies strong electron-phonon coupling. In the context with the above results it should be mentioned that there is a marked disagreement of the \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) dependence between polycrystalline samples and single crystals of high-T_{c} cuprates, which has not yet been understood. [29; 44] The above results support s-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in all investigated compounds. Final conclusive evidence on the nature of the order parameter, however, can only be gained from investigations on single crystals.

### The London penetration depth

The London penetration depths \lambda(0) of the Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} compounds have been evaluated in the scope of London theory by extrapolating the low-temperature TF-\muSR depolarization \sigma_{\rm FLL}(T \to 0). The values of the London penetration depths, which were taken from polycrystalline samples have been deduced according to Eq. (1) and are compiled in Table 2. In the case of YC_{2 - \delta}, the evaluation of the magnetic penetration depth is not meaningful because there is no field range where the London limit applies (see Chap. IV A). The \lambda(0) values gained from the present \muSR experiments are in excellent agreement with those which were reported from an analysis of the magnetization data for the same Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} compounds. [17] However, the accuracy of the present \lambda(0) values is about one order of magnitude higher (the estimated error about one order of magnitude lower) as for the magnetization measurements reported in Ref. [17].

Investigations of the upper critical field of a Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} crystal yield an anisotropy ratio of \gamma = \xi_{\parallel}/\xi_{\perp} = 5.2 \div 0.2. This value is similar to that reported for fully oxygenated (slightly overdoped) YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - x}, Ref. [45], and Eq. (2) may be used in the case of Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} in order to obtain the in-plane component of the London penetration depths \lambda_{\parallel} = 257\pm 3 nm. With \gamma = 5.2, the out-of-plane value of the penetration depth of Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} amounts to \lambda_{\perp} = 1340 \pm 50 nm.

### The superconducting charge carrier density

The shielding currents of a superconductor penetrate in the length scale of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(0) which is directly related to the superconducting condensate density n_{s}(0)/m* for clean limit superconductors [see Eq. (3)]. Uemura _et al._ were the first to realize that the transition temperatures of the underdoped cuprates when plotted versus the TF-\muSR depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm FLL}(T \to 0)\propto n_{s}(0)/m* fall on a common line. [10] An explanation for this amazing finding was proposed by Emery _et al._[8] who suggested that phase fluctuations of the order parameter in the superconducting state become increasingly pronounced with decreasing con

###### Abstract

We present measurements of the temperature and magnetic field (_B_ext<0.2 T) dependences of the transverse-field muon spin relaxation rate taken on polycrystalline samples of the layered superconductors Y2C2X2, X = Br,I, and the binary carbide YC2. The aim of these investigations was to determine the magnetic penetration depth l(_T_) which is a fundamental parameter of the superconducting state. The magnetic-field dependence of the muon-depolarization rate below T_{c} is discussed. An analysis of the temperature dependence of the depolarization rates allows qualitative conclusions regarding the strength of the electron-phonon coupling in the compounds under investigation. The dependence of the transition temperature on the condensate density of the halide-carbide superconductors is compared to that of other exotic superconductors.

## I Introduction

In the past decades, superconductors with layered crystal structures were intensively investigated, because they display a variety of unusual electronic properties. The most prominent examples are the high-_T__c_ cuprate systems which exhibit exceptionally high transition temperatures at optimal doping. In the tantalum and niobium dichalcogenides and their intercalated derivatives a transition between quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional anisotropic superconductivity could be achieved by tuning the layer distances.[1, 2] Also the organic superconductors which exhibit a charge transfer from the separating layers to the conducting layers attracted much interest despite their modest transition temperatures.[3, 4]

While an explanation for the observed behavior in these systems based on a microscopic theory is still lacking, there appears to be general agreement that basically two effects dominate the electronic properties in these "exotic" materials: First, the layered crystal structures give rise to a pronounced anisotropy of their electronic properties. Band-structure calculations reveal bands with low dispersion ("flat bands") which establish a structured electronic densities of states (DOS) at the Fermi level. When two flat bands cross with opposite curvature to form a saddle point at the Fermi surface the DOS diverges with a logarithmic curvature. The occurrence of such a "Van-Hove singularity" causes dramatic consequences on the electronic properties, e.g. deviations from Fermi-liquid behavior may be expected due to enhanced electron correlations.[5, 6] Second, in all of the "exotic" systems the charge carrier densities in the normal state are low. Therefore, charge screening which is effective in normal metals on a length scale of some A  is reduced and electron correlations become pronounced over an extended length scale. These effects also influence the order parameter in the superconducting state. If the coherence length \xi_{\bot}(0) is much smaller than the layer spacing, the order parameter becomes quasi-two dimensional.[2] The subscripts \parallel and \bot indicate an orientation parallel and perpendicular to the layers in the structure of the corresponding compounds, respectively. The amplitude of the order parameter is related to the superconducting charge carrier density _n_s and the superconducting properties are assumed to be strongly affected by phase fluctuations if the superconducting charge carrier concentration is reduced below a certain limit.[7, 8] This statement was evidenced in the T_{c} vs \sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) plot by Uemura _et al._,[9, 10] which shows a linear dependence of the transition temperature on the transverse-field muon spin relaxation (TF-_m_SR) depolarization rates \sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) <= _n_s for many exotic superconductors.

In this contribution we present TF-_m_SR investigations on the layered carbide halides Y2C2X2, X = Br,I, and their three-dimensional relative YC2. The aim of our experiments was to evaluate the magnetic-field penetration depth l which is one of the fundamental parameters of the superconducting state. In clean-limit superconductors 1/l2 is proportional to the superconducting carrier density _n_s divided by their effective mass _m_*. For the determination of absolute values for the magnetic penetration depth and condensate densities TF-_m_SR measurements provide a powerful tool.[11] The present investigations have been performed on polycrystalline powder samples of the superconductors YC2 and the highly anisotropic Y2C2X2 because no single crystals of suitable size and quality are available to our knowledge.

The crystal structures of the Y2C2X2 compounds consist of closely packed yttrium metal atom bilayers which are sandwiched between sheets of halogen atoms (Fig. 1). Quasi-molecular C2 dumbbells occupy octahedral voids to form Y6C2 units condensed into layers which are surrounded by halogen atom layers. Such _X_-Y-C2-Y-_X_ layered units stack and form a structure with monoclinic symmetry. A detailed discussion of the stacking sequences and lattice properties of the rare-earth carbide halides can be found in Ref.12. The layered compounds Y2C2X2 are structurally related to the superconducting carbide YC2. The latter compound consists of a three-dimensional network of the same Y_{6}C_{2} units.[13, 14]

Since the discovery of superconductivity in the rare-earth carbide halides Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2}, considerable work has been devoted to an understanding of their physical behavior in the superconducting state.[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] Extensive investigations have revealed a variety of characteristic properties. For example, in the Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{2-x}I_{x} series a pronounced peak in T_{c}(x) was observed at a bromine to iodine ration of 1:3 (x = 1.5), see Ref. [22]. For Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{0.5}I_{1.5} the transition temperature reaches 11.6 K, which is close to the T_{c}'s of the organic or Chevrel-phase superconductors. The superconducting states of the compounds Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{2} (T_{c} = 5.04 K), Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} (T_{c} = 9.97 K), and Y_{2} (T_{c} = 4.05 K) have been investigated in great detail by means of C_{P}(T,B) and M(T,B) experiments.[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] These experiments reveal an enhanced electron-phonon coupling in the halide superconductors while YC_{2} exhibits textbook-like BCS weak-coupling behavior. The layered compounds Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} were found to be high-\kappa superconductors (\kappa \approx 60 for Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2}) and have critical fields of B_{c2}= 3 \div 0.2 T and B_{c2}= 11.8 \div 0.2 T for the bromine and iodine compounds, respectively. For Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} an anisotropy ratio of the coherence length of \gamma = \xi_{\parallel}/\xi_{\perp} = 5.2 \div 0.2 was derived from magnetic ac-susceptibility investigations on single crystals. The in-plane and out-of-plane coherence lengths of \xi_{\parallel} = 133 A and \xi_{\perp} = 26 A considerably exceed the lattice constants. Therefore, the superconducting order parameter of Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} is strongly anisotropic but still extends across several layer units. On the other hand, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter of the binary carbide YC_{2} is close to the type-I limit (\kappaGL \approx 1), and the critical field B_{c2}= 60 \div 10 mT is much reduced compared to those of the carbide halides.[14, 17, 28]

Band structure calculations with the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital TB-LMTO method indicate that an overlap of antibonding C_{2}-\pi* molecular orbitals with energetically neighboring Y-d states is responsible for the metallic character of the Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} , see Ref. [22]. This coexistence is evidenced by the short C-C bond distance of 128 \div 2 pm, Ref. [18]. The band-structure calculations also reveal a pronounced peak in the electronic density of states close to the Fermi energy due to a saddle point at the Fermi surface in Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{2}. The Fermi energy falls in a region where the DOS decreases with a positive curvature with increasing energy. This finding is supported by ^{13}C-NMR experiments, which show deviations from a linear temperature dependence of the Korringa relaxation[25] and the pressure dependence of T_{c} in the Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} series.[26] The structure in the DOS has been discussed to be of significant importance for the superconducting state in the yttrium carbide halide materials.[21, 22, 23]

## II. Sample preparation and characterization

Single phase samples of Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} were synthesized by reacting stoichiometric amounts of yttrium metal chips (99.999% Johnson-Matthey), YOX free YX_{3} salts and graphite powder (Aldrich Chemie). YX_{3} was prepared as reported in Ref.[27] and purified by sublimating YX_{3} several times in high vacuum in an especially designed tantalum container. The ingredients were sealed in tantalum crucibles and reacted at 1300 K for several days. The reaction was terminated by quenching the samples to room temperature.[20] The precursor materials and the products are sensitive to air and moisture. Therefore, all procedures were carried out in a dried argon or helium gas atmosphere. The YC_{2} sample was prepared by arc-heating of stoichiometric quantities of yttrium metal chips and graphite pieces (Deutsche Carbone 99.999%) in dried argon gas atmosphere. Subsequently, the pellets were sealed in tantalum crucibles and annealed at temperatures between 1200 and 2300 K for 10 days.

All samples under investigation were characterized by x-ray diffraction measurements to prove phase purity and to compare the crystallographic data with the literature[12, 20] (see Table 1). dc magnetization measurements were performed to check the superconducting properties, e.g., the transition temperatures, magnetic shielding, and Meissner fraction.

The lattice parameters of the investigated yttrium carbide halide samples agree with the literature data within experimental error. No additional lines due to impurity phases were found. The diamagnetic shielding is complete in all yttrium carbide halide samples and the Meissner fraction typically reaches 30% of full magnetic shielding. The YC_{2} sample used in the \muSR experiments exhibits a lower transition temperature T_{c} = 3.85 K as reported previously in Ref.[14]. Moreover, the c-lattice parameter of the investigated sample is reduced with respect to that which has been found in samples with a transition temperature of T_{c} \approx 4.0 K. A comprehensive analysis of the sample characteristics and the dependence on the preparation conditions has led to the conclusion that local carbon defects of about 2.5%/C are responsible for the observed reduction of T_{c} and the shortening of the c-lattice parameter in our sample.[14] Therefore, the present yttrium dicarbide sample is assigned as YC_{2} - \delta in the following, with \delta\approx 0.05. Relying on this fact we conclude that our

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & a & b & c & \beta \\ Compound & (pm) & (pm) & (pm) & (deg) \\ Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{2} & 695.4(1) & 376.5(1) & 993.1(1) & 99.99(2) \\ Y_{2}C_{2}Br_{0.5}I_{1.5} & 715.3(2) & 385.2(1) & 1038.4(2) & 93.90(4) \\ Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} & 721.7(1) & 288.3(1) & 1043.

  {\rm YC}_{2-\delta} sample is not in the clean limit which has to be taken into account for the interpretation of the TF-\muSR data in Sec. IV.

## III The TF-\muSR experiments

A comprehensive discussion of the TF-\muSR technique is provided in Ref. 29, and the used instruments are described in detail in Ref. 30. Here, we give only a brief description of the method, which is necessary for an understanding of the data analysis. The TF-\muSR experiments above (below) T = 2 K were performed using a standard ^{4}He gas-flow cryostat (^{3/4}He dilution cryostat) at beamline \piM3, both at the Paul-Scherrer-Institut in Villigen, Switzerland. _In situ_ pressed disc-shaped pellets of 10 mm diameter and about 2 mm thickness were sealed in especially designed sample holders made of high purity silver. The pellets were enclosed in dry helium gas behind a 100 \mum Mylar window to avoid exposure to water and oxygen. The samples were fixed with small amounts of dried silicon grease to guarantee thermal contact to the environment. After cooling the sample in an external field of B_{\rm ext}= 0.1 T to temperatures below T_{c} in order to induce a homogeneous flux line lattice (FLL), positive muons with initial spin polarization \vec{P}_{\mu}(t\!=\!0) transverse to the external field B_{\rm ext} were implanted. The muons come to rest at interstitial lattice sites which are yet unknown for the present compounds. However, since the characteristic length \lambda of the FLL is significantly larger than the lattice parameters, the implanted muons are randomly distributed throughout the FLL field profile. Each muon spin starts to precess in its local field with the Larmor frequency \omega_{\mu}\!=\!\gamma_{\mu}B_{\rm loc} ( \gamma_{\mu}\!=\!2\pi\!\cdot\!135.5 MHz/T). After an average lifetime of \tau = 2.2 \mus the muons decay emitting positrons preferably into the direction of the muon spin \vec{P}_{\mu}(t). The resulting asymmetric positron-emission rate N_{e^{+}}(t) includes all the information on the precession frequencies and depolarization rates of \vec{P}_{\mu}(t). The Fourier transform F(\omega_{\mu}) of N_{e^{+}}(t) yields the distribution of the precession frequencies of the muon spins and thus of the FLL field profiles. For polycrystalline samples typically almost symmetric Gaussian-shaped distributions F(\omega_{\mu}) are detected (see inset of Fig. 2) for which the second moments \langle\Delta\omega_{\mu}^{2}\rangle may be extracted by fitting the TF-\muSR time spectra P_{\mu}(t) by an exponential term \exp(-\sigma_{\rm eff}^{2}t^{2}/2) (for the definition of \sigma_{\rm eff} see Ref. 32) as is shown in Fig. 2. Here, the depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm eff} of the initial muon-spin polarization P_{\mu}(0) is proportional to the second moment of the frequency distribution \sigma_{\rm eff}\alpha\langle\Delta\omega_{\mu}^{2}\rangle. The magnetic penetration depth of a polycrystalline type-II superconductor can be evaluated from the depolarization rate:

\[\sigma_{\rm FLL}(T) (\mu s^{-1}) = \sqrt{\sigma_{\rm eff}^{2}(T)-\sigma_{\rm nuc}^{2}}\] (1) \[= 1.072\times 10^{5}\lambda_{\rm poly}^{-2}(T)\ \ ({\rm nm}),\]

wherein nuclear contributions \sigma_{\rm nuc} to the effective muon depolarization have been subtracted. [29] In order to check the reliability of the \lambda values obtained from the time spectra P_{\mu}(t) we additionally analyzed the Fourier transforms F_{\mu}(\omega). Figure 2 displays the time spectrum of a data set recorded with the {\rm Y}_{2}{\rm C}_{2}{\rm I}_{2} sample at T\!=\!3.0 K in an external field of B_{\rm ext}= 150 mT. The good agreement of Gaussians with the recorded time spectra is evidenced in the inset of Fig. 2.

In highly anisotropic superconductors, the flux lines are no longer in direction of the external field but are almost aligned parallel to the layers. Therefore, the second moment of the frequency distribution has a dominant contribution of the in-plane component of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\parallel}, and the equation

\[\lambda_{\rm poly}\!=\!1.23\times\lambda_{\parallel}\] (2)

was shown to hold for \gamma\!=\!\lambda_{\perp}/\lambda_{\parallel}\!\!>\!5, Ref. 31. The depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm FLL} of the initial spin polarization measured on polycrystalline samples of a highly anisotropic type-II superconductor provides therefore a direct measure of the in-plane penetration depth \lambda_{\parallel} and hence of the ratio of the superconducting condensate density n_{s} to the effective mass m_{\parallel}^{\rm g}

\[\sigma_{\rm FLL}[\mu s^{-1}] = 7.086\times 10^{4}\lambda_{\parallel}^{-2}\ \ ({\rm nm})\] (3) \[= 2.51\times 10^{-21}\frac{m_{e}}{m_{\parallel}^{\rm g}}n_{s}({ \rm cm}^{-3}).\]

It is known that a nearly symmetric and Gaussian line shape should be expected in polycrystalline samples due to random orientations of the grains of a superconductor with strongly anisotropic properties and the variation of the magnetization in the grains, [34] as it is in the present investigation (see Fig. 2). The influence of unusual flux states, pinning, and flux dynamics, however, cannot be directly gained (as they can in single-crystal materials), and these may induce systematic uncertainties in the second moments \langle\Delta\omega_{\mu}^{2}\rangle derived from \muSR data on polycrystalline samples. For example, the vortex-core radii and thus the field distributions of the vortices may be strongly field and temperature dependent as it is known for the layered superconductor NbSe_{2} (see  Ref. [35]). These systematic uncertainties have been the reason for objections to the interpretation of \muSR data on polycrystalline samples by means of a simple Gaussian analysis.[36] Therefore we emphasize that the quoted errors in \lambda(0) only relate to the statistical errors of the Gaussian analysis, and do not consider model-dependent uncertainties.

However, a systematic error in the second moment of the field distribution \langle\Delta B_{\rm loc}^{2}\rangle and \sigma_{\rm eff}\propto\langle\Delta\omega_{\rm sf}^{2}\rangle of 25% due to the influence of pinning effects or unusual flux states, would induce a variation of only 7% in the resulting penetration depth values.[29] Thus, despite all shortcomings mentioned above, there is reasonable consistency between the \sigma(0) and \lambda_{\parallel}(0) values that have been derived from TF-\muSR experiments on polycrystalline or single-crystalline samples of some cuprate superconductors.[29, 33, 37]

## IV Results and Discussion

In all investigated carbide superconductors we observed one distinct temperature dependent TF-\muSR depolarization rate which clearly proves the existence of a FLL over the total sample volume.

In the following, the experimental results of the TF-\muSR investigations are discussed. First, the field dependences of the depolarization rates \sigma_{\rm FLL} of YC_{2-\delta} and Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} recorded at T = 2.1 K are compared. From an analysis of \sigma(T = 2.1 K,B_{\rm ext}) data a field regime is found for which the London limit holds and the evaluation of \lambda is reliable. The subsequent measurements of the temperature dependences of the depolarization rates have been performed within these field ranges. The \lambda(T) data are compared to results of previous C_{P}(T,B) investigations which reveal a strong electron-phonon coupling in the Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} systems. From an extrapolation \sigma_{\rm FLL}(T \rightarrow 0), the superconducting charge carrier densities are obtained. These results are discussed in the scheme of the T_{c} vs \sigma_{\rm FLL}(0)-plot which reveals a linear relation of T_{c} and \sigma_{\rm FLL}(T \rightarrow 0)\propton_{s}/m_{\rm sf}^{\parallel} in the underdoped regime of the high-T_{c} cuprates and other exotic superconductors.[10]

### The field dependence of the depolarization rate

Equation (2) has been shown to be only meaningful if the external magnetic field B_{\rm ext} is within a range where the second moments of the field distribution \langle\Delta B_{\mu}^{2}\rangle\propto\langle\omega_{\rm sf}^{2}\rangle\propto\sigma_{\rm eff} are independent of the applied field B_{\rm ext}, Refs. [11] and [33]. The dependence of \sigma_{\rm eff} on B_{\rm ext} has been investigated in order to find a field range meeting the requirements of the London model. Figure 3 displays the field dependency \sigma_{\rm eff} for samples of the YC_{2-\delta} and Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} superconductors. Each data point has been obtained from a single time spectrum P_{\mu}(t) which was recorded after cooling the sample in the applied field from temperatures above T_{c} to 2.1 K. Both \sigma_{\rm eff}(T = 2.1 K,B_{\rm ext}) curves exhibit a cusp in the low-field range. For the Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} sample, \sigma_{\rm eff}(T = 2.1 K,B_{\rm ext}) increases until reaching a maximum value of 1.17\mus^{-1} at B_{\rm ext} \sim 30 mT. Above B_{\rm ext}\approx 80 mT the effective depolarization becomes independent of the applied field. The situation for the YC_{2-\delta} superconductor is more complicated because this compound is very close to the type-I type-II transition [38, 14] (\kappa_{\rm GL}\approx 1) where nonmagnetic impurities and defects quantitatively affect the magnetic phenomena in the superconducting state. In the dirty limit (l\ll \xi) the reduction of the normal-state mean free path l due to defects reduces the coherence length in the superconducting state \xi_{\rm eff}\propto\langle\overline{\xi}_{\rm clean}\cdot l and increases the critical field H_{\rm c2}\propto 1/l^{2}_{\rm eff}, Ref. [39]. The crystallographic characterization of our sample reveals a reduced c-lattice parameter (see Table 1) indicating a carbon deficiency. Also the reduced T_{c} and the higher critical field B_{\rm c2}(T = 2.1K) \approx 130 mT as compared to the results from the clean limit sample [14, 38] give further evidence for the investigated yttrium dicarbide sample to be in the dirty limit (Fig. 3). According to the \sigma_{\rm eff}(B_{\rm ext}) dependence, the applied field for the determination of the London penetration depth \lambda(0) for Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} must be larger than 80 mT, while for YC_{2-\delta} a reliable evaluation of \lambda(0) from Eq. (3) is not meaningful.

The low-field cusp in \sigma_{\rm eff}(B) was observed before for polycrystalline high-T_{c} superconductors.[29] The cusp was explained[40] as due to a pinning-induced distortion of the flux line lattice, which enhances \langle\Delta B_{\mu}^{2}\rangle and results in a higher value for the depolarization \sigma_{\rm eff}. The observation of such a cusp at low magnetic fields implies that pinning effects are weak and negligible at higher fields. This indicates the absence of strong pinning centers, e.g. lattice distortions or impurity phases, and evidences the high-quality and structural homogeneity of the investigated Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} sample.[29]

### The temperature dependence of the depolarization rate

In order to evaluate the London penetration depth from the TF-\muSR depolarization rates \sigma_{\rm eff}, the nuclear contributions \sigma_{\rm nuc} were subtracted according to Eq. (1). Above T_{c} , the internal field distribution is not affected by the FLL and a temperature-independent \muSR depolarization occurs due to the magnetic field induced by nuclear moments. For Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} and YC_{2-\delta} the temperature dependence of \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) is compared to the theoretical function of BCS theory

\[\frac{\sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)}{\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0)}=\frac{1}{1-\frac{\partial\ln \Delta(t)}{\partial\ln t}},\] (4)

Figure 3: Dependence of the depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm eff}(T = 2.1 K) on the applied magnetic field for Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} (circles) and YC_{2-\delta} (diamonds). The dashed lines were drawn to guide the eye. For Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} the depolarization is nearly constant for external fields above 80 mT. In the case of YC_{2-\delta} no field regime satisfies the requirements of the London limit. The critical field B_{\rm c2}\approx 130 mT of the investigated YC_{2-\delta} sample is higher than that of a clean-limit sample (see text).

  where \Delta(t) is the temperature dependence of the BCS-gap width [41] and t = T/T_{c}. Additionally, a power law

\[\frac{\sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)}{\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0)} = 1 - t^{n}\]

has also been fitted to the data, where n = 4 corresponds to the two-fluid (2FL) model. [42]

The \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) data are in qualitative agreement with the investigations of the specific-heat jump at T_{c}. In the case of YC_{2 - \delta}, the data pass along the theoretical curve of the BCS model for weak electron-phonon coupling, and are fitted by a power law with a power of n = 2.5. However, we note that there is no applied magnetic field to hold the London limit for YC_{2 - \delta} [and thus there is no simple relation between \sigma_{\rm FLL} and the London penetration depth as in Eq. (1)]. Nevertheless, the observed \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) data are in fair agreement with BCS theory assuming a \sigma_{\rm FLL}\propto 1/\lambda_{\rm poly}^{2} relation (see Fig. 4).

For Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2}, the power-law fit results in an exponent of n = 3.1, which is significantly enhanced with respect to that of YC_{2 - \delta}. Here, \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) data have larger values than according to BCS theory and are shifted in the direction of the 2FL model. The large value of the exponent n = 3.1 qualitatively indicates an enhanced electron-phonon coupling in Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2}. The analysis of \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) supports the the heat-capacity data for both samples: According to the analysis of the specific-heat jump at T_{c} using the \alpha model, [43] the gap width of YC_{2} amounts to a value of \alpha = \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 1.82, which is close to the BCS value of \alpha = 1.79 and indicates weak electron-phonon coupling for this compound. [17] On the other hand, a significantly increased gap width of \alpha = \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = 2.27 has been reported for Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2}, which implies strong electron-phonon coupling. In the context with the above results it should be mentioned that there is a marked disagreement of the \sigma_{\rm FLL}(t)/\sigma_{\rm FLL}(0) dependence between polycrystalline samples and single crystals of high-T_{c} cuprates, which has not yet been understood. [29; 44] The above results support s-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in all investigated compounds. Final conclusive evidence on the nature of the order parameter, however, can only be gained from investigations on single crystals.

### The London penetration depth

The London penetration depths \lambda(0) of the Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} compounds have been evaluated in the scope of London theory by extrapolating the low-temperature TF-\muSR depolarization \sigma_{\rm FLL}(T \to 0). The values of the London penetration depths, which were taken from polycrystalline samples have been deduced according to Eq. (1) and are compiled in Table 2. In the case of YC_{2 - \delta}, the evaluation of the magnetic penetration depth is not meaningful because there is no field range where the London limit applies (see Chap. IV A). The \lambda(0) values gained from the present \muSR experiments are in excellent agreement with those which were reported from an analysis of the magnetization data for the same Y_{2}C_{2}X_{2} compounds. [17] However, the accuracy of the present \lambda(0) values is about one order of magnitude higher (the estimated error about one order of magnitude lower) as for the magnetization measurements reported in Ref. [17].

Investigations of the upper critical field of a Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} crystal yield an anisotropy ratio of \gamma = \xi_{\parallel}/\xi_{\perp} = 5.2 \div 0.2. This value is similar to that reported for fully oxygenated (slightly overdoped) YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7 - x}, Ref. [45], and Eq. (2) may be used in the case of Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} in order to obtain the in-plane component of the London penetration depths \lambda_{\parallel} = 257\pm 3 nm. With \gamma = 5.2, the out-of-plane value of the penetration depth of Y_{2}C_{2}I_{2} amounts to \lambda_{\perp} = 1340 \pm 50 nm.

### The superconducting charge carrier density

The shielding currents of a superconductor penetrate in the length scale of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda(0) which is directly related to the superconducting condensate density n_{s}(0)/m* for clean limit superconductors [see Eq. (3)]. Uemura _et al._ were the first to realize that the transition temperatures of the underdoped cuprates when plotted versus the TF-\muSR depolarization rate \sigma_{\rm FLL}(T \to 0)\propto n_{s}(0)/m* fall on a common line. [10] An explanation for this amazing finding was proposed by Emery _et al._[8] who suggested that phase fluctuations of the order parameter in the superconducting state become increasingly pronounced with decreasing con
