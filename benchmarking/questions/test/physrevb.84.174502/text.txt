###### Abstract

We report tunnel-diode resonator (TDR) measurements of in-plane London penetration depth, \(\lambda(T)\), in optimally-doped single crystals of FeTe\({}_{0.58}\)Se\({}_{0.42}\) with \(T_{c}\sim 14.8\) K. To avoid any size-dependent calibration effect, six samples of different sizes and deliberately introduced surface roughness were measured and compared. The power-law behavior, \(\Delta\lambda(T)=AT^{*}\), was found for all samples with the average exponent \(n_{avg}=2.3\pm 0.1\) and the prefactor \(A_{avg}=1.0\pm 0.2\) nm/K\({}^{2.3}\). The average superfluid density is well described by the self-consistent two-gap \(\gamma\) model resulting in \(\Delta_{t}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=1.93\) and \(\Delta_{t^{\prime}}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=0.9\). These results suggest the nodeless two-gap pairing symmetry with strong pair breaking effects. In addition, it is found from comparison among six different samples that, while the exponent \(n\) remains virtually unchanged, the prefactor \(A\) shows some variation, but stays within a reasonable margin, ruling out some recent suggestions that surface conditions can significantly affect the results. This indicates that the calibration procedure used to obtain \(\lambda(T)\) from the measured TDR frequency shift is robust and that the uncertainty in sample dimensions and the nature of surface roughness play only a minor role.

## I Introduction

The iron chalcogenide family of superconductors Fe\(Ch\) (\(Ch=\) Se/Te/S) was discovered in 2008[1] shortly after the discovery of iron-arsenide superconductor LaO\({}_{1-x}\)F\({}_{x}\)FeAs.[2] The structure of this family is simpler than those of other Fe-based superconductors (FeSC).[3, 4, 5, 6] The square planar sheets of Fe ions are alternated by the distorted tetrahedra of chalcogen ions. Even with simpler structure, the electronic structure of Fe\(Ch\) is similar to other FeSCs. Superconductivity in Fe\(Ch\) appears upon substitution of Te with Se or S[7, 8] and strongly depends on the amount of excess Fe.[19] In Fe\({}_{y}\)Te\({}_{1-x}\)Se\({}_{x}\) at optimal doping, the superconducting transition temperature, \(T_{c}\), reaches \(\sim\)14 K at atmospheric pressure and increases up to \(\sim\)36 K under pressure.[10, 11, 12, 13, 14] A series of theoretical and experimental studies suggest that superconductivity in Fe\(Ch\) could be magnetically mediated.[15, 16, 17, 18]

The pairing mechanism of Fe\(Ch\) has been studied by different techniques.[19, 20] In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of polycrystalline FeSe (\(T_{c}=8\) K), the unconventional pairing was suggested from the absence of the coherence peak in conjunction with the power-law temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate, \(1/T_{1}\sim T^{3.19}\) This can be explained with the unconventional order parameter, such as a fully gapped \(s_{\pm}\) or a gap with nodes. In thermal conductivity measurements on FeSe\({}_{x}\) single crystals, the multigap nodeless superconductivity was suggested.[20]

The London penetration depth in Fe\(Ch\) has been measured by using different methods.[21, 22, 23, 24, 25] Muon spin rotation (\(\mu\)SR) measurements in FeSe\({}_{x}\) are consistent with either anisotropic \(s\)-wave or a two-gap extended \(s\)-wave pairing.[21] Microwave cavity perturbation technique determined both real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance and, in addition to \(\lambda(T)\), could also estimate temperature-dependent scattering time from which a crossover from a dirty to a clean limit upon cooling has been proposed.[24] Radio-frequency tunnel-diode resonator (TDR) measurements of \(\lambda_{ab}(T)\) in Fe\({}_{y}\)Te\({}_{1-x}\)Se\({}_{x}\)[\(x=0.37\) (Ref. [22]], \(x=0.44\) (Ref. [23]), and \(x=0.45\) (Ref. [25]) by three different groups found similar power-law exponent \(n\) and some variation in the prefactor \(A\): \(n\sim 2.0\), \(A\sim 3.7\) nm/K\({}^{n}\) (Ref. [22]), \(n\sim 2.2\), \(A\sim 0.9\) nm/K\({}^{n}\) (Ref. [23]), and \(n\sim 2.0\), \(A\sim 4\) nm/K\({}^{n}\) (Ref. [25]). However, an attempt to compare the TDR results with \(\lambda(T)\) estimated from the first critical field, \(H_{c1}\), using the Ginzburg-Landau formula (valid only at \(T_{c}\)) resulted in a large discrepancy forcing the authors of Ref. [25] to suggest that the calculated effective dimension, \(R\),[26] should be five times smaller in order to fit the \(H_{c1}\) data (\(R=2.8\)\(\mu\)m vs \(R=14\)\(\mu\)m).[25] (Note that in Ref. [25] a five times larger value, \(R=70\)\(\mu\)m, is indicated.) Such a large discrepancy was attributed to the surface roughness, so that the volume penetrated by the magnetic field is much greater when the surface is rougher compared to the case of a perfectly flat surface. The authors, however, made no attempt to verify this hypothesis.

In this paper, we study the effects of sample size, shape, and surface roughness on the measurements of the London penetration depth in optimally doped FeTe\({}_{0.58}\)Se\({}_{0.42}\) with \(T_{c}\sim 14.8\) K using a TDR technique. A series of measurements were carried out on parts of the same samples. To check the effect of surface roughness on \(\lambda(T)\), the edges of one of the samples were deliberately damaged by a blade; see Fig. 1. Measurements of the samples before and after damaging the edges showed no significant change of the prefactor \(A\) or the exponent \(n\). In all samples, we find robust power-law variation, \(\lambda(T)\sim AT^{n}\) with \(n=2.3\pm 0.1\) indicating an intrinsic behavior. Furthermore, the corresponding superfluid density ([\(\lambda(0)/\lambda(T)\)]\({}^{2}\)) was well fitted by the self-consistent two-gap \(\gamma\) model. These results, the exponent \(n=2.3\) and the corresponding two-gap fit, suggest the nodeless two-gap pairing symmetry with strong pair breaking effect.

## II Experiment

Single crystals of FeTe\({}_{0.58}\)Se\({}_{0.42}\) were synthesized using a flux method as reported before.[11] The samples studied in this work had a composition of \(\mathrm{Fe:Te:Se=1.00\pm 0.01:0.58\pm 0.01:0.42\pm 0.01}\) determined from the energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). Several samples were studied and all showed consistent results. Some broke during the roughening process, so here we present samples with the most complete sets of data. Initially two samples 1 and 2 were prepared by careful cleaving and cutting processes. Then sample 1 was split into samples 1-A and 1-B. To investigate the influence of the edge roughness, deliberate damage was done to sample 2 by a razor blade. The original (sample 2) and roughened ones (sample 2-R) are shown in Fig. 1. To produce heaviest roughness possible, the damaging process was repeated multiple times resulting in a loss of about 10% of volume. After the measurements, the rough surface of Sample 2-R was cut again as clean as possible to remove the roughness and the cleaned one was labeled as 2-R-C. The penetration depth was measured at each stage of the described procedures. The dimensions and edge condition of samples are summarized in Table 1.

The in-plane London penetration depth, \(\lambda(T)\), was measured using a self-oscillating tunnel-diode resonator (TDR) technique.[26, 27, 28] A sample under study is mounted on a sapphire rod and inserted into an inductor coil of a inductance (L) capacitance (C) tank circuit. To measure the in-plane penetration depth, the sample is placed with its \(c\) axis along the direction of an ac field (\(H_{\mathrm{ac}}\)) induced by the inductor coil. Since \(H_{\mathrm{ac}}\sim 20\) mOe is weak enough (\(\ll\)\(H_{\mathrm{c1}}\)), the sample is in the Meissner state, so its magnetic response is determined by the London penetration depth. The frequency shift in TDR, \(\Delta f\equiv f(T)-f_{0}\), is used to obtain the magnetic susceptibility \(\chi(T)\) from \(\Delta f=-G4\pi\chi(T)\). Here \(f_{0}=1/2\pi\sqrt{\mathrm{LC}}\sim 14\) MHz is the resonant frequency of an empty resonator, \(G=f_{0}V_{s}/2V_{c}(1-N)\) is a geometric factor defined by the coil and sample volumes, \(V_{c}\) and \(V_{s}\), and \(N\) is the demagnetization factor. Calibration constant \(G\) is directly measured by pulling the sample out of the coil at the lowest temperature. In the Meissner state, \(\lambda\) can be obtained from the magnetic susceptibility, \(\chi\), following the relation \(4\pi\chi=(\lambda/R)\mathrm{tanh}(R/\lambda)-1\), where \(R\) is the effective dimension of the sample.[28]

## III Results and discussion

Figure 2 shows the raw data, temperature-dependent frequency shift, \(\Delta f(T)\), for samples listed in Table 1. It is obvious that all the samples have quite sharp and well overlapping transition curves with the width of the superconducting transition of \(\sim\)0.3 K, so it seems that intrinsic superconducting properties were consistently reproducible between the samples (all samples come from the same large piece).

Above \(T_{c}\), the signal, \(\Delta f(T)\), saturates due to two possible reasons. One, the so-called sample-size-limited regime, is due to the size of a sample, which affects the \(\mathrm{tanh}\)\(R/\lambda\) factor in the expression for the differential susceptibility. Another reason for the saturation, so-called skin-depth limited, occurs if the penetration depth becomes limited by the normal state skin depth. At \(T_{c}\), the estimated value of the skin depth is about twice that estimated from our calibration for \(\lambda(T)\).[29] Thus the samples under current study are in sample-size-limited regime, so their penetration depth shifts, \(\Delta\lambda(T)\), are calculated from \(\Delta f(T)\) in Fig. 3 following the calibration procedure explained above. Figure 3(a) shows the full temperature range, which reveals sharp phase transitions at 14.8 K. The low temperature behavior of \(\Delta\lambda\) is shown in Fig. 3(b). From these calibrated values, we see that the penetration length in the normal state is comparable to the values of \(R\), so we are in a sample-size-limited regime. Therefore, the total frequency shift between the lowest temperature (\(\sim\)500 mK) and the normal state temperature (\(T>T_{c}\)), \(\Delta f_{\mathrm{total}}\), is related to the sample dimension. For instance, the largest sample 1 has the biggest \(\Delta f_{\mathrm{total}}\) and the smallest sample 1-A has the smallest \(\Delta f_{\mathrm{total}}\). The inset in Fig. 2 shows \(\Delta f(T)\) normalized by the value at 16 K.

  For quantitative analysis of the low temperature behavior, a power-law fit, \(\Delta\lambda(T)=AT^{n}\) was performed for all six samples. To check how robust is the power law, in each case, four different upper temperature limits for the fit were used: \(T_{c}/3\), \(T_{c}/4\), \(T_{c}/5\), and \(T_{c}/6\), shown schematically by arrows in Fig. 3(b). The results of the fitting are summarized in Fig. 4. Clearly, the fit coefficients remain fairly constant with small (and expected) deviations at the lowest and the highest limits. Below, we discuss the results for \(T_{c}/4\) chosen as the upper limit for the fit.

As shown in Fig. 4(a), in general, the exponent \(n\) is rather steady among all cases even though there are small variations. From the best fits with \(T/T_{c}\) upper limit, the average exponent \(n_{avg}=2.3\pm 0.1\) is quite comparable to the previous reports of \(n=2.1\) (Ref. [22]), \(2.2\) (Ref. [23]), and \(2.0\) (Ref. [25]). In conjunction with the superfluid density analysis discussed later, the exponent \(n=2.3\) can be explained by the nodeless two-gap pairing symmetry with strong pair breaking effect. The behavior of the prefactor \(A\) is summarized in Fig. 4(b). Clearly, there is a very weak dependence on the fitting range, but there is a more substantial change between the samples. The average over all samples prefactor \(A_{avg}=1.0\pm 0.2\) nm/K\({}^{2.3}\) is similar to other reports.[22; 23]

The prefactor \(A\) is a parameter that is linked to the overall behavior of superfluid density. Since there is a claim that surface roughness can affect calibration factor \(R\), ultimately influencing \(A\), we will briefly discuss the observed variation of \(A\) among different samples. For the purpose of consistency, we will only compare the values obtained from the fitting range up to \(T_{c}/4\), where the fit quality was the best for all samples. We started by measuring sample 1 that showed \(A=0.9\) nm/K\({}^{2.3}\). After then, sample 1 was cut into samples 1-A and 1-B. Every attempt was made to cut as clean as possible, but the prefactor \(A\) has increased for both samples 1-A and 1-B to 1.3 nm/K\({}^{2.3}\). Although this change is not too significant, this result suggests that the effect of the rough edges becomes more pronounced as the sample size decreases. To estimate the effect of roughness itself when the size of a sample remains the same, sample 2-R was made out of sample 2 by deliberately damaging the edge with a razor blade. However, it turns out that the increment in \(A\) was only \(0.4\) nm/K\({}^{2.3}\) from \(0.7\) nm/K\({}^{2.3}\) for sample 2, increasing to \(1.1\) nm/K\({}^{2.3}\) for sample 2-R. This increment is similar to that between sample 1 and two samples 1-A and 1-B. This means that the intentional roughness created by coarse roughening a sample does not significantly affect the result and it also means that the effective sample dimension \(R\) used to calibrate the TDR data (so that it directly affects the prefactor \(A\)) is very close to the calculated value. Otherwise, coarse roughening would make it many times larger due to the increased surface area exposed to the field. Furthermore, we tried to remove the rough surface from sample 2-R by cutting the edges as clean as possible. The cleaned sample

Panel (a): the exponent \(n\), obtained by keeping \(A\) and \(n\) as free parameters. Panel (b): the prefactor \(A\), obtained at a fixed \(n_{avg}=2.3\), which is the average among all six samples shown in panel (a).

The arrows indicate the upper limits of fitting. The dashed lines are representative fits for each sample conducted up to \(T_{c}/3\). All the fitting results are summarized in Fig. 4.

  2-R-C showed that \(l\) has decreased by 0.1 nm/T2.3 from that of sample 2-R. This reenforces our conclusion that surface roughness is not a dominant source determining \(A\) and plays only a minor role. There is no way it could cause the factor of 5 difference claimed in Ref. [25]. Finally, we conclude that global measurements provide a reliable estimate of the overall behavior of the London penetration depth by sampling all sample surfaces in contrast to the local probes that are affected by the surface topography at the mesoscopic scale.

The superfluid densities \(\rho_{s}=[\lambda(0)/\lambda(T)]^{2}\) for all samples are shown in Fig. 5. The absolute penetration depth, _l_(0) = 560 nm, was determined by TDR measurements of an Al-coated sample.22 The variation of \(\rho_{s}\) among different samples is shown in Fig. 5(a). For the purpose of fitting, the average \(\rho_{s}^{\text{avg}}\) is calculated from \(\rho_{s}\) of samples 1 and 2, which have the lowest \(A\) values. The fitting was done with a self-consistent clean two-gap \(\gamma\) model, where two gaps are calculated self-consistently at each temperature and at each iteration.30,31 The full iterative routine for multiple gaps with scattering is not yet available.31 Since temperature diminishes the relative contribution of impurity scattering, we expect to have better agreement at the higher temperatures and deviations from exponential behavior at the low temperatures. Yet, we believe that the extracted coupling parameters are meaningful. The total superfluid density is given by \(\rho=\gamma\rho_{s}+(1-\gamma)\rho_{s}\). The partial densities of states are chosen to be equal on the two bands, \(n_{1}=n_{2}=0.5\) and Debye temperature of 230 K was used to calculate the experimentally observed \(T_{c}=14.8\) K, which fixes the coupling constants (we used \(l\)11). Figure 5(b) demonstrates a good agreement between experimental \(\rho_{s}^{\text{avg}}\) (symbols) and fitting (black solid line). The parameters acquired from the fit are \(l\)11 = 0.66, \(l\)22 = 0.44, \(l\)12 = 0.07, _l_eff = 0.34, \(g\) = 0.75, and _T_c = 14.95 K. This result indicates that a 75% contribution of superfluid density comes from the band with \(\rho_{s}\), which has the larger gap \(\Delta_{s}\). We have also attempted to fit the data only in the intermediate temperature range, where the effect of impurities is relatively smaller and we found fitting parameters similar to those reported above. Since our model does not include details of the Fermi surface shape, Fermi velocities, and the densities of states, this is the best accuracy that we can achieve using this approach.

The inset in Fig. 5(b) shows the behaviors of two energy gaps \(\Delta_{s}\) and \(\Delta_{s}\) versus temperature. Clearly, the smaller gap has significantly non-BCS temperature dependence. The zero temperature values of the energy gaps \(\Delta_{s}(0)\) and \(\Delta_{s}(0)\) are 2.5 meV [\(\Delta_{s}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=1.93\)] and 1.1 meV [\(\Delta_{s}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=0.9\)], respectively. From the previous measurements, such as _m_SR [32, 33] and penetration depth,22 two isotropic gaps were reported with gap values similar to our results. _m_SR studies in FeSe0.5Te0.5 (Refs. [32] and [33]) revealed two gaps of \(\Delta_{\text{large}}\sim 2.6\) meV and \(\Delta_{\text{small}}\sim 0.5\)-0.87 meV, and the penetration depth study22 also showed that \(\Delta_{\text{large}}\sim 2.1\) meV and \(\Delta_{s}\sim 1.2\) meV. According to the scanning tunneling spectroscopy study, only one _s_-wave gap \(\Delta\sim 2.3\) meV was observed in FeSe0.4Te0.6 [84], which is similar to the large gap \(\Delta_{I}(0)\) of our result. However, rather large single or multigaps were reported from specific heat,35 optical conductivity,36 point-contact Andreev reflectivity,37 and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy,38 suggesting strong-coupling superconductivity. The electronic specific heat in FeTe0.57Se0.43 [35] revealed two energy gaps with \(\Delta_{\text{large}}\sim 7.4\) meV and \(\Delta_{\text{small}}\sim 5.0\) meV. From the optical conductivity in FeTe0.55Se0.43, two large energy gaps were also found with \(\Delta_{\text{large}}\sim 5.1\) meV and \(\Delta_{\text{small}}\sim 2.5\) meV. The point-contact Andreev reflectivity in FeTe0.55Se0.45 is consistent with single gap _s_-wave symmetry with \(\Delta\) (at 1.70 K) \(\sim\)3.8 meV. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in FeTe0.7Se0.3 [38], an _s_-wave single gap of \(\Delta\sim 4\) meV was also observed. Overall, the pairing symmetry in FeTe1-xSe1 is still under debate, but our results strongly suggest a two-gap scenario with significant pair-breaking scattering.

## IV Conclusions

To summarize, London penetration depth, _l_(_T_), was measured in single crystals of optimally-doped FeTe0.58Se0.42 on samples of different size, shape, and surface roughness. All samples were parts of the same original crystal, which allowed us to separate extrinsic and intrinsic effects. Even though there

(b) The average superfluid density for all six samples, \(\rho_{s}^{\text{avg}}\) (red circle), is fitted to the two-gap \(\gamma\) model.30 Black solid line is the fitting result with \(\rho=\gamma\rho_{s}+(1-\gamma)\rho_{s}\). The inset shows two gaps acquired from the fit, \(\Delta_{s}\) and \(\Delta_{s}\).

  is a natural dispersion among six different samples, the average exponent \(n_{\rm avg}\) and prefactor \(A_{\rm avg}\) are found to be \(2.3\pm 0.1\) and \(1.0\pm 0.1\) nm/K\({}^{2.3}\). In addition, the superfluid density is well fitted to the two-gap \(\gamma\) model with \(\Delta_{s}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=1.93\) and \(\Delta_{s,t}(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=0.9\). These results suggest the nodeless two-gap pairing symmetry with strong pair breaking effect. In addition, the analysis of the data on six samples suggests that although some micro-(meso-) scopic surface roughness always exists, it only affects the prefactor \(A\) and becomes progressively more important as the sample size decreases. We conclude that the global TDR measurements provide an accurate and objective way to determine London penetration depth in pnictide superconductors.
