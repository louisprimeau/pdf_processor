###### Abstract

Superconducting Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5 is rare because optimal superconducting transition temperature is achieved without chemical doping or pressure. However, the unclear crystal structure limits our ability to understand the structure-property relationship. Using atomically resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction, we directly determine the structure of this superconductor: it forms a monoclinic structure (space group \(P2_{1}/n\)) with lattice parameters \(a=b=8.76\,\text{\AA}\), \(c=20.18\,\text{\AA}\), and \(\gamma=90.5^{\circ}\). Compared with previously reported structures derived from diffraction experiments, the \(c\)-lattice constant is doubled due to alternating stacking of Pt4As8 layers, which induces a high density of stacking faults. With the establishment of the crystal structure, stacking faults, and chemical composition, the distinctive normal-state electrical and thermal transport properties of our superconducting Ca10Pt4As8((Fe1-7Pt4)2As2)5 (\(\kappa\sim 0.05\)) single crystals can be explained.

The discovery of high-temperature (\(T_{\text{c}}\)) superconductivity in Fe-based compounds has generated tremendous interest in the condensed-matter and materials science community [1]. This class of materials offers opportunity not only for studying new superconducting mechanisms but also for exploring structure-property relationships and chemical doping effects [1]. As in high-\(T_{\text{c}}\) cuprates, Fe-pnictide superconductors form a layered structure, consisting of the FeAs building block, separated by interlayer spacers. Superconductivity can be induced by chemical doping, and the resultant phase diagrams are similar for both Fe- and Cu-based superconductors, i.e., superconductivity emerges after suppressing magnetism with increasing chemical doping [2,3]. One of few exceptions is Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5, which exhibits optimal \(T_{\text{c}}\) without chemical doping [4]. Structurally, the spacer Ca10Pt4As8, between two adjacent FeAs layers, consists of an intermediary Pt4As8 layer, with the skutterudite structure, sandwiched by two Cu layers [4, 5, 6, 7]. Unlike perovskite- or rocksalt-type blocking layers such as Sr4\({}_{M}\)2O6 (\(M\) = Sc, Cr, V) [8, 9, 10, 11], the Pt4As8 layer in Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5 is negatively charged [4, 6, 7]. This means that the Pt4As8 layer competes with neighboring negatively charged FeAs layer for electrons provided by Ca. As a result, atomic displacement and stoichiometry in Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5 is critical to both superconductivity and the normal-state physical properties [12,13]. Evidence is accumulating that subtle changes in either Ca or Pt distribution [12,14] or FeAs4 tetrahedral distortion [13,14] would negatively impact superconductivity in Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5. For example, Pt vacancies in Ca10Pt3As8(Fe2As2)5 lead to the absence of superconductivity [5, 6, 7].

Complicating the interpretation is the fact that Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5 can form multiple structures. To date, three space groups, \(P4/n\) (tetragonal) [6, 7], \(P2_{1}/n\) (monoclinic) [15], and \(P_{-1}\) (triclinic) [4, 5, 7], have been reported for this compound using single-crystal x-ray-diffraction refinement and are listed in Table 1. At present, the role of crystal structure on physical properties, particularly on \(T_{\text{c}}\), is unknown. While superconductivity is observed in both tetragonal and triclinic structures [4, 5, 6, 7], physical properties of monoclinic Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5 have not been investigated. Here, we report the crystal structure (monoclinic) and the effect of Pt doping of superconducting Ca10Pt4As8((Fe1-7Pt4)2As2)5 determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron diffraction. We demonstrate that atomically resolved STEM is an essential compliment to either x-ray or neutron diffraction. With the direct observation of the crystal structure, stacking faults, and Pt doping, the unusual electrical and thermal transport properties of Ca10Pt4As8((Fe1-7Pt4)2As2)5 can be explained. The structure-property relationship in this system is further discussed.

For the growth of Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5 single crystals, stoichiometric amounts of high-purity calcium shot (99.999% Alfa Aesar), platinum powder (99.95% Alfa Aesar), iron powder (99.95% Alfa Aesar), and arsenic powder (99.999% Alfa Aesar) are mixed in a ratio of 10:4:10:18 as reported previously [7]. The mixture is placed in an alumina crucible and sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum. The whole assembly is heated in a box furnace to 700 degC at a rate of 150 degC/h, and is held at this temperature for 5 h. It is then heated to 1100 degC at a rate of 80 degC/h. After holding at 1100 degC for 50 h, it is cooled to 1050 degC at a rate of 1.25 degC/h. It is then cooled to 500 degC at a rate of 5.5 degC/h, and finally cooled down to room temperature by turning off power. Shiny platelike single crystals with typical dimensions of 4x4x0.2 mm3 were obtained without any additional processing.

The chemical composition of resultant crystals was determined by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in a FEI Quanta 200 scanning microscope, and by simulating STEM intensities. Cross-sectional TEM samples were  prepared using focused ion beam with Ga+ ions, and were further milled using Nanomill instrument with Ar+ ions to remove surface damage. All TEM experiments were performed on the 200-keV JEOL ARM electron microscope equipped with two aberration correctors and a cold field-emission source. The atomically resolved structure of crystals was obtained in high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM imaging mode. The simulated diffraction patterns were calculated based on the Bloch wave method. The simulation of HAADF-STEM images is based on the multislice method. The HAADF detector was set with 67 and 275 mrad as inner and outer collection angles, respectively. Thermal motion is considered in the calculations by adding random displacements to atoms from their sites using the Gaussian function with their corresponding Debye-Waller factors. The channeling effect of the incident electron beam propagating along atomic columns was also included. Sample thicknesses used in our simulation range from 20 to 50 nm with a step of 10 nm.

Magnetic susceptibility measurement was carried out in a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System. Electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements were performed in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System using the standard four-probe technique. Magnetoresistivity (MR) at a constant temperature was measured by sweeping magnetic field between -14 and +14 T, and calculated using MRab = [(_r_ab(+_H_) + _r_ab(-_H_)]/2 - _r_ab(0)]]/_r_ab(0).

Different crystal structures of Ca10PtAs8((Fe1-_r_Pt)2 As2)5 can be distinguished by the morphology [7]: platelike crystals possess tetragonal structure while needlelike crystals are triclinic. In both the tetragonal and triclinic cases, the lattice parameters \(a\) and \(b\) are similar (Table 1), but the relative positions of consecutive Pt4As8 layers are different as discussed later. For our platelike crystals [see the inset of Fig. 1(f)], we conducted atomically resolved HAADF-STEM imaging and electron diffraction to determine the structure. The structure is monoclinic \(P\)21/_n_ (#13) with the lattice constants of \(a = b = 8.76\) A, \(c = 20.18\) A, and \(\gamma \sim 90.5^{\circ}\). As illustrated in Figs. 1(a)-1(d), the _c_-axis lattice parameter is nearly doubled compared to the reported results for the tetragonal and triclinic structures (see Table 1) [4-7]. The unit cell consists of two (Fe2As2)5 and two Ca10PtAs8 layers, with stacking sequence of Pt4As8-Ca-Fe2As2-Ca-Pt4As8-CaFe2As2-Ca-Pt4As8 layers, as can be seen in HAADF-STEM images in Figs. 1(b)-1(d). Note that the Pt4As8 layer is very thin compared to the Fe2As2 layer. HAADF-STEM images are sensitive to heavy elements, where the intensity is proportional to the square of atomic number \(Z^{2}\)[16]. The brightest spots correspond to Pt and the dimmest ones correspond to Ca ions, with the Fe2As2 layer located between the Ca planes. The HAADF-STEM image of Fig. 1(b) is obtained along the [120] (identical to [210]) direction, where the Fe and As atomic columns in the Fe2As2 layer can be clearly separated. The Fe2As2 layers are congruently stacked as can be seen in Fig. 1(b). The intensity profile in Fig. 1(b) shows a higher intensity of the Fe column than that of the As column in the Fe2As2 layer, which is unexpected because the atomic number of As (\(Z=33\)) is larger than that of Fe (\(Z=26\)). Such behavior can be attributed to the existence of Pt with \(Z=78\), partially occupying the Fe site in the Fe2As2 layer. On the right-hand side of Fig. 1(b), we plot the intensity along the yellow line in the HAADF-STEM image (on the left-hand side), and the simulated result (red line). Comparison of experimental and simulated HAADF-STEM images allows us to estimate that Pt doping level to be \(x\sim 0.05\pm 0.02\). This gives the chemical composition of Ca10Pt4AsFe9.5As18, consistent with EDX measurements.

Since there is no information about superconductivity in monoclinic Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5, would it still be superconducting? Figure 1(e) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility under both the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) conditions with the applied field of 20 Oe. Note that the system becomes diamagnetic below \(T_{\text{c}}=32\) K. At the same temperature, both the in-plane (_r_ab) and _c_-axis (\(\rho_{\text{c}}\)) resistivities also drop to zero as shown in Fig. 1(f). The data in Figs. 1(e) and 1(f) indicate that our single crystals are superconducting below 32 K. According to the phase diagram of \(T_{\text{c}}\) versus \(x\) for the tetragonal Ca10Pt4As8((Fe1-_r_Pt)2As2)5 in Ref. [4], \(T_{\text{c}}=32\) K corresponds to \(x\sim 0.02\), much lower than that estimated via EDX and STEM of 0.05 in our monoclinic sample. We also notice similar trend occurs for the triclinic Ca10Pt4As8((Fe1-_r_Pt0.13)2As2)5 (with \(x\sim 0.13\)) in which \(T_{\text{c}}\sim 13\) K [7] would correspond to \(x\sim 0.08\) of Pt doping in the \(T_{\text{c}}\) versus \(x\) diagram for the tetragonal structure [4]. These strongly suggest that superconductivity in both monoclinic

Detailed features of the monoclinic structure of Ca10Pt4As8(Fe1.9Pt0.1As2)5 are illustrated in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) shows the structure in the _ac_ plane, with the dashed blue square marking the middle Pt4As8 layer and adjacent Ca layers. Pt1 is in the plane and Pt2 are out of the plane (up and down). There is an obvious shift between the top and bottom Pt4As8 layers. For comparison, we depict the Pt4As8 layer in Fig. 2(b): it consists of distorted PtAs4 squares with corner-sharing As, which form As-As dimers as marked by dashed blue episodes. The unit cell of the PtAs4 layer is indicated by the black square, which is larger than that of the Fe2As2 lattice marked by the light blue square in the bottom part of Fig. 2(b), with the side length \(a_{0}=3.4\) A. The relationship between the two unit cells is \(a=b=\sqrt{5}a_{0}\). In each Pt4As8 layer, half of the Pt4As4 squares have Pt (Pt1, yellow color) atoms in the middle of the As4 square. The other half Pt (Pt2, light and dark green colors) atoms are out of the plane, due to the adjacent Ca layer. Thus, the Pt2 atoms can be above (dark green) and below (light green) the Pt1 plane. The adjacent Ca atoms also shift to accommodate Pt2 atoms. Since Pt2 atoms are closer to As atoms in the adjacent Fe2As2 layer, the distortion of the Pt4As8 layer leads to the change of As-Fe-As bonding in the Fe2As2 layer. X-ray-absorption fine-structure measurements indicate that stoichiometric Ca10Pt4As8(Fe2As2)5 consists of regular (nondistorted) FeAs4 tetrahedron [13]. Such atomic arrangement may provide the optimal As-Fe-As angle (\(\sim\)109.5\({}^{\circ}\)) for superconductivity [13; 14; 17; 18; 19].

Figure 2(c) illustrates possible relative positions between adjacent Pt4As8 layers. The Pt1 square lattice in one layer (solid red square) does not overlay with the lattice of the nearest Pt4As8 layer (dashed black square). The monoclinic structure of Ca10Pt4As8((Fe1-2Pt4)2As2)5 can be constructed from the tetragonal structure with the space group \(P4/n\)[4; 6; 7]: creating a supercell doubled along the \(c\) axis, and then sliding the middle Pt4As8 layer and adjacent Ca layers with a shift vector \(q_{\text{B}}=(1/5,\ -2/5,\ 0)\) (variant B). Due to such shift, the symmetry of the system becomes monoclinic \(P2_{1}/n\) with \(\beta=90.5^{\circ}\). To further confirm this, we collected selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns from three main directions. Figure 3 shows both experimental [Figs. 3(a)-3(c)] and simulated [Figs. 3(d)-3(f)] SAED patterns, collected with a selected area aperture of 10 \(\mu\)m, along the \([001],\ [210],\ [010]\) zone-axis directions, respectively. The consistency of the experimental and simulated diffraction patterns verifies the monoclinic structure.

As shown in Fig. 3, strong diffraction spots (indexed in yellow color) are associated with the basic tetragonal structure dictated by the Fe2As2 layer, while weak satellite reflections (indexed in blue color) mainly result from the distorted Pt4As8 structure. Compared with the simulated patterns, the satellite reflections are slightly different from the experiment: intensity

  difference in the \(a^{*}b^{*}\) plane [Fig. 3(a)] and the streaking along the \(c^{*}\) axis [Fig. 3(c)]. As will be discussed later, such difference is induced by the stacking faults (SF) along the \(c\) axis.

For tetragonal Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\), x-ray diffraction indicated superlattice reflections, which were considered to result from commensurability of Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{2}\) layers with Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) layers [6]. In addition, the superlattice structure was observed in the sister compound Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)(Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) (Ca10-3-8) with the triclinic symmetry [5]. These observations suggest that the doubling of the unit cell is common in the Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)(Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) series (\(n=3,\,4\)). There are five possible variants [Fig. 2(c)] between two adjacent Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\) layers, with shift vectors of \(q_{\rm A}=(-2/5,\,-1/5,\,0)\), \(q_{\rm B}=(1/5,\,-2/5,\,0)\), \(q_{\rm C}=(2/5,\,\,1/5,\,0)\), \(q_{\rm D}=(-1/5,\,\,2/5,\,0)\), and \(q_{\rm O}=0\), i.e., without shifting. The structures reported by different groups (listed in Table 1) can be explained by the combination of the five variants. The tetragonal structure corresponds to the variant O case. The triclinic structure corresponds to one of four variants (A, B, C, D). The monoclinic structure in this work is the combination of variant A and variant C or variant B and variant D. When the five variants distribute randomly along the \(c\) axis, staking faults occur.

Figure 4 shows HAADF-STEM images in the \(ac\) plane defined in Fig. 2. The top panel of Fig. 4(a) shows a region with low density of SFs, and Fig. 4(b) represents a region with high density. SFs occur along the \(c\) axis, as marked by green lines, while solid red rectangle denotes the unit cell of our monoclinic structure. Note that Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) include three variants (B, C, D), with the difference clearly seen in Fig. 4(c). These variants are connected via either SFs as demonstrated in Fig. 4(a) (expanded area) or directly as shown in Fig. 4(b) (expanded area).

SFs are a common defect in layered materials. While SFs may be detected by diffraction techniques such as x-ray diffraction [20], detailed information can only be obtained via STEM as shown in Fig. 4, which reveals the distribution of SFs and their thicknesses and angles with respect to the regular structure. Clearly, stacking faults induce lattice distortions, creating strain [21], pinning [22], and charge redistribution [23] in the crystal. In Fig. 4(d), we plot the measured PtAs-PtAs layer spacing from the HAADF image in Fig. 4(b). The PtAs planar spacing shows slight changes (\(\sim\)1%) at SFs. These distortions will have marked impact on physical properties including superconducting transition temperature [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. As a distortion-free system would result in the maximum \(T_{\rm c}\), the existence of SFs clearly reduces the superconducting transition temperature.

Knowing the crystal structure and nature of the SFs, we can now interpret the physical properties of monoclinic Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\). Figure 5(a) shows the temperature dependence of both the in-plane (\(\rho_{\rm ab}\)) and \(c\)-axis (\(\rho_{\rm c}\)) resistivity of our Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) single crystals, for the temperature range of 2 to 300 K. The overall profile of \(\rho_{\rm ab}\)(\(T\)) is similar to previous observation in samples with tetragonal and triclinic structures [5, 6, 29, 30], i.e., \(\rho_{\rm ab}\)(\(T\)) decreases with decreasing \(T\)(\(d\rho_{\rm ab}\)/\(dT>0\)) in the entire temperature range in a quasicomace fashion. Note that \(\rho_{\rm c}\) also drops at \(T_{\rm c}\), but as was shown in Fig 1(f) the transition is much more gradual than that in the \(ab\) plane. This should be attributed to the imperfection of the sample along the \(c\) direction, including the large unit cell and SFs described above. More strikingly, \(\rho_{\rm c}\) in the normal state increases with decreasing \(T\), i.e., \(d\rho_{\rm c}\)/\(dT<0\). This results in the increase of resistivity anisotropy \(\gamma=\rho_{\rm c}\)/\(\rho_{\rm ab}\) from 17 at 300 K to 55 at 40 K as displayed in Fig. 5(b). The large \(\rho_{\rm c}\)/\(\rho_{\rm ab}\) makes

  Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) one of the most anisotropic materials in the class of Fe-based superconductors [30, 31]. The large anisotropy is most likely a result of directional disorder as discussed in Ref. [27].

While \(\rho_{\rm ab}\) shows metallic behavior, its temperature dependence in the normal state is rather unusual, i.e., neither linear nor quadratic as observed in other FeAs-based compounds [32]. Quantitatively, we find that the normal-state \(\rho_{\rm ab}(T)\) can be described by \(\rho_{\rm ab}(T)=A+B\sqrt{T}\) with \(A=0.079\pm 0.009\) m\(\Omega\) cm and \(B=0.267\pm 0.002\) m\(\Omega\) cm K\({}^{-1/2}\). The solid line in Fig. 4(a) is the fit to experimental data between 50 and 300 K. Since all reported \(\rho_{\rm ab}(T)\) for Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) has the similar temperature dependence regardless of \(T_{\rm c}\) value [5, 6, 30], we believe that the \(\sqrt{T}\) dependence of \(\rho_{\rm ab}\) is intrinsic to this material, and is insensitive to the crystal symmetry.

The nonmetallic \(\rho_{\rm c}(T)\) can be fit using \(A^{\prime}+B^{\prime}\sqrt{T}+C^{\prime}/T\) with \(A^{\prime}=2.6\pm 0.5\) m\(\Omega\) cm, \(B^{\prime}=0.31\pm 0.03\) m\(\Omega\) cm K\({}^{-1/2}\), and \(C^{\prime}=668\pm 29\) m\(\Omega\) cm K. The broken line in Fig. 5(a) is the fit to experimental data between 90 and 300 K. The \(\sqrt{T}\) term (second term) is clearly due to in-plane scattering, which can be intrinsic as Anderson proposed for high-\(T_{\rm c}\) cuprates [33] and/or extrinsic due to stacking faults seen in our crystals (Fig. 4) [24]. The third term (\(T^{-1}\) term) suggests incoherent interlayer scattering, similar to the case for underdoped high-\(T_{\rm c}\) cuprates [33], (Sr\({}_{4}\)V\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{6}\))Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\)[11], NaFe\({}_{1-x}\)Co\({}_{x}\)As [34], and underdoped Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{3}\)As\({}_{8}\)(Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\)[35].

It should be pointed out that the nonmetallic \(\rho_{\rm c}(T)\) observed in our monoclinic Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{0.95}\)Pt\({}_{0.05}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) is unusual, as it is considered as an overdoped sample according to \(T_{\rm c}\) versus \(x\)[4]. On the other hand, the \(\sqrt{T}\) dependence of the electrical resistivity is normally expected at low temperatures in disordered metals and degenerate semiconductors because of interference with scattering by impurities [36, 37]. For our sample, both SFs (Fig. 4) and partial substitution of Fe by Pt in the (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) layer [Fig. 1(b)] should be major causes of disorder. As indicated by the \(T_{\rm c}\) versus \(x\) in Ref. [4], disorder due to Pt doping disfavors superconductivity.

The anomalous in-plane electrical transport is further reflected in the magnetoresistance. Figure 5(c) shows the magnetic field (\(H\)) dependence of in-plane (\(H\|ab\)) MR\({}_{\rm ab}\) with \(H\bot ab\) at various temperatures above \(T_{\rm c}\). Note that, between 40 and 300 K, MR\({}_{\rm ab}\) is positive, and increases with decreasing temperature at a fixed \(H\). Remarkably, at each fixed temperature, MR\({}_{\rm ab}\) exhibits linear-\(H\) dependence between 0 and 14 T. According to the band theory for a single-band solid at the Fermi energy, MR is expected to depend quadratically on \(H\) at low fields and saturate at high fields [38]. For systems with multiple bands at the Fermi energy involving two types of charge carriers, the magnetoresistance can be described by MR \(=aH^{2}/(b+cH^{2})\) (where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) are positive constants) [39]. For both one- and two-band models, a linear-\(H\)-dependent MR is unexpected, especially at low \(H\). More recent theories have attempted to explain linear-\(H\)-dependent MR using classic [40, 41, 42, 43], and quantum approaches [44]. The quantum MR becomes noticeable when \(\hbar\omega_{\rm c}\gg k_{B}T\) (where \(\omega_{\rm c}=eH/m^{*}\) is the cyclotron frequency), i.e., low \(T\), high \(H\), and small electron effective mass \(m^{*}\). For Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\), the linear MR is unlikely due to the quantum effect because it persists to room temperature. According to Parish and Littlewood, linear MR can occur in disordered metals [41] and semiconductors [40] due to multiple scatterings of electrons by disorder.

A powerful probe of disorder effects is the thermal conductivity, as it is sensitive to lattice imperfection [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]. Figure 5(d) displays the temperature dependence of the in-plane thermal conductivity \(\kappa_{\rm ab}\) between 2 and 300 K. In addition to an anomaly due to superconducting transition at \(T_{\rm c}\), the normal-state \(\kappa_{\rm ab}\) is small for a single-crystal solid. We may estimate normal-state electronic contribution \(\kappa_{\rm el}\) via the Wiedemann-Franz law with \(\kappa_{\rm el}=L_{0}T/\rho_{\rm ab}(L_{0}=2.44\times 10^{-8}\) V\({}^{2}\)/K\({}^{2}\)). As shown in Fig. 5(d) (green triangles), \(\kappa_{\rm el}\) decreases with decreasing temperature in the normal state. As a result, the phonon contribution \(\kappa_{\rm ph}\) (\(=\kappa_{\rm ab}-\kappa_{\rm el}\)) increases with decreasing temperature below \(\sim\)250 K [see Fig. 5(d) (red asterisks)], as expected for a single-crystal solid. However, \(\kappa_{\rm ph}\) is only around 1.0 W/K m at room temperature, much lower than that for other FeAs-based layered compounds (\(\geqslant\)2 W/K m) [51, 52], as well as filled skutterudites (\(>\)8 W/K m) [45, 46]. The low-phonon thermal conductivity must be attributed to Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) unique crystallographic structure: the insertion of the skutterudite Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\) layer between Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) layers creates more two-dimensional structure as reflected by high anisotropy in resistivity. The dimensional confinement, large unit cell, stacking faults (plenary defects), and Pt substitution on the Fe site (point defects) can severely lower phonon contribution to the thermal conductivity by reducing phonon mean-free path [47, 48, 49, 50].

In summary, we have experimentally determined the structural, electrical, and thermal transport properties of superconducting Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) single crystals with \(T_{\rm c}=32\) K. Our high-resolution STEM images

Figure 5: (a) Temperature dependence of \(\rho_{\rm ab}\) and \(\rho_{\rm c}\) of Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{0.95}\)Pt\({}_{0.05}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) single crystals, where solid and dashed lines are the fit to \(\rho_{\rm ab}\) and \(\rho_{\rm c}\), respectively; (b) Temperature dependence of resistivity anisotropy \(\rho_{\rm c}/\rho_{\rm ab}\) in the normal state; (c) Magnetic-field dependence of in-plane MR\({}_{\rm ab}\) at indicated temperatures and configuration. (c) Temperature dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity (black dots). In the normal state, both electron (triangles) and phonon (asterisks) contributions are estimated.

  clearly reveal the structure with a doubling of the _c_-axis lattice parameter compared with the previously determined tetragonal and triclinic structures. Combined with electron diffraction, the crystal symmetry is identified to be monoclinic with the space group \(P2_{1}/n\). STEM also provides direct evidence for Pt doping in the Fe\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) layer and indigenous stacking faults along the \(c\) axis. We find that the square-root temperature dependence and linear-field dependence of \(\rho_{\text{ab}}\), nonmetallic \(\rho_{\text{c}}\), very low phonon thermal conductivity can be attributed to the unique structure of Ca\({}_{10}\)Pt\({}_{4}\)As\({}_{8}\)((Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\))\({}_{5}\) with large unit cell, stacking faults, and Pt doping in (Fe\({}_{1-x}\)Pt\({}_{x}\))\({}_{2}\)As\({}_{2}\) layers. The physical properties are very different from the individual building blocks as a consequence of the structure.
