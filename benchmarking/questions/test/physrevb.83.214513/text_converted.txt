###### Abstract

We have constructed a pressure-temperature (_P_-_T_) phase diagram of
_P_-induced superconductivity in EuFe₂As₂ single crystals via
resistivity (ρ) measurements up to 3.2 GPa. As hydrostatic pressure is
applied, the temperature T0 where an antiferromagnetic (AF) transition
of the Fe moments and a structural phase transition occur shifts to
lower temperatures, and the corresponding resistive anomaly becomes
undetectable for P >= 2.5 GPa. This suggests that the critical pressure
P_(c) where T0 becomes zero is about 2.5 GPa. We have found that the AF
order of the Eu²⁺ moments survives up to 3.2 GPa, the highest pressure
in the experiments, without significant changes in the AF ordering
temperature T_(N). The superconducting (SC) ground state with a sharp
transition to zero resistivity at T_(c)   30 K, indicative of bulk
superconductivity, emerges in a pressure range from P_(c)   2.5 to   3.0
GPa. At pressures close to but outside the SC phase, the ρ(T) curve
shows a partial SC transition (i.e., zero resistivity is not attained)
followed by a reentrant-like hump at approximately T_(N) with decreasing
temperature. When nonhydrostatic pressure with a uniaxial-like strain
component is applied using a solid pressure medium, the partial
superconductivity is continuously observed in a wide pressure range from
1.1 to 3.2 GPa.

## II Experimental details

Single crystals of EuFe₂As₂ were grown by the Bridgman method from a
stoichiometric mixture of the constituent elements. In this study, we
used several crystals labeled as samples ^(#)1-^(#)5, which were taken
from the same batch [residual resistivity ratio (RRR) = 7] as used in
our previous works. [9, 10, 11, 12] High-pressure resistivity
measurements up to 3.2 GPa have been performed under zero applied
magnetic field in a ⁴He cryostat down to 1.6 K, using a clamped piston
cylinder pressure device. [33] Electrical resistivity was measured by a
conventional four-probe method with an ac current of I∼0.3 mA (frequency
of 10-20 Hz) for the direction I ∥ ab. We used two types of
pressure-transmitting medium, Daphne 7474 (Idemitsu Kosan) [34] and
Stycast 1266 (cured by Catalyst), to produce a hydrostatic or
nonhydrostatic pressure, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. Daphne 7474
remains in the liquid state up to 3.7 GPa at room temperature (RT). [34]
To avoid an abrupt solidification of the pressure medium, which could be
a cause of nonhydrostatic pressure, the cooling speed was regulated at
an average value of 0.5 K/min. The generated pressure was determined at
4.2 K from the relative resistance change of Manganin wires. The
insulation-coated Manganin wires with a diameter of 0.1 mm and a
resistance of 0.7 Ω/cm, which were coiled a few turns, were exposed to
high pressure and low temperature a few times in advance before the
measurements. It should be noted that the resistance of Manganin wires
was always measured under the same hydrostatic condition using Daphne
7474 pressure medium (Fig. 1). This permits a direct comparison of the
pressure values for all the setups, irrespective of the employed
pressure medium, as in Fig. 6(e). In this paper, we present three
independent resistivity experiments using (i) samples ^(#)1 and ^(#)2
and Manganin ^(#)a and ^(#)b (Daphne 7474), (ii) sample ^(#)3 (Daphne
7474), and (iii) samples ^(#)4 and ^(#)5 (Stycast 1266). The assemblies
of the samples and the Manganin wires are illustrated in Fig. 1. Note
that P = 0 GPa data were obtained by applying a pressure of 0.2 GPa at
RT, considering a reduction of pressure with decreasing temperature.

## III Results and discussions

### High-pressure resistivity data

Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity, ρ(T),
of EuFe₂As₂ (sample ^(#)1; Daphne 7474) under hydrostatic pressures up
to 2.6 GPa. At 0 GPa, ρ(T) shows cusp-like behavior at T₀ = 188 K as
indicated by an arrow. This is attributed to the AF transition related
to the FeAs layers, [14, 15, 16, 17] which coincides with a structural
transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry. [18] With
increasing pressure, the resistive cusp is gradually suppressed and
shifts to lower temperatures. As indicated by arrows in Fig. 2(b), we
define T₀ as the temperature where dρ/dT exhibits its minimum. The
minimum in dρ/dT can be identified up to 2.4 GPa, although only faintly
visible at 2.4 GPa. At 2.6 GPa, resistivity follows approximately
T-linear behavior in a broad temperature range above T_(c) = 30 K
without a noticeable signature associated with T₀, consistent with
previous reports. [9, 11, 12] Thus the critical pressure P_(c), where
T₀ → 0, is about 2.5 GPa. [35] It remains to be resolved whether the
simultaneous AF/structural transition

shifted for clarity.

the high-pressure resistivity measurements: (a) samples ^(#)1 (^(#)3)
and ^(#)2, and Manganin ^(#)a and ^(#)b; (b) samples ^(#)4 and ^(#)5,
and Manganin ^(#)c. Samples ^(#)1-^(#)3 and all Manganin wires are

in EuFe₂As₂ splits into two individual transitions by applying pressure.
A separation of the two transitions might explain broad transitions
observed under high pressure. The separation has been observed in
"1111"36 and doped "122" compounds [37] at ambient pressure.

As shown by arrows in Fig. 2(c), the AF order of the localized Eu²⁺
moments under applied pressure is evidenced by distinctive changes in
ρ(T) around 20 K. It is of interest that the shape of the ρ(T) curve
near T_(N) varies with increasing pressure. For low pressures (P≤ 0.6
GPa), ρ(T) exhibits a sudden decrease below T_(N). For 1.1 ≤P≤ 1.9 GPa,
ρ(T) shows an enhancement at T_(N) followed by a peak-like behavior as
temperature decreases. A similar feature in ρ(T) at T_(N) has also been
observed in several AF metals with localized moments and is generally
attributed to a superzone effect arising from a gap formation associated
with a periodic arrangement of the magnetic moments. [38] At 1.9 GPa,
one can see a resistive kink at 31 K, which we ascribe as an onset
temperature of a SC transition (T_(c)^(on)). With increasing pressure,
the kink evolves into a marked decrease in resistivity below T_(c)^(on),
and the SC transition attains zero resistivity at 2.4 GPa for this
sample, although the transition width is very broad. At 2.6 GPa
(>P_(c)), where the bulk superconductivity was confirmed by our
ac-susceptibility (χ) measurements, [9]ρ(T) shows a sharp SC transition
to zero resistivity. The humplike behavior attributed to T_(N) is
distinctly signaled below T_(c)^(on) for 1.9 and 2.2 GPa, but not for
2.4 and 2.6 GPa.

Figure 3(a) shows the low-temperature magnification of ρ(T) data for
EuFe₂As₂ (sample [9]; Daphne 747), under several pressures up to 3.2
GPa. Unlike the result for sample [41], the ρ(T) curve at 2.4 GPa shows
a partial SC transition, but it does not reach zero resistivity. As
pressure increases, the SC transition gradually shifts to lower
temperatures. At 3.1 GPa, with decreasing temperature, ρ(T) exhibits a
slightly broader transition to zero resistivity, followed by a humplike
behavior, and then returns to zero resistivity again. At 3.2 GPa, the
ρ(T) curve with the humplike behavior no longer reaches zero down to the
lowest temperature of 1.6 K. It is noted that the resistive hump is
observed at similar temperatures at 2.4 and 3.2 GPa. This is consistent
with the results of ρ, ac-χ, and ac-calorimetry measurements under
higher pressure, [13] which demonstrate that the AF order of the Eu²⁺
moments remains up to ∼ 8 GPa with only a moderate increase in T_(N).

The width of the SC transition ΔT_(c), defined as
T_(c)^(on) − T_(c)^(ρ = 0), is estimated to be 1.5 K at 2.5 GPa [see the
inset of Fig. 3(a) for the definition of T_(c)^(on) and T_(c)^(ρ = 0)].
As shown in Fig. 4, with increasing pressure, the transition becomes
sharper and, at 2.7 GPa, ΔT_(c) shows a minimum value of 1 K (or 0.6 K
when the width is defined by the 90

Figure 3(b) shows ρ(T) data of EuFe₂As₂ at 2.5 GPa (∼P_(c)) under
several current values up to I = 200 mA, which corresponds to the
current density of ∼ 500 A/cm². At 0.3 mA, the ρ(T) curve exhibits a
sharp SC transition without a reentrant-like hump due to the AF order of
the Eu²⁺ moments. At 50 mA, one can slightly see an appearance of the
humplike behavior around 22 K, most likely attributed to T_(N). With
increasing current up to 200 mA, the hump becomes more noticeable,
although the resistivity peak is only 0.2 μΩ cm at 200 mA, which is ∼0.4

### Pressure-temperature phase diagram

In Fig. 4, we illustrate the P-T phase diagram of the characteristic
temperatures, T₀, T_(N), and T_(c) (T_(c)^(ρ = 0) and T_(c)^(ρ = 0)) in
EuFe₂As₂ (samples [41]-[43]; Daphne 747), determined from the ρ(T) data
under hydrostatic pressures up to 3.2 GPa. Our findings on the phase
diagram are summarized as (i)-(iv). (i) The pressure evolution of T₀ and
T_(N) is consistent with that obtained by Miclea _et al._ (Ref. [8]) and
Matsubayashi _et al._ (Ref. [13]). T₀ disappears for P≥ 2.5 GPa (P_(c)∼
2.5 GPa), whereas T_(N) survives up to at least 3.2 GPa. (ii) T_(c)^(on)
emerges from 1.9 GPa, although the partial SC transition with nonzero
resistivity is probably filamentary for P< 2.4 GPa, as was revealed by
previous ac-χ measurements at 2.2 GPa. [9] Likewise, nonbulk
superconductivity for the 3.2 GPa data can be inferred from the similar
partial SC transition.

Figure 3: (Color online) (a) Low-temperature expanded view of ρ(T) data
for EuFe₂As₂ (sample [43]; Daphne 747) under several pressures up to 3.2
GPa. As illustrated in the inset using the data at 2.9 GPa, T_(c)^(on)
and T_(c)^(ρ = 0) are determined by the onset and ρ = 0 of the SC
transition. (b) ρ(T) data at 2.5 GPa for several current values up to
I = 200 mA (∼ 500 A/cm²). Shifts of SC transitions and resistive humps
to lower temperatures as current increases may not be intrinsic, and are
most likely attributed to a joule heating effect.

(iii) At 2.4 GPa ( ≲ P_(c)), the SC transition attains zero resistivity
for some samples, such as samples ^(#)1 and ^(#)2 (not for sample
^(#)3), but the width is broadened (ΔT_(c)∼ 5 K). This is likely due to
an internal strain and/or composition inhomogeneity, which may bring
T₀ → 0 at some parts of a crystal, and consequently induce partial
superconductivity. A similar scenario can also be applied to the 3.1 GPa
data where the width of the SC transition to zero resistivity is
broadened. (iv) Bulk superconductivity exists in narrow pressures of 2.5
( ∼ P_(c)) to ∼ 3.0 GPa, judging from the sharp SC transitions to zero
resistivity.

Reference [8] shows that a partial SC transition with a reentrant-like
hump is continuously observed up to 2.6 GPa even above P_(c), whereas it
is noticeable only at the outer boundaries of the SC phase (P < P_(c) or
P> 3 GPa) in our case. As claimed in Ref. [13] and supported by our
results in the following section, the absence of zero-resistivity
transition in Ref. [8] may be caused by a nonhydrostatic pressure
effect.

The loss of bulk superconductivity above ∼ 3 GPa is in conflict, we
found, with a previous claim in Ref. [43] that a P-induced SC state in
EuFe₂As₂ exists up to ∼ 16 GPa, and that the T_(c) value attains its
maximum of 41 K around 10 GPa. In Ref. [43], tiny resistivity drops
observed in the wide pressure range were attributed to SC transitions.
However, those drops are most likely due to magnetic ordering of the
Eu²⁺ moments, as clearly demonstrated by magnetic measurements on
EuFe₂As₂ in Ref. [13]. The claim in Ref. [44] that EuFe₂As_(1.4)P_(0.6)
superconducts up to ∼ 20 GPa is also questionable, since the
superconductivity is based only on observations of slight resistivity
drops.

Recently, systematic studies of P-doping effects at the As site in
EuFe₂As₂ have been reported. [45] The phase diagram as a function of
dopant concentration is roughly consistent with that as a function of
pressure. For both cases, the SC phases are confined in a narrow dopant
or pressure regime, whereas magnetic orders of the Eu²⁺ moments remain
in all dopant levels or up to extremely high pressures [∼20 GPa (Ref.
[13]]). On the other hand, there seems to be a difference between the
two tuning parameters regarding at which concentration or pressure the
magnetic order of the Eu²⁺ moments changes from AF to FM. [13, 45] The
AF-FM transition occurs at about 8 Pa, which is a much higher pressure
than that of the SC phase for the pressure case, [13] whereas it
coincides with the boundary of the SC phase on the overdoping side for
the doping case. [45]

### Hydrostatic versus nonhydrostatic pressure

Although Daphne 7474 remains in a liquid state up to 3.7 GPa at RT, [34]
it eventually solidifies with decreasing temperature. We have therefore
checked the hydrostaticity of the generated pressure at low temperatures
by performing simultaneous resistivity measurements using two Manganin
wires and two EuFe₂As₂ crystals: Manganin ^(#)a and sample ^(#)1 are
mounted parallel to the load axis, and Manganin ^(#)b and sample ^(#)2
in the perpendicular direction, as displayed in Fig. 1(a). Since a
Manganin wire is highly sensitive to nonhydrostatic pressure, two sets
of Manganin wires aligned as Manganin ^(#)a and ^(#)b are often used to
estimate the degree of hydrostaticity of a pressure medium. [46] When
the pressure medium becomes nonhydrostatic, the resistance change ratio
ΔR [= (R − R₀)/R₀ (R₀: resistance at ambient pressure)] is expected to
deviate significantly from each other. In the case of Daphne 7474, as
seen in the upper inset of Fig. 5, ΔR for Manganin ^(#)a and ^(#)b
estimated at 4.2 K is almost identical up to the investigated highest
pressure of 2.6 GPa ( > P_(c)). This indicates that the low-temperature
pressure produced via the Daphne 7474 pressure medium is satisfactorily
hydrostatic up to at least 2.6 GPa, where the P-induced
superconductivity shows up in EuFe₂As₂.

The main panel of Fig. 5 shows ρ(T) data of EuFe₂As₂ for samples ^(#)1
(circle symbols) and ^(#)2 (dotted curves) up to 2.6 GPa. For clarity,
the data are arbitrarily shifted in the longitudinal direction. The
pressure evolutions of the two ρ(T) curves are similar to each other, as
can also be inferred from the phase diagram in Fig. 4, suggesting no
significant nonhydrostatic pressure effect. The small difference between
the data is likely attributed to the sample dependence.

Finally, we discuss the effects of nonhydrostatic pressures with
uniaxial-like strain components on the SC phase diagram of EuFe₂As₂.
Figure 6 shows ρ(T) data of EuFe₂As₂ at several pressures up to 3.2 GPa
for the samples (a) ^(#)4 and (b) ^(#)5, simultaneously measured using
Stycast 1266 (cured by Catalyst) as a solid pressure medium. Samples
^(#)4 and *5 are mounted parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to
the load axis [see Fig. 1(b)]. In this setup, samples ^(#)4 and *5 are
expected to receive a uniaxial-like strain more on the ab plane and c
axis directions, respectively, as in the illustrations. [47]
Interestingly, application of 0.2 GPa at RT

ΔT_(c) ( = T_(c)^(∞) − T_(c)^(ε = 0)) in EuFe₂As₂ (samples ^(#)1−^(#)3;
Daphne 7474), deduced from the ρ(T) data up to 3.2 GPa. PM, AFM, and SC
indicate the paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and superconducting
states, respectively. For the SC state, open and solid symbols indicate
$T_{c}^{\rm on}$ and T_(c)^(ε = 0), respectively. As indicated by an
arrow, the critical pressure (P_(c)), where T₀ → 0, is about 2.5 GPa.
Dashed curves are eye guides. For comparison, data from Refs. [8] and
[13] are also shown.

(P = 0 GPa data) produces contrasting ρ(T) curves between the two
different alignments, although ρ(T) curves at higher pressures are
qualitatively similar to each other. For both cases, the resistive
transition associated with T₀ is rapidly broadened with increasing
pressure, which makes it difficult to unambiguously determine T₀ values.
However, it is noted that a convex curvature associated with T₀ is still
observable at 3.2 GPa for both samples.

As shown in Figs. 6(b) and 6(d), ρ(T) curves for two alignments show
partial SC transitions below $T_{\rm c}^{\rm on}\sim 30$ K with
reentrant-like behavior near T_(N), but never reach zero resistivity, in
a wide pressure range from 1.1 to 3.2 GPa. The result is similar to that
obtained using silicon oil[8] and Daphne 7373[13, 48] pressure media. It
is found that the uniaxial-like strain parallel to the c axis is more
detrimental to the superconductivity than that parallel to the ab plane,
since the drop in resistivity below $T_{\rm c}^{\rm on}$ is more salient
with a much smaller residual resistivity for the latter case. This may
relate to the fact that the convex curvature due to T₀ is more
suppressed when the uniaxial-like strain is applied parallel to the ab
plane. Thus a suppression of T₀ could be an important key to stabilizing
the superconductivity. Indeed, bulk superconductivity with zero
resistivity emerges with a complete suppression of T₀ in the case of
Daphne 7474.

Figure 6(e) illustrates the pressure evolutions of T_(N) and
$T_{\rm c}^{\rm on}$ for samples ^(#)4 and ^(#)5 (Stycast 1266) up to
3.2 GPa. For comparison, T_(N) and $T_{\rm c}^{\rm on}$ obtained using
Daphne 7474 pressure medium for sample ^(#)3 are also shown. The shaded
area corresponds to the SC phase under hydrostatic pressure where the SC
transition attains zero resistivity, indicative of bulk
superconductivity. Notably, T_(N) for all the samples exhibits quite
similar pressure evolutions with a moderate increase, independently of
the pressure medium and of the direction of uniaxial-like strain. On the
other hand, the phase diagram obtained via Stycast 1266 is crucially
different from that via Daphne 7474, in terms of the superconductivity.
When Stycast 1266 is used, an onset of the SC transition can be found
from a lower pressure of 1.1 GPa (compared with 1.9 GPa in the case of
Daphne 7474), and resistivity does not reach zero up to 3.2 GPa. These
facts indicate that nonhydrostatic pressure can induce a partial SC
transition at low pressures but is detrimental to the bulk
superconductivity, whereas it has no significant effect on the AF order
of the Eu²⁺ moments.

## IV Summary

High-pressure resistivity measurements up to 3.2 GPa have been performed
on EuFe₂As₂ single crystals to establish the phase diagrams of the
P-induced superconductivity. We have

found that a sharp SC transition to zero resistivity, indicating bulk
superconductivity, appears in a limited pressure range of 2.5 (∼P_(c))
to ∼3.0 GPa, with a complete suppression of T₀ by applying hydrostatic
pressure using Daphne 7474 pressure medium. By contrast, application of
nonhydrostatic pressure produced via Stycast 1266 brings only a partial
SC transition without zero resistivity in a broad pressure range for P≥
1.1 GPa. It is also found that the AF order of the Eu²⁺ moments persists
up to the highest measured pressure of 3.2 GPa with a moderate increase
in T_(N), independently of the hydrostaticity of applied pressure.
