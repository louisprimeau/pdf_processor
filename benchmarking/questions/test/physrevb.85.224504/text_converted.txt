###### Abstract

We have studied the Fe-based superconductor
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ in order to identify the
structure of the order parameter in this system by performing extensive
low-temperature specific heat measurements in zero and in applied
magnetic field. The pronounced superconducting jump at T_(c) = 32.5 K
and Δ_(b)/(k_(B)T_(c)) = 2.57 indicate strong-coupling superconductivity
in this material. Here we provide evidence for fully gapped
superconductivity in Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂. A linear
magnetic field dependence of the low-temperature specific heat points to
s-wave symmetry of the order parameter. Below T_(c) the superconducting
electronic part of the specific heat can be described by the BCS α model
with Δ₀ = 7.2 meV.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B **85**, 224504 (2012)

The discovery of superconductivity in Fe-based pnictides [1, 2] opened a
new chapter in superconductivity (SC) research. [3] Several types of
superconducting families containing FeAs layers have been identified and
studied, but the main focus has been on the "122" family of compounds,
[4, 5, 6] for its favorable metallurgical properties and since large
single crystals can be easily synthesized. In these materials the
superconducting gap structure is often discussed within the nodeless
isotropic and anisotropic s_(±) model (extended s wave), with a sign
reversal of the order parameter between the electron and the hole Fermi
surfaces. [7, 8, 9, 10] However, the nodal s_(±) and d_(x² − y²) models
have also been theoretically suggested, and a possible change of the
pairing symmetry upon doping has been proposed. [11, 12, 13] Despite the
large theoretical and experimental efforts (see Refs. [14] and [15]) the
understanding of the nature of the superconductivity in these materials
as well as the pairing mechanism and the symmetry of the order parameter
are still under debate.

One way to elucidate the nature of the superconductivity is to study the
low-temperature heat capacity since the temperature dependence of the
specific heat and its magnetic response in the superconducting state
give important information about the symmetry of the superconducting
gap. [16, 17, 18] Introducing impurities into a superconductor is a good
probe for determining the precise low-energy density of states and,
hence, the nature of the superconducting order parameter. In multiband
superconductors, it is expected that the impurity scattering within each
band tends to make the gap on the corresponding FS sheet more isotropic
and may result in lifting of the nodes and removal of the low-energy
excitations. The superconducting temperature would also be reduced. [19,
20] In optimally doped BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂ specific heat studies [21,
22, 23, 24] indicate the multiband nature of the superconductivity and
an evolution of the gap structure with doping. [25, 26] Moreover, the
temperature and field dependence of C_(p)(T, H) can be well explained by
the s_(±) model by taking into account intra- and interband interactions
in the presence of disorder. [26, 27] The situation is much less clear
in Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂. At optimal doping specific heat studies
suggest fully gapped superconductivity [29, 30] and multiple gaps [31]
but the possibility for a nodal gap in this material and its evolution
upon doping or disorder remain a central question in the ongoing debate.
[32, 33, 34]

Here we address this problem by investigating the specific heat of the
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ superconductor with T_(c) = 32.5
K. By substitution of K on the Ba site the sample is close to the
optimal doping regime. [35] An additional disorder is introduced to the
material by a direct doping into the "active" FeAs layers by Co. It has
been shown in BaFe_(2 − x)Co_(x)As₂[25, 26] that the doping into the
FeAs layers strongly influences the superconducting order parameter and
leads to the change of the gap structure from a fully gapped SC for
optimally doped sample to a nodal SC upon doping by cobalt. [25, 26, 27]
Initially, combined co-doping by K and Co aimed to enhance the
high-field high-current performance of the superconductor, i.e., to
achieve higher values of the upper critical field H_(c2). [28] By using
extensive low-temperature specific heat studies we show evidence for
fully gapped superconductivity in the
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂. The size of the superconducting
jump at T_(c) and the gap value indicate strong-coupling
superconductivity in this sample. The normal state Sommerfeld
coefficient is determined as 40.5 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻². By subtracting the
lattice contribution we extract the full electronic T dependence. It can
be described by the BCS α model with Δ₀ = 7.2 meV. The field-induced
change in the low-temperature specific heat shows a linear H dependence
consistent with s-wave symmetry of the order parameter.

The samples were synthesized by a powder metallurgical technique as
described in Ref. [28]. The heat capacity was measured between 1.8 K and
300 K in a commercial system (PPMS, Quantum Design) using a
thermal-relaxation technique.

The temperature dependence of the specific heat of
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ is shown in Fig. 1. At low
temperature no sign of any upturns or Schottky-like anomalies are
observed at zero or in any applied magnetic fields. At the transition a
pronounced anomaly is observed in the C_(p)(T) curve and the
entropy-conserving construction gives T_(c) = 32.5 K (see the dashed
lines in the upper inset of Fig. 1). This T_(c) is consistent with a
zero resistance value of the electrical resistivity [28]. At T_(c) the
specific heat jump, determined at zero field, is
$\frac{\Delta C}{T}|_{T}=$ 118 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻². It is comparable to the
previous specific heat studies of the optimally doped
Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂[29; 30; 31; 36]. By taking into account γ_(N)=
40.5 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻² (see below) the normalized C_(p) jump
$\frac{\Delta C}{T_{N}}|_{T_{c}}=$ 2.9 is much larger than the expected
weak coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) value of 1.43, indicating
strong-coupling superconductivity in
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂. As seen in Fig. 2(a) an applied
magnetic field depresses the superconducting anomaly and gradually
shifts the transition down to lower temperatures. At μ₀H= 9 T the T_(c)
is reduced by only 0.8 K, pointing to the large critical field in this
system. As shown in Fig. 2(b), T_(c) decreases linearly upon applied
magnetic field with the slope of $\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}=-$10 T K⁻¹. This
agrees well with the electrical resistivity data [28], and it is close
to the one observed for optimally doped Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂[31]. From
the slope of the critical field the value of H_(c2) may be evaluated by
the Werthammer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model [37; 38]. In this approach
(taking into account the orbital effect only; Maki parameter α= 0) the
critical field may be expressed as
$H_{c2}^{orb}=0.69\times T_{c}[\frac{dH_{c2}}{dT}]_{T_{c}}$ and for
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ if gives 224 T. As has been shown
recently the actual H_(c2) for this material is about 70 T (see Ref.
[28]). This could point to the multiband SC in this material. Moreover,
the Pauli field estimated as H_(c2)^(P)= 1.84 ×T_(c)= 60 T could
indicate the importance of Pauli paramagnetism as a pair breaking
mechanism in this material.

Now we evaluate the possible gap scenario in
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂. The magnetic field and
temperature dependencies of the low-temperature specific heat are
excellent probes of the gap structure in superconductors. For a fully
gapped SC the number of Caroli-de Gennes bound states increases linearly
with field due to the linear increase in the number of vortices entering
the sample. Therefore γ_(el)(H) ∝ H (see Ref. [39]). On the other hand,
an anisotropic gap will cause the specific heat to deviate from the
H-linear dependence [40]. In a clean d-wave superconductor the
quasiparticle excitation spectrum is shifted by the superfluid velocity,
giving $\gamma_{el}(H)\propto\sqrt{H}$ (Ref. [41]) where the
quasiparticles contributing to the density of states are coming from
regions away from vortex cores, close to the nodes [41]. In the presence
of disorder the $\gamma_{el}(H)\propto\sqrt{H}$ behavior changes to
γ_(el)(H) ∝ HlnH (Ref. [42]).

Ref. [26] respectively.

can be fitted by C(T) = γ T + βT³ as shown in Fig. 3. For the zero-field
data the parameters obtained are γ_(el)(0) = 2.24 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻² and
β = 0.78 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻⁴. It’s worth noting that γ₀ is one of the smallest
values observed within the K-doped Ba122 systems and indicates a very
good quality and purity of the polycrystalline sample. The ratio of the
residual specific heat to its normal-state value results in an upper
estimate of the non-superconducting fraction γ₀/γ_(N) ≈ 5% (assuming
that no low-energy electronic excitations are coming from pair-breaking
effects). To derive the magnetic field dependence of γ_(el)(H) the same
procedure as for zero field has been applied [see Fig. 3(a)]. For all
fits the parameter β has a very similar value indicating independence of
the phonon contribution to the magnetic field. The obtained γ_(el)(H) is
presented in Fig. 3(b). As seen γ_(el) increases linearly with the
magnetic field as anticipated for fully gapped superconductivity [45].
The total increase of γ_(el)(H) at 9 T is 5.3 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻². A linear
slope a marked as a dashed line in Fig. 3(b) is related to the normal
state Sommerfeld coefficient and critical field by a = γ_(N)/H_(c2).
Taking H_(c2) = 70 T as derived from high-field measurements [28] the
estimated γ_(N) is 42 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻², which agrees well with the value
obtained from the temperature dependence (see below). Figure 3(c) shows
a normalized field-induced change in low-temperature specific heat
$\frac{\Delta\gamma_{el}}{\gamma_{N}}$ versus normalized magnetic field
$\frac{H}{H_{c2}}$ where Δγ_(el) = γ_(el)(H) − γ₀. In the same figure
data obtained for the d-wave superconductor La_(1.85)Sr_(0.15)CuO₄[44,
43] and the fully gapped s-wave superconductor
BaFe_(1.84)Co_(0.16)As₂[26] are shown for comparison.

To estimate the electronic contribution to the total specific heat the
phonon part of C_(p) has to be reliably determined. However, it is
challenging to directly measure the normal state in
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ due to the very high H_(c2) in
this material. Therefore, we model the specific heat above the
superconducting transition temperature and extrapolate it to below T_(c)
(see Ref. [30]). As shown by the solid line in Fig. 1, above T_(c), the
C_(p)(T) curve can be fitted by the expression

$$C_{\rm p}(T)=\gamma_{N}T+(1-k)C_{\rm D}(T)+kC_{\rm E}(T),$$
(1)

in which the lattice contribution to the specific heat is accounted for
by considering both Debye C_(D)(T) and Einstein C_(E)(T) functions with
the k parameter ensuring the proper quantity of oscillator modes
involved. The least-squares fit of this formula to the experimental data
above 35 K yields the following parameters: γ_(n) = 40.5 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻²,
$\Theta_{\rm D}=195$ K, $\Theta_{\rm E}=348$ K, and k = 0.47. It is
worth noting that the value of the normal state Sommerfeld coefficient
is very similar to the one obtained from the field dependence and agrees
well with γ_(N) derived for optimally doped Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (see
Refs. [29] and [30]). The normal state electronic specific heat is
larger than the value obtained from DFT calculations, γ_(n) = 10.1 mJ
mol⁻¹ K⁻², obtained for Ba_(0.68)K_(0.38)Fe₂As₂[31]. This could point
towards the strong mass renormalization by a factor of 4 in
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂. The Debye and Einstein
temperatures are close to those obtained for Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂
samples [30]. Moreover, the normal state γ_(N) obtained provides an
accurate entropy balance for the electronic specific heat below T_(c).
As shown in the lower inset in Fig. 1 the electronic entropies in the
superconducting and normal states are equal at T_(c) satisfying the
entropy constraint. Furthermore, the superconducting characteristics
that we obtain from the resulting analysis are consistent with each
other and with other measurements (see Refs. [46, 47, 48]). Using the
normal state specific heat we derive the condensation energy [obtained
by integrating the entropy difference
$U=\frac{H_{c2}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}=\int\{S_{n}(T)-S_{x}(T)\}\,dT$ in normal
S_(n)(T) and superconducting state S_(x)(T)] and relate it to the
thermodynamical critical field H_(c). The obtained values are U = 9.6 J
mol⁻¹ and H_(c) = 0.63 T, respectively. Taking H_(c2) = 70 T the
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter K = 78 can be obtained from
$H_{c2}=\sqrt{2}K\,H_{c}$. Its large value clearly points to type-II
superconductivity in Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂. The GL
coherence length ξ = 2.2 nm, lower critical field H_(c1) = 24 mT, and
penetration depth λ = 170 nm can be derived from
$\xi=[\frac{\phi}{2\pi H_{c2}}]^{1/2}$, where ϕ is the magnetic flux
quanta and H_(c1)H_(c2) = H_(c)²ln K. The parameters are similar to the
ones obtained for optimally doped BaK-122 system [48], providing
additional confidence in our phonon substraction.

Figure 4 shows the electronic specific heat at zero field after
subtracting the lattice contribution. In order to analyze the C_(el)/T
data we use the BCS α model [49] for specific heat:

$$C_{el}^{\rm BCS}=t\,\frac{d}{dt}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!dy\!\left(-\frac{6\gamma \,\Delta_{0}}{k_{B}\pi}\right)\![f\,\ln f+(1-f)\ln(1-f)],$$
(2)

where t = T/T_(c), f is the Fermi function f = (e^(E/k_(B)T) + 1)⁻¹,
$E=\sqrt{\epsilon^{2}+\Delta^{2}}$, and y = ϵ/Δ (see Ref. [50]), plus a
residual normal state component.

The results of our analysis using a single s-wave gap (solid red line)
and two separate s-wave gaps (dashed blue line) are shown in Fig. 4. The
normal state Sommerfeld coefficient and T_(c) = 32.5 K were fixed during
the fitting procedure. The gap value obtained from the single gap fit is
7.2 meV. Taking Δ₀ = 7.2 meV and T_(c) = 32.5 K gives
Δ₀/(k_(B)T_(c)) = 2.57, much larger than the weak coupling limit of
1.76. As can be seen from Fig. 4 a better description (especially above
15 K)

specific heat of Ba_(0.65)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂. The solid and
dashed lines are theoretical curves based on BCS theory by taking into
account one and two s-wave gaps, respectively (see text). Inset: Scaling

is obtained by fitting the data to
$C_{el}(T)=(1-A)C_{el}^{\rm BCS}\Delta_{1}+AC_{el}^{\rm BCS}\Delta_{2}$
which gives the dashed blue line and the parameters Δ₁ = 7.9 meV,
Δ₂ = 2.4 meV, and A = 0.14. This can be compared with Δ₁ = 11 meV,
Δ₂ = 3.5 meV obtained by the specific heat studies of
Ba_(0.68)K_(0.33)Fe₂As₂ with $T_{\rm c}=38.5$ K (see Ref. [31]). This is
also consistent with ARPES and STM measurements obtained for optimally
doped Ba_(1 − x)K_(x)Fe₂As₂ samples (see Refs. [51; 52]) but similar
measurements are not available for co-doped samples. However, even
though the two-gap description represents the data somewhat better than
the one-gap approach, there is still some discrepancy between the model
and the experimental data observed below 15 K (see Fig. 4). Therefore,
taking into account the ambiguity of the phonon substraction it is
difficult to draw any firm conclusion on the multiband nature of the
superconductivity in Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ by specific
heat measurements only.

In the s-wave superconductors, quasiparticle excitations are governed by
the inner-core states. Taking into account the specific heat of the
quasiparticles induced by magnetic field (γ_(qp)) and that coming from
the vortex cores ($\gamma_{\rm core}$), a straightforward scaling
behavior
$\gamma_{\rm core}/T^{2}\sim\gamma_{qp}/T^{2}=\frac{\gamma_{qp}}{H_{x1}}[\frac{ T}{\sqrt{H}}]^{-2}$
is observed.[29; 53] As seen in the inset in Fig. 4 all the data
obtained for Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ can roughly be
scaled to the straight line being in agreement with the field data
above.

To summarize, we have studied the co-doped Fe-based superconductor
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ in order to identify the
structure of the order parameter in this system by performing extensive
low-temperature specific heat measurements in zero and in applied
magnetic fields. It is a superconductor at 32.5 K as marked by a
pronounced jump in C_(p)(T) at the transition temperature. At T_(c) the
superconducting jump $\frac{\Delta C}{\Gamma_{T\rm N}}|_{T_{c}}=2.9$ and
the normalized gap Δ₀/(k_(B)T_(c)) = 2.57 indicate strong-coupling
superconductivity in this material. It could suggest strong interaction
with interband spin fluctuations as a potential pairing mechanism.[31]
Using the phonon part of the specific heat obtained from the
high-temperature fit, we determine the normal state Sommerfeld
coefficient to be 40.5 mJ mol⁻¹ K⁻². All the results obtained point to a
fully gapped nature of the superconducting gap. The field-induced change
in the low-temperature specific heat shows a linear H dependence
consistent with s-wave symmetry of the order parameter. Below T_(c) the
electronic part of the specific heat of
Ba_(0.55)K_(0.45)Fe_(1.95)Co_(0.05)As₂ is described well by the BCS α
model with Δ₀ = 7.2 meV.
