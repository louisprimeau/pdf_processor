###### Abstract

The specific heat C(T) of iron-based high-T_{c} superconductor SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs (0 \leq x \leq 0.2) was systematically studied. For the undoped x = 0 sample, a specific heat jump was observed at 130 K. This is attributed to the structural or spin-density-wave transition, which also manifests on resistivity as a rapid drop. However, this jump disappears with slight F doping in the x = 0.05 sample, although the resistivity drop still exists. The specific heat C/T shows clear anomaly near T_{c} for x = 0.15 and 0.20 superconducting samples. Such anomaly has been absent in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. For the parent compound SmOFeAs, C(T) shows a sharp peak at 4.6 K, and with electron doping in the x = 0.15 sample, this peak shifts to 3.7 K. It is interpreted that such a sharp peak results from the antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm^{3+} ions in this system, which mimics the electron-doped high-T_{c} cuprate Sm_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}

The recent discovery of superconductivity at T_{c}=26 K in iron-based LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs (_x_ = 0.05-0.12) (Ref. [1]) has attracted great attention. Following this initial work, more compounds with T_{c} as high as 55 K were synthesized by replacing La with other rare-earth elements such as Sm,^{2-4} Ce,^{5} Nd,^{6} Pr,^{7} and Gd.^{8} Due to their high superconducting transition temperature, which is second only to the high-T_{c} cuprate superconductors, enormous experimental and theoretical efforts have been put on these materials to clarify their phase diagram and superconducting mechanism.

These quaternary rare-earth transition metal arsenide oxides LnOFeAs (Ln=La, Sm, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Gd) form a tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure.^{9} It is believed that the Fe-As layers are responsible for the superconductivity and Ln-O layers provide electron carriers through fluorine doping, or very recently by simply introducing oxygen vacancies.^{10} Neutron scattering experiments have demonstrated that the undoped parent compound LaOFeAs develops long-range spin-density-wave (SDW)-type antiferromagnetic order below 150 K.^{1,11,12} With increasing electron doping by fluorine, the SDW order is suppressed and superconductivity emerges, suggesting competing orders in these systems and similar phase diagram to the one in high-T_{c} cuprates.^{4,13} Theoretically, electron-phonon coupling is not sufficient to explain superconductivity in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs,^{14} while antiferromagnetic interaction^{15-17} and Hund's rule ferromagnetic interaction^{18,19} have been considered as the possible pairing mechanism.

Among the family of LnO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs, specific heat was only studied for LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs compounds so far.^{12,13,20,21} Clear specific heat jump was observed at the temperature about 150 K for LaOFeAs,^{12,13} which is accompanied by anomalies on resistivity, Hall coefficient, and Seebeck coefficient.^{12,13} Since structural transition was also found at 150 K by neutron scattering^{11} and x-ray diffraction,^{22} at present it is unclear whether these resistivity and specific heat anomalies around 150 K are due to the structural or SDW transition, or to both. For superconducting LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1-x}FeAs with T_{c} = 28 K, a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma(H) has been found in the low-temperature limit, which is consistent with the prediction for a nodal superconductor and suggests an unconventional mechanism for this superconductor.^{20} However, it is surprising that no visible specific heat anomaly was detected near T_{c} on the raw data for superconducting LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs samples despite the large Meissner fractions,^{20,21} and only a broadened anomaly of [C(0T)-C(9T)]/T was observed.^{20} This result may reflect the low superfluid density in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. For comparison, precise specific heat measurements on other compounds of this family are highly desired.

Here we systematically study the specific heat of SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs for 0 \leq x \leq 0.2, with the maximum T_{c}(onset)=54 K at x = 0.2. A specific heat jump was observed at 130 K for the undoped x = 0 sample, indicating the structural or SDW transition. However, this jump disappears in x = 0.05 sample. The specific heat C/T shows clear anomaly near T_{c} for x = 0.15 and 0.20 superconducting samples, which has been absent in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. The sharp peak of C(T) appears at 4.6 K for the parent compound SmOFeAs, and it shifts to 3.7 K with doping electrons in the x = 0.15 sample. This specific heat peak should come from the antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm^{3+} ions in this system, as in the electron-doped high-T_{c} cuprate Sm_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}

The polycrystalline samples with nominal composition SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs (_x_ = 0, 0.05, 0.15, and 0.20) are the same ones as studied in Ref. [4], synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction. The x = 0 and 0.05 samples are in single phase. A trace of impurity phases SmOF and SmAs can be observed in x = 0.15 sample, and these impurities are estimated to be less than 10% in the x = 0.20 sample. Specific heat measurements were performed in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS) via the relaxation method and the results are presented per mole of atom (J/mol K). Magnetic field H = 8 T was applied for the x = 0.15 and 0.20 superconducting samples.

The resistivity of this series of SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs samples have been reported previously.^{4} For the x = 0 sample, a rapid resistivity drop below about 130 K was observed. Superconductivity emerges at x = 0.10, and the x = 0.20 sample has the maximum superconducting transition temperature T_{c}(onset) =54 K. The superconducting volume fractions of the x =0.20 sample at 5 K were estimated to be 60% and 30% from the susceptibility measured under zero-field-cool and field-cool conditions at 10 Oe.[4]

Figure 1 shows the specific heat C(T) of SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs samples with x=0 and 0.15. There is a clear specific heat jump close to 130 K for the x=0 sample (enlarged in the inset). A similar jump has been observed in LaOFeAs at 150 K.[1, 2, 3] The specific heat jump at 130 K of the SmOFeAs sample is consistent with the resistivity drop.[4] As in LaOFeAs, the specific heat and resistivity anomalies in SmOFeAs are also attributed to a structural or SDW transition. We note that the phase transition temperature T_{s} in SmOFeAs is about 20 K lower than that in LaOFeAs. The inset of Fig. 1 shows the lack of specific heat jump in the slightly F-doped x=0.05 sample, although there is still a resistivity drop (but less sharp) at about 110 K.[4] This result suggests that electron doping suppresses the magnetic order and structural distortion in SmOFeAs. Indeed, the static antiferromagnetic SDW order and structural transition disappear in the doped superconducting LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs samples, shown by neutron scattering and x-ray diffraction experiments.[11, 22] At low temperature there is a sharp peak for both x=0 (nonsuperconducting) and 0.15 (superconducting) samples, which will be discussed later.

Figure 2(a) plots C/T vs T for the optimally doped SmO_{0.80}F_{0.20}FeAs sample in zero and H=8 T magnetic fields. Below the zero resistivity T_{c}=50 K, one can see a clear specific heat anomaly. Such anomaly has been absent in the LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs superconducting samples with large Meissner fractions.[20, 21] The difference may reflect the higher superfluid density in SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. This is reasonable, since the maximum T_{c} of SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs is twice that of LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs.

Although 8 T is far away from the upper critical field H_{c2} which is higher than 60 T,[23] we nevertheless plot [C(0T)-C(8T)]/T vs T for the x=0.15 and 0.20 samples in Fig. 2(b). The obtained specific heat peak near the zero resistivity T_{c} is sharper than that in the LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1-\delta}FeAs sample.[20]

Below we focus on the low-temperature specific heat behavior of SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs at T<20 K. In Fig. 3(a), C(T) of the x=0 sample shows a very sharp peak at 4.6 K. With electron doping in the x=0.15 superconducting sample, the peak shifts to 3.7 K and its height decreases. This low-temperature peak has not been seen in previous specific heat studies of LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs.[21, 13, 20, 22] Since the only difference between these two materials is the Ln^{3+} ions, i.e., nonmagnetic La^{3+} and magnetic Sm^{3+} ions, this peak may relate to the magnetic ordering of Sm^{3+} ions. In fact, exactly the same specific heat behavior at low temperature has been observed in electron-doped high-T_{c} cuprate Sm_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}.[24, 25] Antiferromagnetic ordering of the Sm^{3+} ions was found in Sm_{2}CuO_{4} at T_{N}=5.9 K, accompanied by a sharp specific heat peak.[24] By substituting electron donor element Ce^{4+} for Sm^{3+} ions, the ordering temperature T_{N} is lowered to 4.7 K in Sm_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} with T_{c}=16.5 K.[25] Therefore the sharp specific heat peak below 5 K in SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs manifests the antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm^{3+} ions. Below T_{N}, the superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetism, as in Sm_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}.

Due to this antiferromagnetic specific heat peak, it is not

The arrow marks zero resistivity T_{c}=50 K. (b) [C(0T)-C(8T)]/T vs T for the x=0.15 and 0.20 samples. One can see a clear specific heat peak near the zero resistivity T_{c} for both samples.

For the x=0 parent compound, clear specific heat jump can be seen at 130 K, denoted as the structural or SDW transition temperature T_{s}. The inset shows the lack of such jump in the slightly F-doped x=0.05 sample.

  easy to extrapolate the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma in the low-temperature limit. In Fig. 3(b), C/T vs T^{2} is plotted for the x=0.15 sample in H=0 and 8 T. The data between 14 and 20 K can be linearly fitted by C/T= \gamma+ \beta T^{2}, which give \gamma=81.0 and 83.7 mJ/mol K^{2} for H=0 and 8 T, respectively. This value of \gamma is much higher than that obtained in LaO_{0.89}F_{0.11}FeAs (T_{c}=28 K), \gamma=1.0 mJ/mol K^{2} (Ref. [21]). For Sm18.5CeO_{0.15}CuO_{4-\beta} with T_{c}=16.5 K, the fitting also gave exceptionally large \gamma=103.2 mJ/mol K^{2} (Ref. [25]). It was speculated that the effects of magnetic correlation exist well above T_{N}, thereby making accurate determination of \gamma difficult. In addition, since the fitting in Fig. 3(b) was done at relatively high temperature and over a small range from 14 to 20 K, the slope \beta may not represent the phonon specific heat in the low-temperature limit, where it is proportional to T^{3}. Therefore the resulting large \gamma may not be reliable. In Fig. 3(b), \gamma only increases very slightly in H=8 T and we are unable to examine its field dependence for the SmO_{0.85}F_{0.15}FeAs sample. For superconducting LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs, there is no such antiferromagnetic specific heat peak and the data were fitted at low temperature, thus the extrapolated \gamma\sim 1.0 mJ/mol K^{2} is more reliable and shows a steep increase with increasing magnetic field.[20, 21]

Figure 4 plots the magnetic specific heat of SmOFeAs, C_{m}=C-\gamma T-\beta T^{3}, with \gamma=119.4 mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta =0.56 mJ/mol K^{4} obtained from the same fitting process as in Fig. 3(b). The magnetic entropy S associated with the magnetic transition is also calculated from the C_{m}(T) and shown in the inset of Fig. 4. With increasing temperature, the entropy rapidly increases and then saturates to the value of R\ln 2 within experimental error, indicating that the Sm3* ground state in the crystal field is a doublet for SmOFeAs. In summary, we have systematically studied the specific heat of the iron-based high-T_{c} superconductor SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. First, a specific heat jump was observed at 130 K for the undoped x=0 sample, corresponding to the structural or SDW transition. However, this jump disappears in the slightly F-doped x=0.05 sample, indicating the suppression of the SDW order and structural distortion by electron doping in this system. Second, a clear specific heat anomaly can be seen near T_{c} for superconducting SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs samples, while it has been absent in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. This result suggests higher superfluid density in SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. Finally, sharp specific heat peak shows up at 4.6 K for the x=0 sample, and it shifts to 3.7 K upon electron doping in the x=0.15 sample. By comparing with the electron-doped high-T_{c} cuprate Sm_{2-x}Ce,CuO_{4-\phi} this sharp peak is attributed to the antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm^{3+} ions in the SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs system.

Indeed, the static antiferromagnetic SDW order and structural transition disappear in the doped superconducting LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs samples, shown by neutron scattering and x-ray diffraction experiments.[11, 22] At low temperature there is a sharp peak for both x=0 (nonsuperconducting) and 0.15 (superconducting) samples, which will be discussed later.

Figure 2(a) plots C/T vs T for the optimally doped SmO_{0.80}F_{0.20}FeAs sample in zero and H=8 T magnetic fields. Below the zero resistivity T_{c}=50 K, one can see a clear specific heat anomaly. Such anomaly has been absent in the LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs superconducting samples with large Meissner fractions.[20, 21] The difference may reflect the higher superfluid density in SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. This is reasonable, since the maximum T_{c} of SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs is twice that of LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs.

Although 8 T is far away from the upper critical field H_{c2} which is higher than 60 T,[23] we nevertheless plot [C(0T)-C(8T)]/T vs T for the x=0.15 and 0.20 samples in Fig. 2(b). The obtained specific heat peak near the zero resistivity T_{c} is sharper than that in the LaO_{0.9}F_{0.1-\delta}FeAs sample.[20]

Below we focus on the low-temperature specific heat behavior of SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs at T<20 K. In Fig. 3(a), C(T) of the x=0 sample shows a very sharp peak at 4.6 K. With electron doping in the x=0.15 superconducting sample, the peak shifts to 3.7 K and its height decreases. This low-temperature peak has not been seen in previous specific heat studies of LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs.[21, 13, 20, 22] Since the only difference between these two materials is the Ln^{3+} ions, i.e., nonmagnetic La^{3+} and magnetic Sm^{3+} ions, this peak may relate to the magnetic ordering of Sm^{3+} ions. In fact, exactly the same specific heat behavior at low temperature has been observed in electron-doped high-T_{c} cuprate Sm_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}.[24, 25] Antiferromagnetic ordering of the Sm^{3+} ions was found in Sm_{2}CuO_{4} at T_{N}=5.9 K, accompanied by a sharp specific heat peak.[24] By substituting electron donor element Ce^{4+} for Sm^{3+} ions, the ordering temperature T_{N} is lowered to 4.7 K in Sm_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_{4-\delta} with T_{c}=16.5 K.[25] Therefore the sharp specific heat peak below 5 K in SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs manifests the antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm^{3+} ions. Below T_{N}, the superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetism, as in Sm_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4-\delta}.

Due to this antiferromagnetic specific heat peak, it is not

The arrow marks zero resistivity T_{c}=50 K. (b) [C(0T)-C(8T)]/T vs T for the x=0.15 and 0.20 samples. One can see a clear specific heat peak near the zero resistivity T_{c} for both samples.

For the x=0 parent compound, clear specific heat jump can be seen at 130 K, denoted as the structural or SDW transition temperature T_{s}. The inset shows the lack of such jump in the slightly F-doped x=0.05 sample.

  easy to extrapolate the electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma in the low-temperature limit. In Fig. 3(b), C/T vs T^{2} is plotted for the x=0.15 sample in H=0 and 8 T. The data between 14 and 20 K can be linearly fitted by C/T= \gamma+ \beta T^{2}, which give \gamma=81.0 and 83.7 mJ/mol K^{2} for H=0 and 8 T, respectively. This value of \gamma is much higher than that obtained in LaO_{0.89}F_{0.11}FeAs (T_{c}=28 K), \gamma=1.0 mJ/mol K^{2} (Ref. [21]). For Sm18.5CeO_{0.15}CuO_{4-\beta} with T_{c}=16.5 K, the fitting also gave exceptionally large \gamma=103.2 mJ/mol K^{2} (Ref. [25]). It was speculated that the effects of magnetic correlation exist well above T_{N}, thereby making accurate determination of \gamma difficult. In addition, since the fitting in Fig. 3(b) was done at relatively high temperature and over a small range from 14 to 20 K, the slope \beta may not represent the phonon specific heat in the low-temperature limit, where it is proportional to T^{3}. Therefore the resulting large \gamma may not be reliable. In Fig. 3(b), \gamma only increases very slightly in H=8 T and we are unable to examine its field dependence for the SmO_{0.85}F_{0.15}FeAs sample. For superconducting LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs, there is no such antiferromagnetic specific heat peak and the data were fitted at low temperature, thus the extrapolated \gamma\sim 1.0 mJ/mol K^{2} is more reliable and shows a steep increase with increasing magnetic field.[20, 21]

Figure 4 plots the magnetic specific heat of SmOFeAs, C_{m}=C-\gamma T-\beta T^{3}, with \gamma=119.4 mJ/mol K^{2} and \beta =0.56 mJ/mol K^{4} obtained from the same fitting process as in Fig. 3(b). The magnetic entropy S associated with the magnetic transition is also calculated from the C_{m}(T) and shown in the inset of Fig. 4. With increasing temperature, the entropy rapidly increases and then saturates to the value of R\ln 2 within experimental error, indicating that the Sm3* ground state in the crystal field is a doublet for SmOFeAs. In summary, we have systematically studied the specific heat of the iron-based high-T_{c} superconductor SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. First, a specific heat jump was observed at 130 K for the undoped x=0 sample, corresponding to the structural or SDW transition. However, this jump disappears in the slightly F-doped x=0.05 sample, indicating the suppression of the SDW order and structural distortion by electron doping in this system. Second, a clear specific heat anomaly can be seen near T_{c} for superconducting SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs samples, while it has been absent in LaO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. This result suggests higher superfluid density in SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs. Finally, sharp specific heat peak shows up at 4.6 K for the x=0 sample, and it shifts to 3.7 K upon electron doping in the x=0.15 sample. By comparing with the electron-doped high-T_{c} cuprate Sm_{2-x}Ce,CuO_{4-\phi} this sharp peak is attributed to the antiferromagnetic ordering of Sm^{3+} ions in the SmO_{1-x}F_{x}FeAs system.
