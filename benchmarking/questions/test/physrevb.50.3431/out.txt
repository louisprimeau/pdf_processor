###### Abstract

The structural and electrical properties of Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_PrxCu2O8+8 have been investigated as a function of x. Powder-x-ray-diffraction patterns indicate that this system forms a continuous solid solution. It is found that phase separation exits in this system. Two phases with different modulated periods appear as the Pr doping changes. At low doping levels, the short-period phase dominates, while at high doping levels the long-period phase dominates. The short-period phase and the long-period phase are thought to correspond to the poor-Pr- and rich-Pr-concentration phases, respectively. T_{c} was found to increase slightly for x <= 0.1, decrease linearly for 0.1 <= x <= 0.4, then to be depressed rapidly for 0.4 <= x <= 0.5, and finally to disappear at x = 0.6. The valence of Pr was inferred to be close to +3 from the measurement of the oxygen content and the comparison with other rare-earth-doped Bi-2212 systems. The variation of T_{c} was explained in terms of hole filling and phase separation.

It is known that substitution of most trivalent rare earths on the Y site in YBa2Cu3O7-8 (Y-123) does not dramatically affect superconductivity. The variations in T_{c} are typically 1 - 2 K.1 One exception to this behavior is Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-8, where T_{c} is depressed rapidly with increasing x and T_{c} - 0 for _x_cr 0.55.2-4 Moreover, unlike other _R_Ba2Cu3O7-8 compounds (_R_ stands for trivalent rare earths), PrBa2Cu3O7-8 is a semiconductor though it possesses an identical orthorhombic structure with YBa2Cu3O7-8. This anomalous behavior of Pr has aroused much interest in studying Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-8 intensively to clarify the mechanism responsible for the nonsuperconductivity of PrBa2Cu3O7-8.

The valence of Pr ions inferred from magnetic measurement,5 Hall effect,6 neutron diffraction,7 and other studies8,9 is greater than +3 and possibly close to +4, implying the depression of T_{c} as a result of hole filling in the CuO2 sheets. On the other hand, spectroscopic measurements10-12 suggest that there is substantial hybridization between the 4f electrons on the Pr site and the 2_p_-3d holes within the CuO2 sheets. This hybridization may cause the electron (hole) pairs to break or to be localized, accounting for at least a portion of the depression of T_{c} with doping of Pr. Our recent studies13 on Pr0.2Yb0.8-_x_La_Ba2Cu3O7-8 support this argument. It has been found that the larger the radius of the rare earth R 3+, the lower the required Pr3+ concentration, or rather the lower the critical concentration _x_cr at which the T_{c} of R1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-8 is depressed to zero. A linear correlation between the critical concentration of Pr and the radius of the rare earths has been found to exist.13,14

The Ca site in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+8 (Bi-2212) has an identical crystallographic environment of the R site in _R_-123, both occupying the center of Cu-O octahedra. Experiments have indicated that R can substitute for Ca in Bi2212 and the doped structure does not change fundamentally. R doping studies of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+8 have been extensively carried out. T_{c} was found to decrease with increasing R 3+ with the critical concentration _x_cr = 0.4-0.6.15-22 The critical concentration for Ce doping is about half that of other trivalent rare earths.22,23 Similar results were also found in Bi2Sr2-_x_R_xCau2O8+8 (_R_ = Nd and Ce).24 The filling of a 3d hole by an extra electron and the decrease of carriers in the CuO2 sheets have been implicated in the depression of T_{c} with R doping19,21,24 in these systems. No significant magnetic pair breaking was observed in the Pr- and Gd-doped systems. In addition, a dimensional changeover from two to three dimensions was observed in variable-range hoping in the Pr-,22 Ce-,22, Eu-,20 Dy-,20 and Tm-doped20 Bi-2212 systems.

In this paper, we report our results of a systematic study of the properties of Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr_xCu2O8+8 as a function of x. The structural features and electrical properties were analyzed within the framework of current understanding of Pr-doped Bi-2212.

BiSr2Ca1-_x_Pr2CaO8+-_δ_ samples with x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 were prepared by solid-state reaction of appropriate mixtures of high-purity Pr6O11, Bi2O3, SrCO3, CaCO3, and CuO. The powders were mixed, ground, and fired at 800 degC for 12 h in air. Two or three additional firings for 24-h intervals with intermediate grinding were performed before the samples were pressed into pellets. The pellets were then calcined at 840-950 degC with increasing Pr doping levels.

Phase identification and measurement of lattice parameters were performed on a Rigaku automatic diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation at room temperature. High-purity Si was added to the samples as an internal standard to correct the positions of the diffraction lines. The lattice parameters were then calculated using a standard least-squares method.

The electrical resistivity vs temperature was measured on rectangular bars cut from the sintered pellets employing the standard dc four-probe technique with silver paint contacts attached to the electric leads. Data were collected from 300 down to 4.3 K.

Powder-x-ray-diffraction patterns indicated that all samples are single phase and Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr2Cu2O8+-_δ_ forms a continuous solid solution over the entire compositional range of x. As an example, shown in Fig. 1 is the diffraction pattern for the sample with x = 0.6 and its indexed results. It has been reported that pure and Pr-doped Bi-2212 possess an orthorhombic structure with space group _Fmmm_ or _Amaa_.22,25-27 Here we adopt _Fmmm_ with lattice parameters a  b since the difference between a and b is so small that it is difficult to discern the split of the related diffraction lines in the powder-diffraction patterns. The variation of lattice parameters with x is depicted in Fig. 2. The c parameter decreases monotonically with x, while the a parameter slightly increases with x. The shrinkage in c can be attributed to the increase in oxygen content due to trivalent or tetravalent Pr ion substitution for divalent eight-coordinated Ca. The slight expansion in a suggests that the CuO2 sheets accept electrons and consequently hole filling occurs. The hole concentration has been found to decrease with increased doping level of Pr in this system.17

In order to understand the details of the variation of the lattice parameters, we measured the oxygen content for all samples by iodometric titration. Spectral-purity CuO was used as a standard to correct the concentration of Na2S2O3*5H2O. The measurement error is estimated to be less than 0.3%. Figure 3 shows the variation of oxygen content vs x for Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr2Cu2O8+-_δ_. The oxygen content n increases almost linearly with x, the doping level of Pr. Fitting n vs x yields the equation n = 8.19+0.34x, where 8.19 corresponds to the oxygen content for pure Bi-2212, and 0.34 is the slope of the line. The line slope, 0.34, is less than 0.5, half of the difference of valence between Pr3+ and Ca2+ (assuming the valence of Pr is +3). This means that the structure cannot accommodate enough oxygen to neutralize the extra elec

  trons introduced by the substitution. The remaining electrons will bring about the reduction of Cu in the CuO_{2} sheets. In the present case, 0.32 [=2(0.5 - 0.34)] Cu2+ ions will be reduced by the substitution of one Pr ion for one Ca ion. This value is approximately equal to that (0.34) for Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_x_Cu2O8+.2. It is, therefore, reasonable to infer that the valence of Pr in Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr_Cu2O8+ is close to +3 and the hole filling should be responsible, at least partially, for the depression of T_{c} in this system.

Shown in Fig. 4 are the variations of T_{c} vs x for Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr_Cu2O8+, where T_{c} is defined as the temperature at which the resistivity corresponds to 50% of the extrapolated normal-state value, while the transition width indicated by vertical bars is defined as the temperature difference between the 90% and 10% values. T_{c} slightly increases with x <= 0.1, reaches maximum value at x = 0.1, and decreases almost linearly for 0.1 <= x <= 0.4. Then there is an abrupt decrease in T_{c} for 0.4 <= x <= 0.5. Superconductivity finally disappears for x <= 0.6. On the other hand, the T_{c}(onset) remains almost unchanged for 0 <= x <= 0.4, while T_{c}(0) decreases with x in the same compositional region. Both T_{c}(onset) and T_{c}(0) have a dramatic drop for 0.4 <= x <= 0.5. Olivier _et al._29 found similar variations of T_{c}(onset) and T_{c}(0) in Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_x_Cu2O8+. They thought that abrupt drops of T_{c} resulted from the existence of a composition-al range of Y in samples at certain doping level of Y.

One striking feature in Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr_x_Cu2O8+ shown by this study is the appearance of phase separation as the doping of Pr increases. Figures 5(a)-5(d) are electron-diffraction patterns taken for compounds with x = 0.2, 0.6, and 1.0. All electron incidences parallel to the c axis. Superlattice spots showing a one-dimensional modulated structure as well as fundamental spots are observed for all samples. The period for the compound with x = 0 has been reported to be 4.8b.30,31 In this study, a modulated period for x = 0.2 is determined to be 4.5b. As the doping level increases, this period decreases to 4.3b at x = 0.6 and disappears at x = 1.0. Meanwhile, another period of 8.5b appears at x = 0.6 and decreases to 8.0b for x = 1.0. A period of 8.3b is observed to exist predominantly at x = 0.8. Inoue _et al._31 also found a long modulated period 8b - 10b in the Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_x_Cu2O8+ system. Considering that the volume of two structures with different periods varies in an opposite way with Pr doping, we have reason to think that these two periods correspond to two phases with different Pr concentration. At low doping levels, the short period dominates, while at high levels, the long period dominates. For the intermediate doping levels, the two periods coexist equally. This is understood to relate to the variations of T_{c} vs doping of Pr, where T_{c}(onset) is essentially unchanged and T_{c}(0) decreases for 0.0 <= x <= 0.4. Hence the short-period phase corresponds to the Pr-poor phase, which possesses high _T__c_; and the long-period phase corresponds to the Pr-rich phase, which possesses low T_{c}. The wide transitions of T_{c} suggest intergrowth of these two phases in grains. The abrupt change of T_{c} for 0.4 <= x <= 0.5 suggests that the

  grains of the short-period phase may be poorly connected with each other and electrical transportation is controlled by the long-period phase.

In conclusion, studies of the structural and electrical properties and oxygen content of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system indicate that the mechanism responsible for depression of T_{c} is mainly hole filling, not magnetic pair breaking. There exists phase separation of two phases with different modulated periods in the presently studied system, which is thought to have effects on the electrical properties.

###### Abstract

The structural and electrical properties of Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_PrxCu2O8+8 have been investigated as a function of x. Powder-x-ray-diffraction patterns indicate that this system forms a continuous solid solution. It is found that phase separation exits in this system. Two phases with different modulated periods appear as the Pr doping changes. At low doping levels, the short-period phase dominates, while at high doping levels the long-period phase dominates. The short-period phase and the long-period phase are thought to correspond to the poor-Pr- and rich-Pr-concentration phases, respectively. T_{c} was found to increase slightly for x <= 0.1, decrease linearly for 0.1 <= x <= 0.4, then to be depressed rapidly for 0.4 <= x <= 0.5, and finally to disappear at x = 0.6. The valence of Pr was inferred to be close to +3 from the measurement of the oxygen content and the comparison with other rare-earth-doped Bi-2212 systems. The variation of T_{c} was explained in terms of hole filling and phase separation.

It is known that substitution of most trivalent rare earths on the Y site in YBa2Cu3O7-8 (Y-123) does not dramatically affect superconductivity. The variations in T_{c} are typically 1 - 2 K.1 One exception to this behavior is Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-8, where T_{c} is depressed rapidly with increasing x and T_{c} - 0 for _x_cr 0.55.2-4 Moreover, unlike other _R_Ba2Cu3O7-8 compounds (_R_ stands for trivalent rare earths), PrBa2Cu3O7-8 is a semiconductor though it possesses an identical orthorhombic structure with YBa2Cu3O7-8. This anomalous behavior of Pr has aroused much interest in studying Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-8 intensively to clarify the mechanism responsible for the nonsuperconductivity of PrBa2Cu3O7-8.

The valence of Pr ions inferred from magnetic measurement,5 Hall effect,6 neutron diffraction,7 and other studies8,9 is greater than +3 and possibly close to +4, implying the depression of T_{c} as a result of hole filling in the CuO2 sheets. On the other hand, spectroscopic measurements10-12 suggest that there is substantial hybridization between the 4f electrons on the Pr site and the 2_p_-3d holes within the CuO2 sheets. This hybridization may cause the electron (hole) pairs to break or to be localized, accounting for at least a portion of the depression of T_{c} with doping of Pr. Our recent studies13 on Pr0.2Yb0.8-_x_La_Ba2Cu3O7-8 support this argument. It has been found that the larger the radius of the rare earth R 3+, the lower the required Pr3+ concentration, or rather the lower the critical concentration _x_cr at which the T_{c} of R1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-8 is depressed to zero. A linear correlation between the critical concentration of Pr and the radius of the rare earths has been found to exist.13,14

The Ca site in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+8 (Bi-2212) has an identical crystallographic environment of the R site in _R_-123, both occupying the center of Cu-O octahedra. Experiments have indicated that R can substitute for Ca in Bi2212 and the doped structure does not change fundamentally. R doping studies of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+8 have been extensively carried out. T_{c} was found to decrease with increasing R 3+ with the critical concentration _x_cr = 0.4-0.6.15-22 The critical concentration for Ce doping is about half that of other trivalent rare earths.22,23 Similar results were also found in Bi2Sr2-_x_R_xCau2O8+8 (_R_ = Nd and Ce).24 The filling of a 3d hole by an extra electron and the decrease of carriers in the CuO2 sheets have been implicated in the depression of T_{c} with R doping19,21,24 in these systems. No significant magnetic pair breaking was observed in the Pr- and Gd-doped systems. In addition, a dimensional changeover from two to three dimensions was observed in variable-range hoping in the Pr-,22 Ce-,22, Eu-,20 Dy-,20 and Tm-doped20 Bi-2212 systems.

In this paper, we report our results of a systematic study of the properties of Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr_xCu2O8+8 as a function of x. The structural features and electrical properties were analyzed within the framework of current understanding of Pr-doped Bi-2212.

BiSr2Ca1-_x_Pr2CaO8+-_δ_ samples with x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 were prepared by solid-state reaction of appropriate mixtures of high-purity Pr6O11, Bi2O3, SrCO3, CaCO3, and CuO. The powders were mixed, ground, and fired at 800 degC for 12 h in air. Two or three additional firings for 24-h intervals with intermediate grinding were performed before the samples were pressed into pellets. The pellets were then calcined at 840-950 degC with increasing Pr doping levels.

Phase identification and measurement of lattice parameters were performed on a Rigaku automatic diffractometer using Cu _K_a radiation at room temperature. High-purity Si was added to the samples as an internal standard to correct the positions of the diffraction lines. The lattice parameters were then calculated using a standard least-squares method.

The electrical resistivity vs temperature was measured on rectangular bars cut from the sintered pellets employing the standard dc four-probe technique with silver paint contacts attached to the electric leads. Data were collected from 300 down to 4.3 K.

Powder-x-ray-diffraction patterns indicated that all samples are single phase and Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr2Cu2O8+-_δ_ forms a continuous solid solution over the entire compositional range of x. As an example, shown in Fig. 1 is the diffraction pattern for the sample with x = 0.6 and its indexed results. It has been reported that pure and Pr-doped Bi-2212 possess an orthorhombic structure with space group _Fmmm_ or _Amaa_.22,25-27 Here we adopt _Fmmm_ with lattice parameters a  b since the difference between a and b is so small that it is difficult to discern the split of the related diffraction lines in the powder-diffraction patterns. The variation of lattice parameters with x is depicted in Fig. 2. The c parameter decreases monotonically with x, while the a parameter slightly increases with x. The shrinkage in c can be attributed to the increase in oxygen content due to trivalent or tetravalent Pr ion substitution for divalent eight-coordinated Ca. The slight expansion in a suggests that the CuO2 sheets accept electrons and consequently hole filling occurs. The hole concentration has been found to decrease with increased doping level of Pr in this system.17

In order to understand the details of the variation of the lattice parameters, we measured the oxygen content for all samples by iodometric titration. Spectral-purity CuO was used as a standard to correct the concentration of Na2S2O3*5H2O. The measurement error is estimated to be less than 0.3%. Figure 3 shows the variation of oxygen content vs x for Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr2Cu2O8+-_δ_. The oxygen content n increases almost linearly with x, the doping level of Pr. Fitting n vs x yields the equation n = 8.19+0.34x, where 8.19 corresponds to the oxygen content for pure Bi-2212, and 0.34 is the slope of the line. The line slope, 0.34, is less than 0.5, half of the difference of valence between Pr3+ and Ca2+ (assuming the valence of Pr is +3). This means that the structure cannot accommodate enough oxygen to neutralize the extra elec

  trons introduced by the substitution. The remaining electrons will bring about the reduction of Cu in the CuO_{2} sheets. In the present case, 0.32 [=2(0.5 - 0.34)] Cu2+ ions will be reduced by the substitution of one Pr ion for one Ca ion. This value is approximately equal to that (0.34) for Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_x_Cu2O8+.2. It is, therefore, reasonable to infer that the valence of Pr in Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr_Cu2O8+ is close to +3 and the hole filling should be responsible, at least partially, for the depression of T_{c} in this system.

Shown in Fig. 4 are the variations of T_{c} vs x for Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr_Cu2O8+, where T_{c} is defined as the temperature at which the resistivity corresponds to 50% of the extrapolated normal-state value, while the transition width indicated by vertical bars is defined as the temperature difference between the 90% and 10% values. T_{c} slightly increases with x <= 0.1, reaches maximum value at x = 0.1, and decreases almost linearly for 0.1 <= x <= 0.4. Then there is an abrupt decrease in T_{c} for 0.4 <= x <= 0.5. Superconductivity finally disappears for x <= 0.6. On the other hand, the T_{c}(onset) remains almost unchanged for 0 <= x <= 0.4, while T_{c}(0) decreases with x in the same compositional region. Both T_{c}(onset) and T_{c}(0) have a dramatic drop for 0.4 <= x <= 0.5. Olivier _et al._29 found similar variations of T_{c}(onset) and T_{c}(0) in Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_x_Cu2O8+. They thought that abrupt drops of T_{c} resulted from the existence of a composition-al range of Y in samples at certain doping level of Y.

One striking feature in Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Pr_x_Cu2O8+ shown by this study is the appearance of phase separation as the doping of Pr increases. Figures 5(a)-5(d) are electron-diffraction patterns taken for compounds with x = 0.2, 0.6, and 1.0. All electron incidences parallel to the c axis. Superlattice spots showing a one-dimensional modulated structure as well as fundamental spots are observed for all samples. The period for the compound with x = 0 has been reported to be 4.8b.30,31 In this study, a modulated period for x = 0.2 is determined to be 4.5b. As the doping level increases, this period decreases to 4.3b at x = 0.6 and disappears at x = 1.0. Meanwhile, another period of 8.5b appears at x = 0.6 and decreases to 8.0b for x = 1.0. A period of 8.3b is observed to exist predominantly at x = 0.8. Inoue _et al._31 also found a long modulated period 8b - 10b in the Bi2Sr2Ca1-_x_Y_x_Cu2O8+ system. Considering that the volume of two structures with different periods varies in an opposite way with Pr doping, we have reason to think that these two periods correspond to two phases with different Pr concentration. At low doping levels, the short period dominates, while at high levels, the long period dominates. For the intermediate doping levels, the two periods coexist equally. This is understood to relate to the variations of T_{c} vs doping of Pr, where T_{c}(onset) is essentially unchanged and T_{c}(0) decreases for 0.0 <= x <= 0.4. Hence the short-period phase corresponds to the Pr-poor phase, which possesses high _T__c_; and the long-period phase corresponds to the Pr-rich phase, which possesses low T_{c}. The wide transitions of T_{c} suggest intergrowth of these two phases in grains. The abrupt change of T_{c} for 0.4 <= x <= 0.5 suggests that the

Figure 4: Variation of T_{c} vs dopant concentration of Pr in Bi2Sr2Ca1−_x_Pr_Cu2O8+, where T_{c} is defined as the temperature at which the resistivity corresponds to 50% of the extrapolated normal-state value, while the transition width indicated by vertical bars is defined as the temperature difference between the 90% and 10% values.

  grains of the short-period phase may be poorly connected with each other and electrical transportation is controlled by the long-period phase.

In conclusion, studies of the structural and electrical properties and oxygen content of the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{1-x}Pr_{x}Cu_{2}O_{8+\delta} system indicate that the mechanism responsible for depression of T_{c} is mainly hole filling, not magnetic pair breaking. There exists phase separation of two phases with different modulated periods in the presently studied system, which is thought to have effects on the electrical properties.
