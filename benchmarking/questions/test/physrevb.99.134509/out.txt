###### Abstract

The noncentrosymmetric superconductor BeAu has been investigated using magnetization, resistivity, specific heat, and muon-spin relaxation/rotation. BeAu crystallizes in a cubic FeSi-type B2O structure with a superconducting transition temperature T_{c}=3.2\pm 0.1 K. The low-temperature specific heat data, Ce_{4}(T), indicates a weakly-coupled fully gapped BCS superconductivity with an isotropic energy gap 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=3.76, close to the BCS value of 3.52. Interestingly, type-I superconductivity is inferred from the \muSR measurements, in contrast to the earlier reports of type-II superconductivity in BeAu. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter is \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.4<1/\sqrt{2}. The frequency domain transverse-field \muSR spectra, depicting the internal magnetic field probability distribution, P(B), also confirms the absence of the mixed state in BeAu. The thermodynamic critical field, H_{c}, is calculated to be around 259 Oe. The zero-field \muSR results indicate that time-reversal symmetry is preserved and supports a spin-singlet pairing in the superconducting ground state.

## I Introduction

Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) superconductors (SCs) that lack an inversion symmetry in the crystal structure display a variety of unusual properties in the superconducting state [1]. In superconductors with conserved inversion symmetry, the Cooper-pair wave function is strictly determined by the parity symmetry. This means that the pair wave function consists of familiar odd and even parity labels of spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pairs [2]. However, for NCS SCs the conventional Cooper pairs can no longer form. The lack of inversion symmetry in NCS SCs gives rise to an asymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) which causes the splitting of the Fermi surface [1]. This splitting allows for a mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing [1,3-5]. Mixed-parity superconductivity can lead to various exotic unconventional superconducting properties [3-7].

Evidence of unconventional superconductivity has been observed in several NCS SCs, for example: CePt_{3}Si [8], Li_{2}Pt_{3}B [9,10], and CeIrSi_{3}[11] exhibit lines nodes in the superconducting gap, whereas LaNiC_{2}[12] and (La,Y)_{2}C_{3}[13] show multigap superconductivity. An unusually high upper critical field, compared to the Pauli paramagnetic limiting field, has been observed in CePtSi [14] and Ce(Rh,Ir)Si_{3}[15,16] due to the influence of strong ASOC. Furthermore, \muSR measurements have found time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in LaNiC_{2}[17], Re_{6}(Ti,Zr,Hf) [18-20], La_{7}Ir_{3}[21], and SrPtAs [22]. However, other systems such as: BiPd [23,24], Nb_{0.18}Re_{0.82}[25], LaMSi_{3} (M = Rh, Ir) [26,27], LaMSi_{3} (M = Pd, Pt) [28], T_{2}Ga_{9} (T = Rh, Ir) [29,30] appear to behave as conventional s-wave fully-gapped superconductors. These varied properties make it valuable to study additional noncentrosymmetric systems to gain a deeper understanding of their physics.

Recently, the physical properties of NCS superconductor BeAu with superconducting transition temperature T_{c}=3.3 K were reported by Amon _et al._[31]. The discovery of superconductivity in BeAu was first reported by B. T. Matthias in the early 1960s [32]. However, no comment was made regarding the nature of superconductivity and noncentrosymmetry in this material. BeAu undergoes a structural phase transition at T_{s}=80 K, where it transforms from a high-temperature CsCl structure to a low-temperature FeSi structure. In the low-temperature phase (FeSi structure) Au atoms are surrounded by seven Be atoms and six Au atoms whereas in high-temperature phase (CsCl structure) Au atoms are coordinated by eight Be atoms and six Au atoms [31]. It is the cubic FeSi-type B2O structure which is noncentrosymmetric and thoroughly investigated in this work. Previously investigated superconducting properties of BeAu suggest a weakly coupled type-II superconductivity with a reported lower and upper critical field of 32 Oe and 335 Oe, respectively [31]. However, the physical properties were inadequate to define the class of superconductivity entirely. Therefore, it warrants an in-depth analysis of the superconducting state of BeAu using the muon spin rotation/relaxation (\muSR) measurements. This method has been proven to be successful in determining the probability distribution of the internal fields, which subsequently can provide various types of information on the SC state.

In this paper, we have investigated the superconducting properties of BeAu using resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and \muSR measurements. The transverse-field (TF)-\muSR asymmetry spectra were transformed into a probability field distribution using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm [33] to observe the dominant field components. The TF-\muSR spectra in the time domain were analyzed using a sum of Gaussian field distributions to quantify the different magnetic field distribution present in the sample as a function of temperature and field. Also, the zero-field (ZF)-_m_SR measurements were employed to search for TRS breaking phenomena in the material. Interestingly, our results suggest that BeAu can be classified as a weakly-coupled type-I superconductor with a thermodynamic critical field H_{c}\simeq 259\pm 1 Oe in contrast with the earlier reports [31]. The Ginzburg -Landau parameter _k_OL obtained is around 0.4<1/\sqrt{2} again confirming type-I superconductivity in the system.

## II II. Experimental methods

The polycrystalline sample of BeAu was prepared by arc melting a stoichiometric mixture of elements Au (5N, Alfa Aesar) and Be (5N, Alfa Aesar) on a water-cooled copper hearth under a high purity argon gas atmosphere. The sample was melted several times sequentially without removal from the inert gas atmosphere. The mass loss (<2%) was confirmed after melting, and a small amount of beryllium was added to compensate for the Be loss. The as-cast sample was then sealed in the evacuated quartz tubes and annealed at 500 ^{\circ}C for 48 h.

Room temperature powder x-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a PANalytical diffractometer (Cu K_a_1 radiation, l = 1.54056 A). Temperature and field dependent magnetization data were collected using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID MPMS 3, Quantum Design). The measurements were performed in the temperature range of 1.8 K to 4.0 K with applied magnetic fields up to 300 Oe. The electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements were performed on a physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design, Inc.).

The _m_SR measurements were carried out using the MUSR spectrometer at the ISIS Neutron and Muon facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, United Kingdom. The powdered BeAu sample was mounted on a high-purity-silver plate using diluted GE varnish. The measurements were performed under zero-field and transverse-field conditions in the temperature range 0.1-3.5 K using a sorption He3 cryostat. A full description of the _m_SR technique may be found in Ref. [34]. In ZF-_m_SR, the contribution from the stray fields at the sample position due to neighboring instruments and the Earth's magnetic field is canceled to within ~1.0 _m_T by using three sets of orthogonal coils. TF-_m_SR measurements are performed to investigate the magnetic field distribution inside the sample. The TF-_m_SR data were analyzed using the MaxEnt technique to determine the probability distribution, P(B), of the internal magnetic fields. Applied fields between 50 Oe and 300 Oe were used to fully discover the superconducting phase diagram of BeAu.

## III III. Results and discussion

### A. Structural details

Figure 1 shows the room temperature powder x-ray diffraction pattern for BeAu. The refinement shows that our sample crystallizes into a single phase of the expected noncentrosymmetric cubic FeSi-type structure with the unit cell parameter a=4.6684(3) A. Small impurity phase is observed in the XRD pattern. However, no significant effect of this impurity phase is observed in the bulk and muon spectroscopy measurements. These results are in good agreement with the published literature [31].

### B. Electrical resistivity

Electrical resistivity r versus temperature T data for BeAu was measured in zero applied magnetic field within the temperature range 1.8 K <= T <= 300 K, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The metallic nature of the sample can be inferred from the T dependence of r, where resistivity decreases consistently with decreasing temperature. At T = 300 K, the value of the resistivity is _r_(300 K) <= 112 _m_DR cm and the resistivity at T = 4 K is _r_(4 K) <= 1.35 _m_DR cm, giving a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) <=83. The low value of residual resistivity just above the superconducting state along with the high value of RRR reflects the good quality of our sample. The inset of Fig. 2(a) highlights the sharp drop to zero resistance below _T_const = 3.25 K, signaling the onset of superconductivity in BeAu. The zero resistivity value is reached at _T_c = 3.15 K. Transition temperature _T_c, defined as the midpoint of the transition, is 3.2 +- 0.1 K, close to the previously published value [31, 35]. The _r_(_T_) measurements were performed at various applied magnetic fields between 0 Oe <= H <= 200 Oe as shown in Fig. 2(b). The application of the magnetic field suppresses T_c_ rapidly; at H = 200 Oe, T_c_ decreases below 1.8 K from 3.17 K at H = 0 Oe.

The normal-state resistivity of BeAu is analyzed using the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model, which describes the resistivity arising due to electron scattering from acoustic phonons. The temperature dependence of the resistivity, _r_(T), is modeled by

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+\rho_{\text{BG}}(T),\] (1)

where r0 is the temperature independent residual resistivity due to defect scattering whereas _r_BG is the BG resistivity

  given by [36]

\[\rho_{\text{BG}}(T)=4C\bigg{(}\frac{T}{\Theta_{R}}\bigg{)}^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{R}/ T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{\text{c}}-1)(1-e^{-x})}dx,\] (2)

where \Theta_{R} is the Debye temperature obtained from resistivity measurements, while C is a material dependent prefactor [37]. The best fit for the above data using the BG model is shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 2(a) and yields a Debye temperature \Theta_{R}=(345\pm 2) K, C = (136\pm 15)\mu\Omega cm and residual resistivity \rho_{0}=(1.36\pm 0.05)\mu\Omega cm. The value of the Debye temperature \Theta_{R} is close to that extracted later from the specific heat measurements.

The mean free path l can be calculated using the Fermi velocity v_{F} and the scattering time t using the relation l=v_{F}\tau. Based on the Drude model, v_{F} is given by \hbar k_{F}/\text{m}^{*} and scattering time t \tau^{-1}=\text{ne}^{2}\rho_{0}/\text{m}^{*}, where m^{*} is the effective mass, k_{F} is the Fermi vector, and n is the electron carrier density. As already shown in Ref. [31], the electron density for BeAu is n=4/V=3.93\times 10^{28} m^{-3} for V=101.746 A^{3}. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, we can use the above value of n to estimate the Fermi wave vector k_{F}=(3n\pi^{2})^{1/3}=1.05 A^{-1}. The effective mass m^{*} is estimated to be 2.8 m_{e}, using the values for \gamma_{n} (from specific heat measurement), k_{F}, and n[31]. From the calculated values of m^{*}, n, k_{F}, and \rho_{0}, we determined the Fermi velocity v_{F}=4.34\times10^{5} m/s and mean free path l=808.2 A.

### Magnetization

Superconductivity in BeAu was further confirmed by dc susceptibility (\chi) measurements taken in zero-field cooled warming (ZFCW) and field-cooled cooling (FCC) mode as shown in Fig. 3(a). The data measured in an applied field of 10 Oe demonstrates the onset of a sharp superconducting transition at T_{\text{const}}=3.2\pm 0.1 K. The value of Meissner fraction 4\pi\chi exceeds 100% due to the demagnetization effects [38]. However, it indicates a complete flux expulsion in the compound. The plot for \chi(T) measurements in several applied magnetic fields up to 300 Oe is shown in Fig. 3(b). The application of the applied magnetic field strongly suppresses the transition temperature: T_{\text{const}} becomes smaller than 1.8 K for H>150 Oe. The magnetization measurement (M) as a function of field (H) at T=1.8 K is shown in Fig. 4(a). The isothermal magnetization curve follows a near typical type-I superconducting behavior. Decreasing the applied magnetic field from H=300 Oe exhibit a partial re-entrance of diamagnetization as magnetic flux is expelled

  from the system. Such a kind of magnetization data has been observed in other type-I superconducting materials such as: LaRhSi_{3}[27], LaMSi_{3} (M= Pd,Pt) [28], Ir_{2}Ga_{9}[29]. The absence of the typical step transition at the critical field could be due to the demagnetization factor which often broadens the transition. Figure 4(b) displays the field dependence of the magnetization, M(H), which is performed at different temperatures from 1.8 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4 K. It should be noted that the high-quality sample for a type-I superconductor gives a sharp transition in magnetic isotherms. Compared to the data presented in Fig. 4(b), the magnetic isotherms in Ref. [31] are rather rounded on the high-field side. This could be due to the different quality of samples used in the respective measurements. The value for the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) is defined as the field at which the system goes from the superconducting state to the normal state. For example: H_{c}=168 Oe at T=1.8 K [see Fig. 4(a)]. The resulting values of H_{c} determined in this manner for different temperatures are summarized in Fig. 5(a) together with the values determined from the \rho(T), \chi(T), and muon data. The H_{c}(T) can be described by the conventional relation

\[H_{c}=H_{c}(0)\left[1-\left(\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right)^{2}\right],\] (3)

where T_{c} is the superconducting transition temperature and H_{c}(0) is the critical field value for T=0. Dotted black curve shows the best fit for the data which yields H_{c}(0)=259\pm 1 Oe.

### Specific heat

Figure 5(b) shows the specific heat data of BeAu measured in zero applied magnetic field. The sharp jump around T_{c}\simeq 3.17 K confirms the intrinsic nature of superconductivity in this compound. The plot C/T versus T^{2} is shown in the inset of Fig. 5(b) and shows, in the normal state, the data is best represented by C/T=\gamma_{n}+\beta T^{2}, where \gamma_{n} is the Sommerfeld coefficient and the second term \beta is the contribution from lattice. The solid black curve in the inset represents the fit to the data, yielding \gamma_{n}=2.35\pm 0.02 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and \beta=0.076\pm 0.003 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4}. The value for \gamma_{n} was used to determine the density of states at the Fermi level D_{c}(E_{\rm F}) using the relation \gamma_{n}=(\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}D_{c}(E_{\rm F}))/3, where E_{\rm F} is the Fermi energy. For \gamma_{n}=2.35\pm 0.02 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, it yields D_{c}(E_{\rm F})\simeq 1.0\pm 0.1 states eV^{-1} f.u.^{-1}. The Debye temperature is given by \theta_{D}=\left(12\pi^{4}RN/5\beta\right)^{1/3}, where using

The solid red curve represents the fully gapped superconductivity with 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=3.76. The inset shows the C/T vs T^{2} data, where it’s fitted using the relation C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}.

  R=8.314 J mol-1 K-1 and N=2, which yields \theta_{D}=370\pm 5 K. The value of \theta_{D}=370 K can be used to calculate the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{e\text{-ph}} using the McMillan formula [39],

\[\lambda_{e\text{-ph}}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{\ast}\text{ln}(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})}{(1- 0.62\mu^{\ast})\text{ln}(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})-1.04},\] (4)

where \mu^{\ast} represents the repulsive screened Coulomb potential, usually given by \mu^{\ast}=0.13. With T_{c}=3.17 K and \theta_{D}=370 K, we obtained \lambda_{e\text{-ph}}\simeq 0.54, which is similar to other weakly coupled NCS superconductors [25,27,28,40,41]. The bare-band effective mass m_{\text{band}}^{\ast} can be related to m^{\ast}, which contains enhancements from the many-body electron mass interactions m^{\ast}= m_{\text{band}}^{\ast}(1+\lambda_{e\text{-ph}})[36]. Using \lambda_{e\text{-ph}}=0.54 and assuming m_{\text{band}}^{\ast}= m_{\text{e}} gives m^{\ast}= 1.54 m_{\text{e}}.

The electronic contribution (C_{\text{el}}) to the specific heat determined by subtracting the phononic contribution from the measured specific heat data, i.e., C_{\text{el}}=C-\beta T^{3}, shown in the main panel of Fig. 5(b). The value for the specific heat jump is \frac{\Delta C}{\gamma_{e}T_{c}}\simeq 1.51, which is close to the value for a BCS isotropic gap superconductor (=1.43). This indicates weakly-coupled superconductivity in BeAu, consistent with the \lambda_{e\text{-ph}} value obtained above. The temperature dependence of the specific heat data in the superconducting state can best be described by the BCS expression for the normalized entropy S written as

\[\frac{S}{\gamma_{n}T_{c}}=-\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c }}\bigg{)}\int_{0}^{\infty}[f\ln(f)+(1-f)\ln(1-f)]dy,\] (5)

where f(\xi)=[\text{exp}(E(\xi)/k_{B}T)+1]^{-1} is the Fermi function, E(\xi)=\sqrt{\xi^{2}+\Delta^{2}(t)}, where \xi is the energy of normal electrons measured relative to the Fermi energy, y=\xi/\Delta(0), t=T/T_{c}, and \Delta(t)=\text{tanh}[1.82(1.018((1/t)-1))^{0.51}] is the BCS approximation for the temperature dependence of the energy gap. The normalized electronic specific heat is calculated by

\[\frac{C_{\text{el}}}{\gamma_{n}T_{c}}=t\frac{d(S/\gamma_{n}T_{c})}{dt}.\] (6)

Fitting the low temperature specific heat data using the above model as shown by the solid red line in Fig. 5(b) gives \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=1.82\pm 0.2. This value is consistent with the value for a BCS superconductor \alpha_{\text{BCS}}=1.764 in the weak coupling limit. Therefore, good agreement between the measured data (black symbols) and the BCS fit (solid red line), confirms an isotropic fully gapped BCS superconductivity in BeAu.

### Muon spin relaxation and rotation

The time evolution of muon spin relaxation in zero field is shown in Fig. 6 for temperatures both above T=3.5 K and below T=0.1 K the transition temperature T_{c}. The ZF-\muSR spectra are well fitted with the following function:

\[G(t)=A_{1}\text{exp}(-\lambda t)G_{\text{KT}}(t)+A_{\text{BG}},\] (7)

where A_{1} is the initial asymmetry, \lambda is the electronic relaxation rate, and A_{\text{BG}} is the time-independent background contribution. The GKT(t) function is the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function given by

\[G_{\text{KT}}(t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\big{(}1-\sigma_{\text{ZF}}^{2}t^{2} \big{)}\text{exp}\bigg{(}-\frac{\sigma_{\text{ZF}}^{2}t^{2}}{2}\bigg{)},\] (8)

where \sigma_{\text{ZF}}/\gamma_{\mu} is the local field distribution width, \gamma_{\mu}/2\pi=135.5 MHz/T being the muon gyromagnetic ratio. In systems where the superconducting state breaks time-reversal symmetry, spontaneous magnetic moments arise below T_{c}, and an increase may be observed in either \sigma_{\text{ZF}} or \lambda. It is evident from the ZF-\muSR spectra that there is no noticeable change in the relaxation rates at either side of the superconducting transition. This indicates that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the SC phase within the experimental accuracy.

The transverse-field \muSR data were collected after cooling the sample in an applied field from the normal state to the superconducting state. The TF-\muSR precession signals were obtained in different applied magnetic fields up to 300 Oe. Figure 7 show the typical MaxEnt results of the magnetic field distribution, extracted from the TF-\muSR time spectra, in the (a) Meissner, (c) intermediate, and (e) normal state. Figures 7(b), 7(d) and 7(f) show the TF-\muSR time spectra for the corresponding states. At H_{\text{app}}=50 Oe and T=0.1 K, BeAu is in the Meissner state. This state is well reflected in the MaxEnt results shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a). The peak near B_{\text{int}}\simeq 3 G corresponds to the dominant contribution of Be/Au nuclear moments. In the main panel of Fig. 7(a), the second peak around B=50 G is a background signal arising mainly due to the muons stopping in the silver sample holder. The absence of any additional peak implies that the magnetic field is completely expelled from the body of the superconductor. Figure 7(b) shows the TF-\muSR spectra in the Meissner state (H_{\text{app}}=50 Oe, T=0.1 K) where the weak decay suggests the Kubo-Toyabe behavior associated with the nuclear moments. Interestingly, there is a considerable reduction in the initial asymmetry of the

  spectra. The loss of initial asymmetry as observed in our TF-\muSR spectra of BeAu is similar to that observed in type-I superconductors LaRhSi_{3}[27], LaNiSn [42], and the recently published BeAu [35]. The missing asymmetry behavior is due to the detectors in the TF geometry unable to detect the positrons emitted in the muon spin polarization direction when the sample is in the Meissner state [35]. At the higher applied field or temperature near T_{c} the initial asymmetry recovers to its full maximum value.

The TF-\muSR spectra at Happ = 125 Oe field and T=2.0 K shown in Fig. 7(d). We analyze the spectra using the following function:

\[G_{z}(t)=G(t)+\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_{i}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{i}^{2}t^{2} \right)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t+\phi),\] (9)

where G(t) is Eq. (7), A_{i} is the initial asymmetry, \sigma_{i} is the Gaussian relaxation rate, \gamma_{\mu}/2\pi=135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, \phi is the common phase offset, and B_{i} is the first moment for the ith component of the field distribution. We found that the asymmetry spectra can best be described by two oscillating functions (N=2). In these fits, the i=1 depolarization component was fixed to \sigma_{1}=0, which corresponds to a background term arising from those muons stopping in the silver sample holder as they do not appreciably depolarize over the time scale of the experiment. From these fits, we obtain the value of the internal magnetic fields 125 G and 146 G. The former value of the internal field is the same as the applied field (from the silver holder), while the latter value can be taken as an estimate of the critical field (H_{c}) coming from the intermediate state of a type-I superconductor. The intermediate state of a type-I superconductor is induced by the nonzero demagnetization effects. Demagnetization effects cause some part of the superconducting sample to experience a field greater than the applied magnetic field. In such a situation, a stable coexistence of the flux-free regions (superconducting regions) and the regions with internal field \simeqH_{c} (normal regions) arises even if the applied magnetic field, H_{\rm{app}}, is considerably less than the critical field H_{c}. Muons implanted in these normal regions of the intermediate state will precess at a frequency corresponding to the field equal to H_{c}, whereas the muons landing in the superconducting regions will be stationary and only be affected by the nuclear moments. The muons stopping in the silver holder will precess with the applied magnetic field. In the MaxEnt data shown in Fig. 7(c), the intermediate state is well demonstrated by the two sharp peaks. For a type-II superconductor in the mixed state, we expect a component at a lower field value than the applied field due to the establishment of the flux-line lattice (FLL). This is clearly absent for our sample. On the contrary, we observe a peak near B_{\rm{int}}=146 G >H_{\rm{app}}, suggesting the intermediate state in BeAu. This is strong evidence for bulk type-I superconductivity in the compound. Indeed, similar results on BeAu [35] are reported by James _et al._ using the \muSR and magnetometry measurements which again confirms the above conclusion.

In the magnetic field of H_{\rm{app}}=300 Oe and T=0.1 K, BeAu returns to the normal state. Here, the field penetrates the bulk of the sample completely, and we see an almost homogeneous field distribution in the TF-\muSR time spectra as displayed in Fig. 7(f). Accordingly, a single sharp peak is observed at B_{\rm{int}}=300 G in the maximum entropy spectra in Fig. 7(e).

Figure 8(a) shows the internal field distribution, P(B), obtained by MaxEnt transformation at different applied fields between 50 Oe \leqslant H\leqslant 250 Oe at constant temperature T=0.1 K. The internal field distribution at T=0.1 K clearly demonstrates the change from the Meissner state (H_{\rm{app}}=50 Oe) to the intermediate state (H_{\rm{app}}=150 Oe) to the normal state (H_{\rm{app}}=250 Oe) with increasing magnetic field. At the intermediate state for H_{\rm{app}}>50 Oe, P(B) shows an additional peak at H_{c}>H_{\rm{app}} corresponding to the normal regions in the sample. Notably, there is not a significant change in the H_{c} peak position with the increase in the applied magnetic field again confirming the type-I behavior in BeAu. For a type-II superconductor in the mixed state the internal field is always less than the applied field and changes as a function of the applied field. It is noteworthy here that for H_{\rm{app}}\geqslant 50 Oe we observed a systematic decrease in the peak near B_{\rm{int}}\sim 3 G [see inset Fig. 8(a)]. This can be understood from the fact that in the low applied field (50 Oe) the sample is in the Meissner

The figure illustrates typical signal observed in the (a) Meissner, (c) intermediate state, and (e) normal state. (b), (d), and (f) show the TF-\muSR time spectra for the corresponding states.

  state, depicted by the highest peak in the inset graph. As the applied field is increased, the system goes to the intermediate state which consequently decreases the Meissner volume fraction. Since the P(B) peak near the low-field region arises from the Meissner state, it is understandable that it decreases with the increase in the applied field. At H_{\text{app}}=250 Oe the system goes to the normal state which is apparent from the presence of only one peak in the P(B) graph.

The maximum entropy spectra for TF-\muSR in a range of temperatures between 0.1 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.25 K are shown in Fig. 8(b). The sample was cooled in an applied field of H_{\text{app}}=125 Oe, and the measurements were made while warming. At T=0.1 K, two different peaks appear in the P(B) spectra at B_{\text{int}}\simeq H_{\text{app}}\simeq 125 G and B_{\text{int}}\simeq H_{\text{c}}\simeq 256 G, reminiscent of the intermediate state in a type-I superconductor. A peak also appears in the low-field region due to the superconducting regions in the sample. Interestingly, as the temperature is increased the peak position for H_{c} moves closer to H_{\text{app}} with a subsequent increase in the magnitude. The observed behavior is due to an increase in the volume of the normal core regions in the intermediate state. Thus, we can deduce the H-T phase diagram from the peak position of the critical field H_{c}. The obtained phase diagram is shown in Fig. 5(a) and is in good agreement with those obtained from the other measurement techniques. The critical field H_{c}(0) is 259\pm 1 Oe obtained after fitting Eq. (3).

### Uemura plot

We now investigate the superconducting parameters of BeAu. The London penetration depth is given by the relation \lambda_{L}=(\text{m}^{*}/\mu_{0}\text{ne}^{2})^{1/2}. Putting in the values \text{m}^{*}=2.8\text{m}_{e} and \text{n}=3.93\times 10^{28} m^{-3}, yields \lambda_{L}\simeq 450 A. The BCS coherence length can be evaluated using the expression \xi_{0}=(\frac{0.18\text{M}_{\text{TF}}}{\xi_{B}T_{c}})\simeq 1883 A. As \xi_{0} is larger than the calculated mean free path l(808.2 A), l/\xi_{0}\simeq 0.43\ll 1, indicating that the superconductivity in BeAu is in the dirty limit. In the dirty limit, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa_{\text{GL}}=0.715\lambda_{L}(0)/l[43], which gives \kappa_{\text{GL}}\simeq 0.4. \kappa_{\text{GL}} is smaller than the value 1/\sqrt{2}\simeq 0.707 separating type-I and type-II superconductivity, suggesting that BeAu is a type-I superconductor. Further using the relation \kappa_{\text{GL}}=7.49\times 10^{3}\rho_{0}\sqrt{\gamma_{\text{eff}}}, with \rho_{0} in \Omega cm and \gamma_{\text{eff}} in units \text{erg}/\text{cm}^{3} K^{2}, we obtained \kappa_{\text{GL}}=0.4, consistent with the value obtained above. The effective magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\text{eff}} is equal to 821 A, which is calculated using the relation \lambda_{\text{eff}}=\lambda_{L}\sqrt{1+\xi_{0}/l}. In addition, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi(0) is determined from the relation \kappa_{\text{GL}}=\lambda_{\text{eff}}/\xi(0), which gives \xi(0)=2052 for \kappa_{\text{GL}}=0.4.

According to Uemura _et al._[44, 45, 46] superconductors can be conveniently classified according to their \frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}} ratio. It was shown that for the unconventional superconductors such as

Figure 9: The Uemura plot showing the superconducting transition temperature T_{c} vs the Fermi temperature T_{F}, where BeAu is shown as a solid red square marker well outside the range of band of unconventional superconductors. The region displayed by the solid green lines represents the band of unconventionality obtained from Refs. [44, 45, 46].

  heavy-fermion, high-T_{c}, organic superconductors and iron-based superconductors this ratio falls in the range 0.01\leqslant\frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}\leqslant 0.1. In Fig. 9, the region between the solid green lines represents the band of unconventional superconductors. For a 3D system, the Fermi temperature T_{F} is given by the relation

\[k_{B}T_{F}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k_{F}^{2}}{2m^{*}},\] (10)

where k_{F} is the Fermi vector. Using the estimated value of k_{F} for BeAu in Eq. (10), it yields T_{F}=17\,450 K, giving \frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}\simeq 0.00018. BeAu is located well outside the range of unconventional superconductors and close to the vicinity of elemental superconductors which are type-I BCS superconductors as shown by a solid red marker in Fig. 9. This suggests conventional mechanism of superconductivity in BeAu (Table 1).

## IV Conclusions

To summarize, we have investigated the superconducting properties of cubic noncentrosymmetric superconductor BeAu using magnetization, resistivity, specific heat, and \muSR measurements. BeAu undergoes a superconducting transition at T_{c}=3.2 K. The specific heat data measured in zero applied field shows BCS superconductivity in the weak-coupling regime. The magnetization measurements along with the calculated superconducting parameters suggest type-I superconductivity in this compound, in contrast to the earlier reports which showed type-II superconductivity. The thermodynamic critical field H_{c}\simeq 259 Oe and the GL parameter \kappa_{\rm GL} is 0.4\ll 1/\sqrt{2}, again confirming type-I superconductivity. The microscopic study of superconductivity in BeAu was done by \muSR measurements. The TF-\muSR data was transformed into the probability distribution of internal fields, P(B), using the MaxEnt algorithm. The field components obtained don't show any signs of mixed state to suggest type-II superconductivity in BeAu. In a type-II superconductor in the mixed state, the peak corresponding to the applied field broadens, and an additional shoulder in the distribution is observed at lower fields due to flux line lattice. However, this feature was not seen for any temperature or field. An internal field at a higher field H_{c} than the applied field H_{\rm app} is found which is strong evidence for bulk type-I superconductivity in the compound. Furthermore, the ZF-\muSR analysis indicates that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state. Theoretically, the spin-triplet pairing or the admix pairing state is allowed in NCS superconductors. However, the lack of inversion symmetry in BeAu doesn't seem to affect the superconducting ground state, where the superconductivity turned out to be BCS-like with a singlet pairing. This raises an essential question of what stimulates the anomalous superconducting state in an NCS system: Is it just the degree of crystal structure deformation which strengthens the ASOC, or are some other parameters also involved? Notably, the size of splitting due to NCS structure is very important since if the splitting size is small the overall effect of no inversion symmetry is negated. Therefore, further studies such as photoemission spectroscopy would be beneficial to understand the superconducting gap structure in BeAu.

###### Abstract

The noncentrosymmetric superconductor BeAu has been investigated using magnetization, resistivity, specific heat, and muon-spin relaxation/rotation. BeAu crystallizes in a cubic FeSi-type B2O structure with a superconducting transition temperature T_{c}=3.2\pm 0.1 K. The low-temperature specific heat data, Ce_{4}(T), indicates a weakly-coupled fully gapped BCS superconductivity with an isotropic energy gap 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=3.76, close to the BCS value of 3.52. Interestingly, type-I superconductivity is inferred from the \muSR measurements, in contrast to the earlier reports of type-II superconductivity in BeAu. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter is \kappa_{\rm GL}=0.4<1/\sqrt{2}. The frequency domain transverse-field \muSR spectra, depicting the internal magnetic field probability distribution, P(B), also confirms the absence of the mixed state in BeAu. The thermodynamic critical field, H_{c}, is calculated to be around 259 Oe. The zero-field \muSR results indicate that time-reversal symmetry is preserved and supports a spin-singlet pairing in the superconducting ground state.

## I Introduction

Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) superconductors (SCs) that lack an inversion symmetry in the crystal structure display a variety of unusual properties in the superconducting state [1]. In superconductors with conserved inversion symmetry, the Cooper-pair wave function is strictly determined by the parity symmetry. This means that the pair wave function consists of familiar odd and even parity labels of spin-singlet and spin-triplet Cooper pairs [2]. However, for NCS SCs the conventional Cooper pairs can no longer form. The lack of inversion symmetry in NCS SCs gives rise to an asymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) which causes the splitting of the Fermi surface [1]. This splitting allows for a mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing [1,3-5]. Mixed-parity superconductivity can lead to various exotic unconventional superconducting properties [3-7].

Evidence of unconventional superconductivity has been observed in several NCS SCs, for example: CePt_{3}Si [8], Li_{2}Pt_{3}B [9,10], and CeIrSi_{3}[11] exhibit lines nodes in the superconducting gap, whereas LaNiC_{2}[12] and (La,Y)_{2}C_{3}[13] show multigap superconductivity. An unusually high upper critical field, compared to the Pauli paramagnetic limiting field, has been observed in CePtSi [14] and Ce(Rh,Ir)Si_{3}[15,16] due to the influence of strong ASOC. Furthermore, \muSR measurements have found time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in LaNiC_{2}[17], Re_{6}(Ti,Zr,Hf) [18-20], La_{7}Ir_{3}[21], and SrPtAs [22]. However, other systems such as: BiPd [23,24], Nb_{0.18}Re_{0.82}[25], LaMSi_{3} (M = Rh, Ir) [26,27], LaMSi_{3} (M = Pd, Pt) [28], T_{2}Ga_{9} (T = Rh, Ir) [29,30] appear to behave as conventional s-wave fully-gapped superconductors. These varied properties make it valuable to study additional noncentrosymmetric systems to gain a deeper understanding of their physics.

Recently, the physical properties of NCS superconductor BeAu with superconducting transition temperature T_{c}=3.3 K were reported by Amon _et al._[31]. The discovery of superconductivity in BeAu was first reported by B. T. Matthias in the early 1960s [32]. However, no comment was made regarding the nature of superconductivity and noncentrosymmetry in this material. BeAu undergoes a structural phase transition at T_{s}=80 K, where it transforms from a high-temperature CsCl structure to a low-temperature FeSi structure. In the low-temperature phase (FeSi structure) Au atoms are surrounded by seven Be atoms and six Au atoms whereas in high-temperature phase (CsCl structure) Au atoms are coordinated by eight Be atoms and six Au atoms [31]. It is the cubic FeSi-type B2O structure which is noncentrosymmetric and thoroughly investigated in this work. Previously investigated superconducting properties of BeAu suggest a weakly coupled type-II superconductivity with a reported lower and upper critical field of 32 Oe and 335 Oe, respectively [31]. However, the physical properties were inadequate to define the class of superconductivity entirely. Therefore, it warrants an in-depth analysis of the superconducting state of BeAu using the muon spin rotation/relaxation (\muSR) measurements. This method has been proven to be successful in determining the probability distribution of the internal fields, which subsequently can provide various types of information on the SC state.

In this paper, we have investigated the superconducting properties of BeAu using resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and \muSR measurements. The transverse-field (TF)-\muSR asymmetry spectra were transformed into a probability field distribution using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm [33] to observe the dominant field components. The TF-\muSR spectra in the time domain were analyzed using a sum of Gaussian field distributions to quantify the different magnetic field distribution present in the sample as a function of temperature and field. Also, the zero-field (ZF)-_m_SR measurements were employed to search for TRS breaking phenomena in the material. Interestingly, our results suggest that BeAu can be classified as a weakly-coupled type-I superconductor with a thermodynamic critical field H_{c}\simeq 259\pm 1 Oe in contrast with the earlier reports [31]. The Ginzburg -Landau parameter _k_OL obtained is around 0.4<1/\sqrt{2} again confirming type-I superconductivity in the system.

## II II. Experimental methods

The polycrystalline sample of BeAu was prepared by arc melting a stoichiometric mixture of elements Au (5N, Alfa Aesar) and Be (5N, Alfa Aesar) on a water-cooled copper hearth under a high purity argon gas atmosphere. The sample was melted several times sequentially without removal from the inert gas atmosphere. The mass loss (<2%) was confirmed after melting, and a small amount of beryllium was added to compensate for the Be loss. The as-cast sample was then sealed in the evacuated quartz tubes and annealed at 500 ^{\circ}C for 48 h.

Room temperature powder x-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a PANalytical diffractometer (Cu K_a_1 radiation, l = 1.54056 A). Temperature and field dependent magnetization data were collected using a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID MPMS 3, Quantum Design). The measurements were performed in the temperature range of 1.8 K to 4.0 K with applied magnetic fields up to 300 Oe. The electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements were performed on a physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design, Inc.).

The _m_SR measurements were carried out using the MUSR spectrometer at the ISIS Neutron and Muon facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, United Kingdom. The powdered BeAu sample was mounted on a high-purity-silver plate using diluted GE varnish. The measurements were performed under zero-field and transverse-field conditions in the temperature range 0.1-3.5 K using a sorption He3 cryostat. A full description of the _m_SR technique may be found in Ref. [34]. In ZF-_m_SR, the contribution from the stray fields at the sample position due to neighboring instruments and the Earth's magnetic field is canceled to within ~1.0 _m_T by using three sets of orthogonal coils. TF-_m_SR measurements are performed to investigate the magnetic field distribution inside the sample. The TF-_m_SR data were analyzed using the MaxEnt technique to determine the probability distribution, P(B), of the internal magnetic fields. Applied fields between 50 Oe and 300 Oe were used to fully discover the superconducting phase diagram of BeAu.

## III III. Results and discussion

### A. Structural details

Figure 1 shows the room temperature powder x-ray diffraction pattern for BeAu. The refinement shows that our sample crystallizes into a single phase of the expected noncentrosymmetric cubic FeSi-type structure with the unit cell parameter a=4.6684(3) A. Small impurity phase is observed in the XRD pattern. However, no significant effect of this impurity phase is observed in the bulk and muon spectroscopy measurements. These results are in good agreement with the published literature [31].

### B. Electrical resistivity

Electrical resistivity r versus temperature T data for BeAu was measured in zero applied magnetic field within the temperature range 1.8 K <= T <= 300 K, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The metallic nature of the sample can be inferred from the T dependence of r, where resistivity decreases consistently with decreasing temperature. At T = 300 K, the value of the resistivity is _r_(300 K) <= 112 _m_DR cm and the resistivity at T = 4 K is _r_(4 K) <= 1.35 _m_DR cm, giving a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) <=83. The low value of residual resistivity just above the superconducting state along with the high value of RRR reflects the good quality of our sample. The inset of Fig. 2(a) highlights the sharp drop to zero resistance below _T_const = 3.25 K, signaling the onset of superconductivity in BeAu. The zero resistivity value is reached at _T_c = 3.15 K. Transition temperature _T_c, defined as the midpoint of the transition, is 3.2 +- 0.1 K, close to the previously published value [31, 35]. The _r_(_T_) measurements were performed at various applied magnetic fields between 0 Oe <= H <= 200 Oe as shown in Fig. 2(b). The application of the magnetic field suppresses T_c_ rapidly; at H = 200 Oe, T_c_ decreases below 1.8 K from 3.17 K at H = 0 Oe.

The normal-state resistivity of BeAu is analyzed using the Bloch-Gruneisen (BG) model, which describes the resistivity arising due to electron scattering from acoustic phonons. The temperature dependence of the resistivity, _r_(T), is modeled by

\[\rho(T)=\rho_{0}+\rho_{\text{BG}}(T),\] (1)

where r0 is the temperature independent residual resistivity due to defect scattering whereas _r_BG is the BG resistivity

  given by [36]

\[\rho_{\text{BG}}(T)=4C\bigg{(}\frac{T}{\Theta_{R}}\bigg{)}^{5}\int_{0}^{\Theta_{R}/ T}\frac{x^{5}}{(e^{\text{c}}-1)(1-e^{-x})}dx,\] (2)

where \Theta_{R} is the Debye temperature obtained from resistivity measurements, while C is a material dependent prefactor [37]. The best fit for the above data using the BG model is shown by the solid red curve in Fig. 2(a) and yields a Debye temperature \Theta_{R}=(345\pm 2) K, C = (136\pm 15)\mu\Omega cm and residual resistivity \rho_{0}=(1.36\pm 0.05)\mu\Omega cm. The value of the Debye temperature \Theta_{R} is close to that extracted later from the specific heat measurements.

The mean free path l can be calculated using the Fermi velocity v_{F} and the scattering time t using the relation l=v_{F}\tau. Based on the Drude model, v_{F} is given by \hbar k_{F}/\text{m}^{*} and scattering time t \tau^{-1}=\text{ne}^{2}\rho_{0}/\text{m}^{*}, where m^{*} is the effective mass, k_{F} is the Fermi vector, and n is the electron carrier density. As already shown in Ref. [31], the electron density for BeAu is n=4/V=3.93\times 10^{28} m^{-3} for V=101.746 A^{3}. Assuming a spherical Fermi surface, we can use the above value of n to estimate the Fermi wave vector k_{F}=(3n\pi^{2})^{1/3}=1.05 A^{-1}. The effective mass m^{*} is estimated to be 2.8 m_{e}, using the values for \gamma_{n} (from specific heat measurement), k_{F}, and n[31]. From the calculated values of m^{*}, n, k_{F}, and \rho_{0}, we determined the Fermi velocity v_{F}=4.34\times10^{5} m/s and mean free path l=808.2 A.

### Magnetization

Superconductivity in BeAu was further confirmed by dc susceptibility (\chi) measurements taken in zero-field cooled warming (ZFCW) and field-cooled cooling (FCC) mode as shown in Fig. 3(a). The data measured in an applied field of 10 Oe demonstrates the onset of a sharp superconducting transition at T_{\text{const}}=3.2\pm 0.1 K. The value of Meissner fraction 4\pi\chi exceeds 100% due to the demagnetization effects [38]. However, it indicates a complete flux expulsion in the compound. The plot for \chi(T) measurements in several applied magnetic fields up to 300 Oe is shown in Fig. 3(b). The application of the applied magnetic field strongly suppresses the transition temperature: T_{\text{const}} becomes smaller than 1.8 K for H>150 Oe. The magnetization measurement (M) as a function of field (H) at T=1.8 K is shown in Fig. 4(a). The isothermal magnetization curve follows a near typical type-I superconducting behavior. Decreasing the applied magnetic field from H=300 Oe exhibit a partial re-entrance of diamagnetization as magnetic flux is expelled

Figure 3: (a) Temperature dependence of the dc susceptibility \chi(T) in ZFCW and FCC mode shows the superconductivity at T_{\text{const}}=3.22 K. (b) The \chi(T) measurements were done at different applied magnetic fields between 0 Oe \leqslant H\leqslant 300 Oe.

  from the system. Such a kind of magnetization data has been observed in other type-I superconducting materials such as: LaRhSi_{3}[27], LaMSi_{3} (M= Pd,Pt) [28], Ir_{2}Ga_{9}[29]. The absence of the typical step transition at the critical field could be due to the demagnetization factor which often broadens the transition. Figure 4(b) displays the field dependence of the magnetization, M(H), which is performed at different temperatures from 1.8 K \leqslant T\leqslant 4 K. It should be noted that the high-quality sample for a type-I superconductor gives a sharp transition in magnetic isotherms. Compared to the data presented in Fig. 4(b), the magnetic isotherms in Ref. [31] are rather rounded on the high-field side. This could be due to the different quality of samples used in the respective measurements. The value for the thermodynamic critical field H_{c}(T) is defined as the field at which the system goes from the superconducting state to the normal state. For example: H_{c}=168 Oe at T=1.8 K [see Fig. 4(a)]. The resulting values of H_{c} determined in this manner for different temperatures are summarized in Fig. 5(a) together with the values determined from the \rho(T), \chi(T), and muon data. The H_{c}(T) can be described by the conventional relation

\[H_{c}=H_{c}(0)\left[1-\left(\frac{T}{T_{c}}\right)^{2}\right],\] (3)

where T_{c} is the superconducting transition temperature and H_{c}(0) is the critical field value for T=0. Dotted black curve shows the best fit for the data which yields H_{c}(0)=259\pm 1 Oe.

### Specific heat

Figure 5(b) shows the specific heat data of BeAu measured in zero applied magnetic field. The sharp jump around T_{c}\simeq 3.17 K confirms the intrinsic nature of superconductivity in this compound. The plot C/T versus T^{2} is shown in the inset of Fig. 5(b) and shows, in the normal state, the data is best represented by C/T=\gamma_{n}+\beta T^{2}, where \gamma_{n} is the Sommerfeld coefficient and the second term \beta is the contribution from lattice. The solid black curve in the inset represents the fit to the data, yielding \gamma_{n}=2.35\pm 0.02 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2} and \beta=0.076\pm 0.003 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-4}. The value for \gamma_{n} was used to determine the density of states at the Fermi level D_{c}(E_{\rm F}) using the relation \gamma_{n}=(\pi^{2}k_{B}^{2}D_{c}(E_{\rm F}))/3, where E_{\rm F} is the Fermi energy. For \gamma_{n}=2.35\pm 0.02 mJ mol^{-1} K^{-2}, it yields D_{c}(E_{\rm F})\simeq 1.0\pm 0.1 states eV^{-1} f.u.^{-1}. The Debye temperature is given by \theta_{D}=\left(12\pi^{4}RN/5\beta\right)^{1/3}, where using

The solid red curve represents the fully gapped superconductivity with 2\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=3.76. The inset shows the C/T vs T^{2} data, where it’s fitted using the relation C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}.

  R=8.314 J mol-1 K-1 and N=2, which yields \theta_{D}=370\pm 5 K. The value of \theta_{D}=370 K can be used to calculate the electron-phonon coupling constant \lambda_{e\text{-ph}} using the McMillan formula [39],

\[\lambda_{e\text{-ph}}=\frac{1.04+\mu^{\ast}\text{ln}(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})}{(1- 0.62\mu^{\ast})\text{ln}(\theta_{D}/1.45T_{c})-1.04},\] (4)

where \mu^{\ast} represents the repulsive screened Coulomb potential, usually given by \mu^{\ast}=0.13. With T_{c}=3.17 K and \theta_{D}=370 K, we obtained \lambda_{e\text{-ph}}\simeq 0.54, which is similar to other weakly coupled NCS superconductors [25,27,28,40,41]. The bare-band effective mass m_{\text{band}}^{\ast} can be related to m^{\ast}, which contains enhancements from the many-body electron mass interactions m^{\ast}= m_{\text{band}}^{\ast}(1+\lambda_{e\text{-ph}})[36]. Using \lambda_{e\text{-ph}}=0.54 and assuming m_{\text{band}}^{\ast}= m_{\text{e}} gives m^{\ast}= 1.54 m_{\text{e}}.

The electronic contribution (C_{\text{el}}) to the specific heat determined by subtracting the phononic contribution from the measured specific heat data, i.e., C_{\text{el}}=C-\beta T^{3}, shown in the main panel of Fig. 5(b). The value for the specific heat jump is \frac{\Delta C}{\gamma_{e}T_{c}}\simeq 1.51, which is close to the value for a BCS isotropic gap superconductor (=1.43). This indicates weakly-coupled superconductivity in BeAu, consistent with the \lambda_{e\text{-ph}} value obtained above. The temperature dependence of the specific heat data in the superconducting state can best be described by the BCS expression for the normalized entropy S written as

\[\frac{S}{\gamma_{n}T_{c}}=-\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\bigg{(}\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c }}\bigg{)}\int_{0}^{\infty}[f\ln(f)+(1-f)\ln(1-f)]dy,\] (5)

where f(\xi)=[\text{exp}(E(\xi)/k_{B}T)+1]^{-1} is the Fermi function, E(\xi)=\sqrt{\xi^{2}+\Delta^{2}(t)}, where \xi is the energy of normal electrons measured relative to the Fermi energy, y=\xi/\Delta(0), t=T/T_{c}, and \Delta(t)=\text{tanh}[1.82(1.018((1/t)-1))^{0.51}] is the BCS approximation for the temperature dependence of the energy gap. The normalized electronic specific heat is calculated by

\[\frac{C_{\text{el}}}{\gamma_{n}T_{c}}=t\frac{d(S/\gamma_{n}T_{c})}{dt}.\] (6)

Fitting the low temperature specific heat data using the above model as shown by the solid red line in Fig. 5(b) gives \Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}=1.82\pm 0.2. This value is consistent with the value for a BCS superconductor \alpha_{\text{BCS}}=1.764 in the weak coupling limit. Therefore, good agreement between the measured data (black symbols) and the BCS fit (solid red line), confirms an isotropic fully gapped BCS superconductivity in BeAu.

### Muon spin relaxation and rotation

The time evolution of muon spin relaxation in zero field is shown in Fig. 6 for temperatures both above T=3.5 K and below T=0.1 K the transition temperature T_{c}. The ZF-\muSR spectra are well fitted with the following function:

\[G(t)=A_{1}\text{exp}(-\lambda t)G_{\text{KT}}(t)+A_{\text{BG}},\] (7)

where A_{1} is the initial asymmetry, \lambda is the electronic relaxation rate, and A_{\text{BG}} is the time-independent background contribution. The GKT(t) function is the Gaussian Kubo-Toyabe function given by

\[G_{\text{KT}}(t)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}\big{(}1-\sigma_{\text{ZF}}^{2}t^{2} \big{)}\text{exp}\bigg{(}-\frac{\sigma_{\text{ZF}}^{2}t^{2}}{2}\bigg{)},\] (8)

where \sigma_{\text{ZF}}/\gamma_{\mu} is the local field distribution width, \gamma_{\mu}/2\pi=135.5 MHz/T being the muon gyromagnetic ratio. In systems where the superconducting state breaks time-reversal symmetry, spontaneous magnetic moments arise below T_{c}, and an increase may be observed in either \sigma_{\text{ZF}} or \lambda. It is evident from the ZF-\muSR spectra that there is no noticeable change in the relaxation rates at either side of the superconducting transition. This indicates that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the SC phase within the experimental accuracy.

The transverse-field \muSR data were collected after cooling the sample in an applied field from the normal state to the superconducting state. The TF-\muSR precession signals were obtained in different applied magnetic fields up to 300 Oe. Figure 7 show the typical MaxEnt results of the magnetic field distribution, extracted from the TF-\muSR time spectra, in the (a) Meissner, (c) intermediate, and (e) normal state. Figures 7(b), 7(d) and 7(f) show the TF-\muSR time spectra for the corresponding states. At H_{\text{app}}=50 Oe and T=0.1 K, BeAu is in the Meissner state. This state is well reflected in the MaxEnt results shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a). The peak near B_{\text{int}}\simeq 3 G corresponds to the dominant contribution of Be/Au nuclear moments. In the main panel of Fig. 7(a), the second peak around B=50 G is a background signal arising mainly due to the muons stopping in the silver sample holder. The absence of any additional peak implies that the magnetic field is completely expelled from the body of the superconductor. Figure 7(b) shows the TF-\muSR spectra in the Meissner state (H_{\text{app}}=50 Oe, T=0.1 K) where the weak decay suggests the Kubo-Toyabe behavior associated with the nuclear moments. Interestingly, there is a considerable reduction in the initial asymmetry of the

  spectra. The loss of initial asymmetry as observed in our TF-\muSR spectra of BeAu is similar to that observed in type-I superconductors LaRhSi_{3}[27], LaNiSn [42], and the recently published BeAu [35]. The missing asymmetry behavior is due to the detectors in the TF geometry unable to detect the positrons emitted in the muon spin polarization direction when the sample is in the Meissner state [35]. At the higher applied field or temperature near T_{c} the initial asymmetry recovers to its full maximum value.

The TF-\muSR spectra at Happ = 125 Oe field and T=2.0 K shown in Fig. 7(d). We analyze the spectra using the following function:

\[G_{z}(t)=G(t)+\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_{i}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{i}^{2}t^{2} \right)\cos(\gamma_{\mu}B_{i}t+\phi),\] (9)

where G(t) is Eq. (7), A_{i} is the initial asymmetry, \sigma_{i} is the Gaussian relaxation rate, \gamma_{\mu}/2\pi=135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic ratio, \phi is the common phase offset, and B_{i} is the first moment for the ith component of the field distribution. We found that the asymmetry spectra can best be described by two oscillating functions (N=2). In these fits, the i=1 depolarization component was fixed to \sigma_{1}=0, which corresponds to a background term arising from those muons stopping in the silver sample holder as they do not appreciably depolarize over the time scale of the experiment. From these fits, we obtain the value of the internal magnetic fields 125 G and 146 G. The former value of the internal field is the same as the applied field (from the silver holder), while the latter value can be taken as an estimate of the critical field (H_{c}) coming from the intermediate state of a type-I superconductor. The intermediate state of a type-I superconductor is induced by the nonzero demagnetization effects. Demagnetization effects cause some part of the superconducting sample to experience a field greater than the applied magnetic field. In such a situation, a stable coexistence of the flux-free regions (superconducting regions) and the regions with internal field \simeqH_{c} (normal regions) arises even if the applied magnetic field, H_{\rm{app}}, is considerably less than the critical field H_{c}. Muons implanted in these normal regions of the intermediate state will precess at a frequency corresponding to the field equal to H_{c}, whereas the muons landing in the superconducting regions will be stationary and only be affected by the nuclear moments. The muons stopping in the silver holder will precess with the applied magnetic field. In the MaxEnt data shown in Fig. 7(c), the intermediate state is well demonstrated by the two sharp peaks. For a type-II superconductor in the mixed state, we expect a component at a lower field value than the applied field due to the establishment of the flux-line lattice (FLL). This is clearly absent for our sample. On the contrary, we observe a peak near B_{\rm{int}}=146 G >H_{\rm{app}}, suggesting the intermediate state in BeAu. This is strong evidence for bulk type-I superconductivity in the compound. Indeed, similar results on BeAu [35] are reported by James _et al._ using the \muSR and magnetometry measurements which again confirms the above conclusion.

In the magnetic field of H_{\rm{app}}=300 Oe and T=0.1 K, BeAu returns to the normal state. Here, the field penetrates the bulk of the sample completely, and we see an almost homogeneous field distribution in the TF-\muSR time spectra as displayed in Fig. 7(f). Accordingly, a single sharp peak is observed at B_{\rm{int}}=300 G in the maximum entropy spectra in Fig. 7(e).

Figure 8(a) shows the internal field distribution, P(B), obtained by MaxEnt transformation at different applied fields between 50 Oe \leqslant H\leqslant 250 Oe at constant temperature T=0.1 K. The internal field distribution at T=0.1 K clearly demonstrates the change from the Meissner state (H_{\rm{app}}=50 Oe) to the intermediate state (H_{\rm{app}}=150 Oe) to the normal state (H_{\rm{app}}=250 Oe) with increasing magnetic field. At the intermediate state for H_{\rm{app}}>50 Oe, P(B) shows an additional peak at H_{c}>H_{\rm{app}} corresponding to the normal regions in the sample. Notably, there is not a significant change in the H_{c} peak position with the increase in the applied magnetic field again confirming the type-I behavior in BeAu. For a type-II superconductor in the mixed state the internal field is always less than the applied field and changes as a function of the applied field. It is noteworthy here that for H_{\rm{app}}\geqslant 50 Oe we observed a systematic decrease in the peak near B_{\rm{int}}\sim 3 G [see inset Fig. 8(a)]. This can be understood from the fact that in the low applied field (50 Oe) the sample is in the Meissner

Figure 7: Field distributions and TF-\muSR signals. Field distribution of the local field probed by the muons, P(B), obtained by MaxEnt transformation of the TF-\muSR time spectra at different temperatures and applied field. The figure illustrates typical signal observed in the (a) Meissner, (c) intermediate state, and (e) normal state. (b), (d), and (f) show the TF-\muSR time spectra for the corresponding states. The solid lines are fits to the data using a fit function, described in Eq. (9).

  state, depicted by the highest peak in the inset graph. As the applied field is increased, the system goes to the intermediate state which consequently decreases the Meissner volume fraction. Since the P(B) peak near the low-field region arises from the Meissner state, it is understandable that it decreases with the increase in the applied field. At H_{\text{app}}=250 Oe the system goes to the normal state which is apparent from the presence of only one peak in the P(B) graph.

The maximum entropy spectra for TF-\muSR in a range of temperatures between 0.1 K \leqslant T\leqslant 2.25 K are shown in Fig. 8(b). The sample was cooled in an applied field of H_{\text{app}}=125 Oe, and the measurements were made while warming. At T=0.1 K, two different peaks appear in the P(B) spectra at B_{\text{int}}\simeq H_{\text{app}}\simeq 125 G and B_{\text{int}}\simeq H_{\text{c}}\simeq 256 G, reminiscent of the intermediate state in a type-I superconductor. A peak also appears in the low-field region due to the superconducting regions in the sample. Interestingly, as the temperature is increased the peak position for H_{c} moves closer to H_{\text{app}} with a subsequent increase in the magnitude. The observed behavior is due to an increase in the volume of the normal core regions in the intermediate state. Thus, we can deduce the H-T phase diagram from the peak position of the critical field H_{c}. The obtained phase diagram is shown in Fig. 5(a) and is in good agreement with those obtained from the other measurement techniques. The critical field H_{c}(0) is 259\pm 1 Oe obtained after fitting Eq. (3).

### Uemura plot

We now investigate the superconducting parameters of BeAu. The London penetration depth is given by the relation \lambda_{L}=(\text{m}^{*}/\mu_{0}\text{ne}^{2})^{1/2}. Putting in the values \text{m}^{*}=2.8\text{m}_{e} and \text{n}=3.93\times 10^{28} m^{-3}, yields \lambda_{L}\simeq 450 A. The BCS coherence length can be evaluated using the expression \xi_{0}=(\frac{0.18\text{M}_{\text{TF}}}{\xi_{B}T_{c}})\simeq 1883 A. As \xi_{0} is larger than the calculated mean free path l(808.2 A), l/\xi_{0}\simeq 0.43\ll 1, indicating that the superconductivity in BeAu is in the dirty limit. In the dirty limit, the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter \kappa_{\text{GL}}=0.715\lambda_{L}(0)/l[43], which gives \kappa_{\text{GL}}\simeq 0.4. \kappa_{\text{GL}} is smaller than the value 1/\sqrt{2}\simeq 0.707 separating type-I and type-II superconductivity, suggesting that BeAu is a type-I superconductor. Further using the relation \kappa_{\text{GL}}=7.49\times 10^{3}\rho_{0}\sqrt{\gamma_{\text{eff}}}, with \rho_{0} in \Omega cm and \gamma_{\text{eff}} in units \text{erg}/\text{cm}^{3} K^{2}, we obtained \kappa_{\text{GL}}=0.4, consistent with the value obtained above. The effective magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{\text{eff}} is equal to 821 A, which is calculated using the relation \lambda_{\text{eff}}=\lambda_{L}\sqrt{1+\xi_{0}/l}. In addition, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length \xi(0) is determined from the relation \kappa_{\text{GL}}=\lambda_{\text{eff}}/\xi(0), which gives \xi(0)=2052 for \kappa_{\text{GL}}=0.4.

According to Uemura _et al._[44, 45, 46] superconductors can be conveniently classified according to their \frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}} ratio. It was shown that for the unconventional superconductors such as

The region displayed by the solid green lines represents the band of unconventionality obtained from Refs. [44, 45, 46].

  heavy-fermion, high-T_{c}, organic superconductors and iron-based superconductors this ratio falls in the range 0.01\leqslant\frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}\leqslant 0.1. In Fig. 9, the region between the solid green lines represents the band of unconventional superconductors. For a 3D system, the Fermi temperature T_{F} is given by the relation

\[k_{B}T_{F}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k_{F}^{2}}{2m^{*}},\] (10)

where k_{F} is the Fermi vector. Using the estimated value of k_{F} for BeAu in Eq. (10), it yields T_{F}=17\,450 K, giving \frac{T_{c}}{T_{F}}\simeq 0.00018. BeAu is located well outside the range of unconventional superconductors and close to the vicinity of elemental superconductors which are type-I BCS superconductors as shown by a solid red marker in Fig. 9. This suggests conventional mechanism of superconductivity in BeAu (Table 1).

## IV Conclusions

To summarize, we have investigated the superconducting properties of cubic noncentrosymmetric superconductor BeAu using magnetization, resistivity, specific heat, and \muSR measurements. BeAu undergoes a superconducting transition at T_{c}=3.2 K. The specific heat data measured in zero applied field shows BCS superconductivity in the weak-coupling regime. The magnetization measurements along with the calculated superconducting parameters suggest type-I superconductivity in this compound, in contrast to the earlier reports which showed type-II superconductivity. The thermodynamic critical field H_{c}\simeq 259 Oe and the GL parameter \kappa_{\rm GL} is 0.4\ll 1/\sqrt{2}, again confirming type-I superconductivity. The microscopic study of superconductivity in BeAu was done by \muSR measurements. The TF-\muSR data was transformed into the probability distribution of internal fields, P(B), using the MaxEnt algorithm. The field components obtained don't show any signs of mixed state to suggest type-II superconductivity in BeAu. In a type-II superconductor in the mixed state, the peak corresponding to the applied field broadens, and an additional shoulder in the distribution is observed at lower fields due to flux line lattice. However, this feature was not seen for any temperature or field. An internal field at a higher field H_{c} than the applied field H_{\rm app} is found which is strong evidence for bulk type-I superconductivity in the compound. Furthermore, the ZF-\muSR analysis indicates that the time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state. Theoretically, the spin-triplet pairing or the admix pairing state is allowed in NCS superconductors. However, the lack of inversion symmetry in BeAu doesn't seem to affect the superconducting ground state, where the superconductivity turned out to be BCS-like with a singlet pairing. This raises an essential question of what stimulates the anomalous superconducting state in an NCS system: Is it just the degree of crystal structure deformation which strengthens the ASOC, or are some other parameters also involved? Notably, the size of splitting due to NCS structure is very important since if the splitting size is small the overall effect of no inversion symmetry is negated. Therefore, further studies such as photoemission spectroscopy would be beneficial to understand the superconducting gap structure in BeAu.
