###### Abstract

The crystal structure of Sr0.875Nd0.125CuO2-_8_ superconducting thin film was determined by x-ray diffraction. The intensity data were collected by four-circle x-ray diffractometry and the absorption correction for a thin platelike crystal of 780 A thick was made. The structure was found to belong to space group \(P\)4/_mmm_ with \(a\) = 3.920(1) A, \(c\) = 3.418(1) A, and \(Z\) = 1, which is almost identical with that of Ca0.84Sr0.14CuO2. The Cu-O coordination was found to be square planar without detectable buckling of the plane and no apical oxygen ions were observed. The occupation factors of Sr and Nd were slightly less than the nominal ones. The anisotropic thermal parameters for Sr, Nd, and Cu ions were elongated along the \(c\) direction, indicating the crystallographical two dimensionality of the infinite-layer structure.

## I Introduction

The basic structural feature of superconducting cuprates is the existence of planar copper-oxygen sheets. The oxygen ion coordination around a copper ion is thought to be one of the most important factors to control the electronic structure and other physical properties of these compounds. As so-called infinite-layer cuprates have a crystal structure in which the corners of the CuO4 squares are shared,1 they are thought to be suitable cuprates for the study of the role of copper-oxygen sheets in the mechanism of superconductivity.

Superconducting cuprates having an infinite-layer structure, such as Sr1-_x_Nd_CuO2-_8_, can be synthesized by high-pressure synthesis techniques2 or vapor-deposition techniques.3,4 Unfortunately, single crystals of these compounds have not yet been obtained. Therefore, epitaxially grown thin films are considered to be single crystals employed for the investigation of physical properties of the compounds. The crystal structure provides basic information for understanding the physical properties. However, there has been little information about the crystal structures of thin films because of the difficulty in determining them.

In this study, we determined the crystal structure of Sr1-_x_Nd_x_CuO2-_8_ superconducting thin film using the intensity data collected by four-circle x-ray diffractometry. In the analysis, the absorption correction for the thin platelike crystal was performed and the crystal structure was refined.

## II Experiment

### Sample preparation

The thin-film sample was prepared by the pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) method. An ArF excimer laser with the wavelength of 193 nm (Lumonics: EX-748) was used as a light source. The ceramic target of the nominal composition was prepared by a solid-state reaction method. SrTiO3 single-crystal wafer cut in a (100) orientation was used as the substrate. The size of the substrate was 10 mm square and 0.3 mm thick. The substrate temperature was approximately 600 degC during the deposition process. The distance between the target and substrate was set at 100 mm. Deposition was performed in an oxygen gas of 0.13 Pa irradiated by a low-pressure mercury lamp. The number of laser pulse shots required to yield a film thickness of 78 nm was 3 x 104. The film thickness was measured using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. The film composition was the same as the nominal composition within the experimental error (~5%) of the inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. After deposition, the film was kept in vacuum for half an hour and cooled at the rate of 20 degC/min. The background pressure was lower than 10-4 Pa.

### X-ray-diffraction measurement

The sample was first analyzed by a two-circle x-ray diffractometer and by an x-ray precession camera using Cu _K_a radiation. The film was confirmed to consist of a single-phase infinite-layer compound, because no other peaks than those from both the infinite-layer compound and the substrate material were observed.

The integrated x-ray-diffraction intensity collection was carried out using four-circle diffractometers (RIGAKU AFC7R and AFC5R) using Cu _K_a radiation and Mo _K_a radiation. The x-ray beam was collimated to 0.5 mm_b_. The sample was cut into 3 mm square, attached on a glass capillary with epoxy, mounted on a eccentric goniohad in a direction so that the \(c\) axis of the film, which is perpendicular to the film surface, was accurately parallel to the _ph_ axis of the diffractometer.

 First, the setting parameters and cell constants for the SrTiO3 substrate crystal were refined. Second, those for the film crystal were refined after the transformation of the setting parameters to the film crystal from the substrate crystal. Then the integrated intensities of Bragg spots from the film were measured. All spots in the reciprocal space upper the film surface (that is, \(h\) and \(k\) had both negative and positive values and \(l\) only positive), were collected. Redundant data were not removed. The conditions for the data collection are summarized in Table I and II.

### Absorption correction for thin crystal

The absorption correction was carried out because the shape of the crystal was that of a thin plate. Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the sample setting. The data were collected in a symmetrical setting where the angle \(o\) was half the angle 2_th_. The difference from the conventional measurement for a small spherical single crystal is that the incident-beam size is always smaller than the area of the platelike crystal through the beam path when the following condition was satisfied. It is given by

\[\frac{D}{\sin\theta\sin\chi}<r\ ,\]

where \(D\) is the diameter of the beam and \(r\) is a length of the sample along the beam direction. The projection of the incident beam upon the sample surface was ellipsoid elongated along the direction of the beam. It is required that the longer radius of the ellipsoid is smaller than the length of the sample. We used only the intensities of the spots to satisfy the above condition in the structure refinement. Most of the spots satisfied the above condition except for several low-angle spots in the measurement using Mo _K_a radiation.

The intensity of the x ray through a material can be written in the following equation:

\[I_{l} = I_{0}\exp(-\mu l)\ ,\]

where \(I_{l}\) is the intensity of the x ray through a material, \(I\)0 is the intensity of the incident x ray, \(m\) is the absorption coefficient, and \(l\) is the length of the beam path in the crystal.

The intensity of the diffracted x ray of a certain spot for the thin crystal can be written as

\[I_{d} = \frac{K(\theta)S}{2\mu}|F|^{2}A_{l}\ ,\]

where \(I_{d}\) is the diffracted x-ray intensity, _K_(_th_) is a factor including Lorenz and polarization factors, \(S\) is a cross section of the x-ray beam which is constant when the condition (1) is satisfied, _|F|_ is the absolute value of the

  structure factor and \(A_{t}\) is the absorption correction factor.

\(A_{t}\) can be given by

\[A_{t}=\frac{\int_{0}^{t}I_{t}(t)dt}{\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{t}(t)dt}\ ,\] (4)

where \(t\) is the thickness of the crystal and \(I_{t}(t)\) is \(I_{t}\) in formula (2) as a function of \(t\).

Figure 2(a) shows a view of the cross section of the crystal perpendicular to the \((hkl)\) plane and the \(\omega\) axis. \(z\) is the thickness of the crystal along the beam path, which is written as

\[z=\frac{t}{\sin\chi}\ .\] (5)

Figure 2(b) shows a view of the cross section of the crystal perpendicular to the incident x-ray beam and parallel to the \(\omega\) axis. The length of the x-ray beam path, \(l\), which is diffracted at the depth \(z\), can be written as

\[l=\frac{2z}{\sin\theta}=\frac{2t}{\sin\theta\sin\chi}\ .\] (6)

\(A_{t}\) can be calculated using formulas (2) and (4). Now \(A_{t}\) is written as

\[A_{t}=1-\exp\left\{\  measured temperature range between 10 and 320 K. These data were presented in a previous paper.7

### Crystal structure of the film

The determined atomic parameters with anisotropic thermal parameters are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

We successfully finished the refinement reducing discrepancy factors (_R_) down to 0.034 and 0.054 with the collected intensity data for Cu _K_a and Mo _K_a radiation, respectively. Observed structure factors (_F_0) and calculated values (_F_c) are listed in Tables 5 and 6. The difference between \(F\)0 and _F_c was small compared with the standard deviation of the observed structure factor (_sF_). In the space group _PA_/_mmm_, the Cu-O coordination is square planar. Occupation factors for Sr, Nd, and O ions were slightly smaller than the expected value from the nominal composition. Thermal parameters of Sr, Nd, and Cu ions were elongated in the \(c\) direction.

## IV Discussion

### Site occupancies and anisotropic thermal parameters

In general, strong correlation exists between occupation and thermal factors in the refinements. As the standard deviation of the data obtained by the measurement using Cu _K_a radiation were smaller than those obtained using Mo _K_a radiation, we employed the value refined from the data obtained using Cu _K_a radiation as occupation factors.

It is thought that the slight deficiency of Sr and Nd ions were due to the defect formation. As the average composition of the film was stoichiometric within the experimental error, the occupancy of the _A_-site cation in the matrix compound (infinite layer) occurred when SrCuO3-type defects were formed. In the refinement of the occupation factor of oxygen, a much smaller value than 0.97 leads to unreasonable temperature factors. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the oxygen content is not less than 0.97. The average copper valence calculated from the occupation factors was 1.77. From this value, the type of charge carriers are expected to be electrons. This is consistent with results for the thermoelectric-power measurement.7

The anisotropic thermal parameters of Sr, Nd, and Cu ions were elongated in the \(c\) direction. Inadequate absorption correction would lead to unusual anisotropic thermal parameters. In the present case, the difference in the anisotropy was very small between results employing two different wavelengths. Therefore, the anisotropy is thought to be intrinsic. The absolute values of the thermal parameters were different between two results. This is because the calculated electron density distribution is changed by the wavelength of the x-ray due to the difference of the anomalous dispersion terms. The elongation of the thermal parameters along the \(c\) direction indicates that the strength of the bond along this direction is weaker than that along the \(a\) or \(b\) direction. On infinite-layer cuprates, the main feature is the complete lack of the apical oxygen ion, which is a key result of the two dimensionality of the crystal and the weakness of the bond along the \(c\) direction.

### Apical oxygen and the planarity of the CuO2 sheets

It is important to investigate the coordination of oxygen ions around the copper ion in the study of the cuprate superconductors. We investigated the possibility of the existence of the apical oxygen ion. When we placed some small amount of oxygen in the apical (1_b_) site, one component of the anisotropic thermal factor of oxygen went to the negative value. Thus we concluded that the apical oxygen does not exist in the crystal.

The planarity of CuO2 sheets is also an important feature in this crystal. Billinge _et al._8 reported deviations from the planarity of CuO2 sheets in

They observed uncorrelated displacements of oxygen atoms along the \(c\) direction within a deviation of 0.1 A. In the present study, we assumed random displacements of oxygen (4\(i\) site) because no orthorhombic distortion or structural modulation was observed. When the value \(z\) is smaller than 0.015 (0.05 A), there is no remarkable change in the \(R\) factor. When the value \(z\) is increased larger than this value, the \(R\) factor gradually increases. Therefore, it is concluded that the CuO\({}_{2}\) sheets are square planar with a deviation of less than 0.05 A.

## V Conclusion

The crystal structure of the Sr\({}_{0.875}\text{Nd}_{0.125}\text{CuO}_{2-\delta}\) thin film was analyzed by an x-ray four-circle diffraction method. The film was grown on a SrTiO\({}_{3}\) substrate by the pulsed-laser deposition technique. It was confirmed that the film consists of a single phase of the infinite-layer compound. No orthorhombic distortion or structural modulation was observed. The crystal had a tetragonal cell, the lattice constants are \(a\!=\!3.92\) A and \(c\!=\!3.42\) A with the space group \(P4/mmm\). The absorption correction for a thin platelike crystal leads to success in the structure refinement. The copper-oxygen sheet was a square plane without buckling, whose deviation was less than 0.05 A, and no apical oxygen ion was coordinated. Sr and Nd ions were slightly deficient from the nominal value because of Sr\({}_{2}\)CuO\({}_{3}\) type defect formation. Anisotropic thermal parameters of Sr, Nd, and Cu ions were elongated along the \(c\) direction, indicating the crystallographic two dimensionality of the infinite-layer structure.
