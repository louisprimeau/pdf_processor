###### Abstract

The dependence of the low-temperature specific heat of (La1.8Sr0.15)CuO4 on magnetic field (_H_) is reported. Low concentrations of paramagnetic centers allow a different approach to analysis of the data that minimizes the problem of identifying the effects of the line nodes in the energy gap that are expected for _d_-wave pairing. As a consequence, these effects can be recognized even in the raw data. The data show evidence of the \(T^{2}\) term expected for \(H\) = 0, and a well defined \(H^{1/2}T\) term for \(H\) \(\neq\) 0. They conform to a scaling relation recently predicted for _d_-wave pairing.

Tunneling and vortex-imaging experiments that give information on the symmetry of the order parameter have been interpreted as showing the presence of a dominant _d_-wave component in YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (YBCO).1 Evidence bearing on the symmetry of the order parameter that might be found in bulk properties is of considerable interest for comparison with these results. The line nodes in the energy gap that are associated with _d_-wave pairing have substantial effects on the specific heat (_C_), making it the ideal bulk property for study. There have been several reports of the observation of these effects in YBCO (Refs. 2-5) but there are significant discrepancies among them, which arise, at least in part, from the presence of paramagnetic centers (PC's) and the complication in dealing with their contribution (_C_mag) to \(C\). In this context, specific-heat measurements on (La2-_z_Sr)CuO4 (LSCO) are of special interest: for comparison with the conflicting results for YBCO; as an extension of such measurements to a cuprate superconductor for which relatively little other evidence on the symmetry of the energy gap is available; and also because the concentration of PC's can be relatively low,3 making a more definitive determination of the _d_-wave effects possible.

 though the specific heats differ significantly in other respects, the _d_-wave related effects observed in these samples are essentially identical, suggesting that they are intrinsic properties characteristic of the superconducting state. Reports of a preliminary analysis of the data for one sample have been presented at several conferences.13 The somewhat different conclusions reported here are based on a more rigorous analysis of the data. (Data for 0.1 T, which contributed to an erroneous conclusion in the earlier reports,13 have been omitted in this paper because of uncertainty in the 0.1-T heat capacity of the sample holder.)

The samples were polycrystalline and \(\sim\)0.5 g in mass. Measurements were made in a calorimeter used recently for measurements on YBCO.5,11 The thermometer calibration and tests of the accuracy of the results were similar to those described briefly in connection with earlier measurements.3 The values of y*(0) and the magnitudes of the anomalies at \(T_{c}\) vary widely for LSCO samples, suggesting the presence of variable, but often large, amounts of nonsuperconducting material14 that would compromise any interpretation of \(C\) in terms of _d_-wave effects. The relatively small values of y*(0) (see below) and the relatively sharp and large anomalies at \(T_{c}\) (in comparison with those for other LSCO samples), particularly for sample A (see Fig. 1) attest the quality of these samples and their appropriateness for a study of the _d_-wave effects.

For a cuprate superconductor, _C_(_H_,_T_) includes four 'background'' contributions in addition to _C_DOS: _C_lat(_T_), the lattice contribution; _g_*(0)_T_, the zero-field _T_-proportional term; _C_hyp(_H_,_T_), the hyperfine contribution; _C_mag(_H_,_T_), the PC contribution (see, e.g., Refs. 5 and 11 for a discussion). For comparison with the theoretical predictions it is convenient to organize the contributions to _C_(_H_,_T_) in a form suggested by Eq. (2),

\[C(H,T)/T^{2} = C_{\rm DOS}(H,T)/T^{2} + \Delta(T) + \delta(H,T),\]

where \(\Delta(T) = [ C_{\rm{lat}}(T) + \gamma*(0)T]/T^{2}\) and \(\delta(H,T) = [ C_{\rm{hyp}}(H,T) + C_{\rm{mag}}(H,T)]/T^{2}\) represent, respectively, the _H_-independent and _H_-dependent background contributions. Raw data for representative fixed _T_'s are plotted as \(C(H,T)/T^{2}\) vs \(H^{1/2}/T\) (the \(+\) symbols) in Fig. 2. For each \(T\) the eight points represent the data for the eight values of \(H\). (The data were taken at very close to the same _T_'s for all \(H\), and small interpolations to the _T_'s for \(H\) = 0 were made for the \(H\) \(\neq 0\) data.) If _C_DOS = \(\beta H^{1/2}T\), as predicted for a range of \(H\) that does not include \(H\) = 0, and if _C_hyp and _C_mag were negligible, those points would fall on parallel straight lines with the slope \(\beta\), and \(H\) = 0 intercepts at \([ C_{\rm{lat}}(T) + \gamma*(0)T]/T^{2}\) for that \(T\). If there were in addition a nonzero contribution, _aT_2, to _C_DOS(_H_,_T_) at \(H\) = 0, the \(H\) = 0 point would fall above the \(H\) = 0 intercept of the straight line by an amount \(a\). In fact, the points representing the raw data do conform qualitatively to these expectations. The evident discrepancies, which are more significant at the lower temperatures, can be attributed to _C_mag and _C_hyp.

Refinement of the analysis of the data require analytical expressions for _C_hyp and _C_mag: _C_hyp., which is important only at the lowest \(T\), has the form \(D(H)T^{- 2}\), but there is no obvious analytical expression for _C_mag. Just as for YBCO (Refs. 3 and 11) the low-_T_ data could not be fitted with the simple Schottky expressions for _C_mag that would be expected for spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) PC's. For YBCO the problem was resolved by the recognition that there were singlet-ground-state PC's,15 as well as spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) PC's, and the use of ESR-derived parameters16 to obtain an expression for their low-_T_ contribution to _C_mag. Although _C_(_H_,_T_) for LSCO also suggests the presence of singlet-ground-state PC's, the data are not well represented by the ESR parameters used for YBCO (and there is no reason to expect that they would be). Without independently determined spin-Hamiltonian parameters it was not possible to find an analytical expression for _C_mag that accounted for

  the data at the lowest \(T\). However, the effect of the \(H\!=\!0\) splitting of the PC levels becomes less important with increasing \(T\). Accordingly, the analysis was restricted to 2.5 \(\leq\!T\!\leq\!10\) K for sample A and 3 \(\leq\!\tau\!\leq\!10\) K for sample B, where the data were adequately represented with spin-\({}^{\frac{1}{2}}\) Schottky functions with \(g\!=\!2.1\). The concentrations of PC's, 0.96\(\times\!10^{-4}\) and 1.7\(\times\!10^{-4}\) mol (mol LSCO)\({}^{-1}\) for samples A and B, respectively, and the parameters for \(C_{\rm hyp}\) were obtained from global fits. Essentially the same concentrations of PC's were obtained in single-field fits for \(H\!=\!3\), 5, and 7 T, the fields in which \(C_{\rm mag}\) is most important. These contributions were subtracted from \(C(H,T)\), and the points thus corrected plotted as the open circles in Fig. 2. All further analysis was based on these corrected points.

For each \(T\) and for \(H\!\geq\!1\) T the corrected data points were fitted with the straight line shown in Fig. 2. The derived values of \(\beta\) are essentially independent of \(T\) [see Fig. 3(a)], corresponding to \(C_{\rm DOS}(H)\!=\!\beta H^{1/2}T\) with \(\langle\beta\rangle\!=\!0.50\) and 0.51 mJ K\({}^{-2}\) T\({}^{-1/2}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) for samples A and B, respectively. Although the 0.5-T data were omitted from these fits, they fall very close to the lines, and their inclusion in the fits has a negligible effect on the derived values of \(\beta\). \(C_{\rm lat}\) and \(\gamma^{\ast}(0)\) were obtained by fitting the \(H\!=\!0\) intercepts of the lines, \(\Delta(T)\!=\![C_{\rm lat}\!+\!\gamma^{\ast}(0)T]/T^{2}\), with \(C_{\rm lat}\!=\!B_{3}T^{3}\!+\!B_{5}T^{5}\)\(+\!B_{7}T^{7}\), to obtain \(\gamma^{\ast\ast}(0)\!=\!0.44\) and 1.23 mJ K\({}^{-2}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) and \(B_{3}\!=\!0.259\) and 0.221 mJ K\({}^{-3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) for samples A and B, respectively. \(C_{\rm DOS}\!=\!C\!-\!C_{\rm mag}\!-\!C_{\rm hyp}\!-\!T^{2}\Delta(T)\). A somewhat different  data is more likely to lead to an erroneous conclusion about the \(T^{2}\) term in a single-\(H\) fit than a global fit.[18] Furthermore, the data reported here suggest that the Schottky anomaly would not be an adequate representation of \(C_{\rm mag}\), increasing substantially the probability of uncertainty or error. Chen _et al._ were able to resolve a _larger_\(T^{2}\) term, \(\alpha\) =0.31 mJ K\({}^{-3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\), for \(x\) = 0.22, which could be consistent with the estimate of \(\alpha\) = 0.09 mJ K\({}^{-3}\) mol\({}^{-1}\) reported here for \(x\) = 0.15 and the expectation[19] that \(\alpha\) would be approximately the same for underdoped- and optimally doped samples, but larger for overdoped samples. Their conclusions about the \(H\) dependence of \(C_{\rm DOS}\) for \(H\) \(\neq\) 0 were similar to those reported here [compare Figs. 4 and 5(a) with their Figs. 2(a) and 4]. The substantially higher values of \(\alpha\) reported by Momono _et al.[20]_ are of questionable reliability because they appear to be based on the assumption that \(C_{\rm lat}\) is the same for superconducting and Zn-doped, nonsuperconducting samples. In fact, \(C_{\rm lat}\) for both YBCO and LSCO is remarkably sensitive to doping, and even to details of sample preparation (\(C_{\rm lat}\) differs by 17% for the two LSCO samples described in this paper).

In summary, the electron-density-of-states contribution to the specific heat of (La\({}_{1.85}\)Sr\({}_{0.15}\))CuO\({}_{4}\) shows, with a high degree of accuracy, the \(H^{1/2}T\) dependence expected for line nodes in the energy gap and \(H\) \(\neq\) 0, and conformity to a scaling relation predicted for a \(d\)-wave order parameter for all \(H\). The existence of a finite contribution for \(H\) = 0, also expected for line nodes, is clearly established but its small size precludes a precise determination of its temperature dependence. The similarity of these features for two samples that differ in other respects gives confidence that they are intrinsic properties characteristic of the superconducting state.
