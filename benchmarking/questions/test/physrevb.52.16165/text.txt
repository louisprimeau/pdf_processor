### Results of the specific-heat measurements

A comparison of the low-temperature specific heat of YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, together with LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is shown in a \(C_{P}/T\) versus \(T^{2}\) representation in Figs. 1(a)\(-\)1(c). External fields are applied to suppress superconductivity to determine the normal-state heat capacity \(C_{P}\!=\!C_{e}\!+\!C_{\rm ph}\)\(=\gamma T\!+\!\beta T^{3}\) where \(\gamma\) is the Sommerfeld parameter and \(\beta\) is related to the low-temperature value of the Debye temperature by \(\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\!\!=\!(1944\!\times\!N/\beta)^{1/3}\) (\(N\) is the number of atoms per formula unit). From these data in Figs. 1(a)\(-\)1(c) all experimental quantities can be deduced which enter into the universal relations predicted by the BCS weak-coupling theory: \(H_{c}(0)/T_{c}H_{c}^{\prime}(T_{c})\!=\!0.57\), \(\gamma T_{c}^{2}/H_{c}^{2}(0)\!=\!0.168\), and \((\Delta C)_{T_{c}}/\gamma T_{c}\!=\!1.43\), where \((\Delta C)_{T_{c}}\!=\!(C_{s}\!-\!C_{n})_{T_{c}}\) is the specific-heat jump at \(T_{c}\), \(H_{c}(T)\), and \(H_{c}^{\prime}(T_{c})\) is the thermodynamic critical field and its derivative at \(T_{c}\). Strong electron-phonon coupling modifies these relations; the magnitude of these corrections was expressed in terms of the strong-coupling parameter \(T_{c}/\tilde{\omega}_{1}\) by Rainer and Bergmann [14] and finally extended to approximate formulas for a large number of superconductors by Marsiglio and Carbotte. [15, 16] Thus we present in the following the analysis of the \(C_{P}(T,\!H)\) data with respect to these quantities to examine the deviations from the aforementioned BCS values which provide a sensitive measure for the coupling strength.

It is obvious from Figs. 1(a)\(-\)1(c) that extrapolations from the normal state above T\({}_{c}\) gives too small values for \(\gamma\) since the \(C_{P}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) plots exhibit a significant deviation from linear behavior below \(T_{c}\). If, furthermore, the low-temperature heat capacity is dominated by lattice contributions containing some low-energy Einstein modes, the usually employed linearization of these plots may be precarious: The comparison of the normal-state heat-capacity ratios \(C_{e}/C_{\rm ph}\) at 10 K yielding values of about 3, 1, and 0.1 for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, respectively, indicates that the uncertainty of the \(\gamma\) value is largest for the latter compound. Additionally, its normal-state heat capacity exhibits a significant field dependence [see inset of Fig. 1(c)] which is not observed for both the Y and Lu compound after suppression of superconductivity in the normal state up to 11 T. In a previous paper [4] we derived for LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C a \(\gamma\) value of 5.2(6) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) from a fit of the low-temperature data with \(C_{P}(T)\!=\!\gamma T\!+\!C_{\rm Debye}(T)\). The numerical analysis of the specific heat with a more realistic model for the phonon spectrum (see Sec. III B) incorporating not only the Debye spectrum but also low-energy Einstein modes gives \(\gamma\!=6.4(8)\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\). In the case of LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C the same analysis yields \(\gamma\!=19.5(3)\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) instead of 18.5(5) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) (Ref. [4]), while for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C the Sommerfeld constant [\(\gamma\!=18.2(2)\) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)] remains unaffected by this procedure because of the large \(C_{e}/C_{\rm ph}\) ratio of about 3 at low temperatures. These results are collected in Table 1 where also available data from the literature [17, 18, 19, 20] together with band-structure results [5, 6, 7, 8] are compiled for a comparison.

The electron mass enhancement (\(\lambda\)) due to electron-phonon interaction and/or electron-electron correlations can be estimated from the ratio of the experimental \(\gamma\) values and the calculated density of states (DOS) at \(E_{f}\) yielding \(\gamma/\gamma_{\rm band}\!=\!(1\!+\!\lambda)\). These values summarized in Table 1 indicate weak-coupling for LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C but moderately strong-coupling superconductivity for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and YNi\({}_{2}\) B\({}_{2}\)C, if all mass enhancement is attributed to electron-phonon interactions. Note that \(\lambda\!\approx\!0.1\) for LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is incompatible with a \(T_{c}\) of 10 K which will be discussed in Sec. VI.2. Photoemission [9, 10] and x-ray-absorption spectroscopy [11] studies have shown that electron correlations

 have to be taken into account which reduce the calculated DOS at \(E_{f}\) by a factor of about 0.5.9 Accordingly, taking this reduction of the DOS at \(E_{f}\) into account, the corrected \(l\) values would place all three compounds into the very strong-coupling regime.

The specific-heat jump \((\Delta C)_{T_{c}}\) is determined from the zero-field data by assuming an idealized sharp, entropy conserving superconducting transition (see Fig. 2) yielding \(\bar{T}_{c}\) given in Table 2. In case of YNi2B2C (\(\Delta C)_{T_{c}}\) = 460 mJ/ mol K is by about 7% larger than our previous value12 but this is still 6% smaller than that of a single-crystal measurement by Movshovich _et al._17

iii.2.1 Thermodynamic- and upper critical field and an estimate for the gap-to-critical temperature ratio

The temperature dependence of the upper critical field derived from specific-heat measurements is displayed in Fig. 3 where in the inset the field dependence of the specific-heat jump of LuNi2B2C is shown in the low-field regime. Both compounds YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C exhibit a significant positive deviation of \(m\)0_H_c_2(_T_) from the initially linear dependence below 2 T being consistent with magnetic and resistivity measurements. This feature has been already noted for YNi2B2C.4,121,21 As a consequence of this positive deviation, the Werthamer formula \(H_{c}2(0) \approx - 0.7T_{c}(dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}\) underestimates the upper critical field _H__c_2(0) of YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C which will be discussed in Sec. IV.3. From the low-temperature extrapolation of _H__c_2(_T_) and the thermodynamic critical field given below we obtain the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa_{1}(0) = H_{c2}(0)/[\sqrt {2}H_{c}(0)] = 16\) for YNi2B2C which is significantly higher than our previous value12[\(\kappa_{1}(0) = 10.5\)] using the Werthamer formula but is in reasonable agreement with that deduced from magnetic measurements on single crystals by Xu _et al._22 [\(\kappa_{1}(0) = 13\)-15] and from the combination of magnetic and _m_SR data by Cywinski _et al._21 [\(\kappa_{1}(0) = 13\)]. For LuNi2B2C and LuPt1,5Au0.5B2C we obtain \(\kappa_{1}(0) = 21\) and 7, respectively.

The temperature dependence of the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\)(_T_) is obtained by integrating the entropy difference between the normal and superconducting state:

\[\frac{\mu_{0}H_{c}^{2}(T)}{2} = \int_{T_{c}}^{T}\int_{T_{c}}^{T^{\prime}}\frac{(C_{s} - C_{n})}{T^{\prime\prime}}dT^{\prime\prime}.\]

The application of the above relation to the data in Figs. 1(a) -1(c) (close to Tc we used the idealized data shown in Fig. 2) gives \(H_{c}\)(_T_), displayed in Fig. 4 from which \(H_{c}^{\prime}(T_{c})\) the slope of \(H_{c}\) at \(T_{c}\) is derived. Note, that for all three compounds the 9 T measurement is used for the normal-state heat capacity. The uncertainty of \(H_{c}\)(_T_) and its derivative is again largest for the La compound because of the field dependence of the normal-state heat capacity and the more restricted temperature range for the evaluation. Thus, we present in Fig. 5 the deviation function _D_(_t_) from the purely quadratic temperature dependence of \(H_{c}\)(_T_): \(D(T/T_{c}) = D(t) = [H_{c}(t)/H_{c}(0)] - [1 - (t)^{2}\)] for the Y and Lu compound only. As can be seen from the comparison with a BCS superconductor, LuNi2B2C exhibits a positive deviation of about 0.7% which is indicative for moderately strong coupling while the deviation for YNi2B2C with a small positive and negative deviation can be regarded as typical for medium to moderately strong coupling. A similar shape of _D_(_t_) is observed for LuPt1,5Au0.5B2C with a less pronounced deviation from the parabolic law which, however, is not shown because due to the large phonon contributions to the total heat capacity the evaluation of deviations of \(H_{c}\)(_T_) of about 1% might overstrain our data. (The lattice heat capacity is at 10 K about ten times larger than the electronic one.)

The shape of the deviation function _D_(_t_) can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate of the coupling strength via the gap-to-critical temperature ratio \(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c} = \alpha\) in terms of the phenomenological \(a\) model by Padamsee _et al._23 From the comparison of the experimental data in Fig. 5 with the

  calculated \(D(t)\) functions presented in Fig. 1 of Ref. [23], \(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\) is estimated to be 2.2 and 2.1 for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, respectively, whilst for LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C only a rough estimate can be made ranging between 2.0 and 2.2.

In a previous work [12] we demonstrated for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C that the electronic specific heat in the superconducting state follows a power law \(C_{es}\)= 3 \(\gamma T_{c}\)(\(T/T_{c}\))\({}^{a}\), with an exponent \(a\) close to 3, rather than the expected exponential behavior. This can qualitatively be seen from the rather linear behavior of the \(C_{P}/T\) versus \(T^{2}\) plots of the data below \(T_{c}\) for all three compounds. Carter _et al._[18] reported a similar temperature dependence of \(C_{es}\) on LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and LaPt\({}_{1.7}\)Au\({}_{0.3}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. Therefore a determination of the gap with the BCS formula \(C_{es}\)(\(T\))= 8.5\(\gamma T_{c}\) exp [\(-\)0.82\(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T\)] (2.5\(<T_{c}/T\)\(<\)6) cannot be performed. For a more detailed analysis of \(C_{es}\)(\(T\)) of YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C we refer to Ref. [12].

#### Thermodynamic BCS ratios

It is instructive to compare the experimental results of the dimensionless ratios \(\Delta(0)/k_{B}\bar{T}_{c}\), \((\Delta C)_{T_{c}}/\gamma\bar{T}_{c}\), \(h_{c}(0)\) = \(H_{c}(0)/H_{c}^{\prime}(\bar{T}_{c})\bar{T}_{c}\), and \(\gamma\bar{T}_{c}^{2}/H_{c}^{2}(0)\) summarized in Table 2 and their deviations from the BCS values with \(\lambda\) given in Table 1. As strong coupling modifies these ratios which are universal in the BCS limit but not in the Eliashberg theory, the deviations can be regarded as a measure of the coupling

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C & LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C & LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C \\ \hline \(\bar{T}_{c}\) ; \(T_{c\text{ onset}}\) (K) & 14.25; 14.6 & 16.1; 16.6 & 10.65; 10.8 \\  & 14.9; 15.2a  & 16.5(1)b  & 10.2(1)b  \\ \(\Delta\)_C_(mJ/mol K) & 460(5) & 693(5) & 120(15) \\  & 493a [FOOTNOTE:a]Footnote a: Correlation between the temperature dependence of the temperature dependence  strength and have been expressed as a function of the strong-coupling parameter \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm 1n}\) (for a review see, e.g., Carbotte and references therein [6]). The characteristic phonon energy \(\omega_{\rm 1n}\) is the logarithmic moment of the electron-phonon spectral function \(\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\). An increase of the coupling strength enhances the first two ratios while the latter two are reduced with respect to the BCS values given also in Table 2. Note, these data are rather consistent with each other with the exception of \(\gamma T_{c}^{2}/H_{c}^{2}(0)\) for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C which is beyond the BCS regime. As errors of \(H_{c}(0)\) and \(\tilde{T}_{c}\) enter quadratically into this ratio, a correction of our \(H_{c}(0)\) due to 5% secondary phases yields a consistent value for \(\gamma T_{c}^{2}/H_{c}^{2}(0)=0.160\) referred to as corrected in Table 2. (The same value is obtained with the single-crystal data of Movshovich [17] using a slightly reduced \(\tilde{T}_{c}\) = 14.6 K derived from a reanalysis of their specific-heat jump.)

According to the deviation of these three ratios from the BCS values given in Table 2 and the estimates for \(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\) we deduce that the coupling strength is largest for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and is slightly reduced for both YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and LaPt\({}_{.5}\)Au\({}_{.03}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. This tendency is not in line with the \(\lambda\) values derived from the ratio \(\gamma/\gamma_{\rm 0and}\) where \(\lambda\) is largest for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and rather small for LaPt\({}_{.5}\)Au\({}_{.03}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (0.1-0.3). This discrepancy is suggested to arise from the presence of electron-electron correlations and will be discussed together with \(\lambda\) values derived from the Allen and Dynes formula [24] in Sec. IV.2.

### Normal-state heat capacity

An overview of the heat capacity of superconducting LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and the two nonsuperconducting reference compounds LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) in Fig. 6 displays the general low- and high-temperature features of these systems in the normal state. Note, \(C_{P}(T)\) is given in J/gat K in order to compare the phonon contribution of YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) (crystallizing in the unfilled ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) structure) with those of the borocarbides; for the low-temperature \(C_{P}/T\) versus \(T^{2}\) plot in the inset of Fig. 6 the unit mJ/mol K is used. From the slope of the \(C_{P}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) plot (which is inversely related to the low-temperature value of \(\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\)) it is obvious that the low-energy modes of the borocarbides are considerably softer than those of YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) whilst the crossover of the \(C_{P}(T)\) data at about 120 K reveals a stiffening of the high-energy optical modes in the borocarbides with respect to YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\). The former feature is also reflected by the variation of \(\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\) in these compounds (see Table 1). The analysis of \(C_{P}(T)\) in terms of a model phonon density of states \(F(\omega)\) is given in the next section.

### Numerical analysis of the heat capacity

In order to elaborate the differences in the lattice properties of the compounds investigated we analyzed their normal-state specific heat from 2 to 300 K. This temperature range is sufficient to obtain enough information about the phonon density of states \(F(\omega)\) to perform a reliable calculation of the moments of the phonon spectrum, which are rather insensitive to shape details of the spectrum as shown by Junod and co-workers, [25, 26]

In a previous publication [4] we gave a rough parametric description of \(C_{P}(20\)-\(100\) K) with one Debye and two Einstein functions, but this set of parameters is too simple to account for all features of the measurements in the extended temperature range from 2 to 300 K. It is obvious that the description of \(C_{P}(T)\) can be improved by increasing the number of Einstein functions, but this leads to ambiguous results and a loss of physical significance.

Due to the lack of reference phonon spectra from neutron or tunneling experiments we constructed a simple model spectrum \(F(\omega)\) containing one Debye spectrum and three Gaussian contributions and evaluated the Einstein integrals of \(F(\omega)\)

\[C_{\rm ph}(T) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\!F(\omega)\,\frac{\left(\frac{\omega}{2T} \right)^{2}}{\sinh^{2}\!\left(\frac{\omega}{2T}\right)}\,d\omega\] (2)

to obtain a satisfactory agreement with the experimental specific heat by adjusting a minimum set of free parameters. The Debye spectrum with the Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}\) as the free

  parameter represents the spectral weight of the three acoustic branches of the phonon spectrum (mainly determined by the specific heat at low temperatures) and three Gaussians contributions account for the 15 optical branches. The free parameters are the peak positions \(\Theta_{E_{i}}\). In order to obtain a high-energy limit of the phonon spectrum the Gaussian contribution with the highest energy was cut off at the peak position. Gaussians were chosen because they are smooth and easy to normalize. The "hidden" parameters of the model spectrum--the widths and weights of the Gaussian contributions to the Einstein integrals--were adjusted to obtain a satisfactory fit under the constraint of minimal variation of the hidden parameters for the compound series investigated. To avoid finite spectral density at \(\omega\!=\!0\) the Einstein integrals of the Gaussian contributions were calculated from 50 K up to the cutoff energy. This leads to a negligible error in the normalization (less than 0.002), which has no influence on the moments of the spectrum. (Only in the case of LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C it was necessary to readjust the spectral weight of the contribution corresponding to \(\Theta_{E_{2}}\) to 8.5.) The choice for the hidden parameters is listed in Table 3. This procedure provides a satisfactory description of the \(C_{P}(T)\) data from 2 up to 300 K shown as full lines in Fig. 8 where the logarithmic representation is used to emphasize the distinct features of the low- and medium-temperature normal-state heat capacity of this compound series. (For the superconducting compounds LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, the normal-state data of the 9 T measurements are shown; the data of the nonsuperconducting LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C are not included for clarity, since they are situated just in between LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.)

The corresponding model spectra \(F(\omega)\) are displayed in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) and the numerical results of the characteristic temperatures are summarized in Table 4. A remarkable feature of the model spectra is the sharp low-frequency contribution (\(\Theta_{E_{1}}\)) with a weight of 1.5. If this weight is changed it is hardly possible to describe the distinct low-temperature features of the heat capacities in Fig. 8 and the associated curvatures of the \(C_{P}/T\) vs \(T^{2}\) plots in Figs. 1(a)-1(c) and Fig. 6 inset at about 80, 120, and 80 K\({}^{2}\) for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, respectively. From the comparison of the characteristic temperatures and the model spectra one can hardly deduce a decisive hint for the disappearance of superconductivity in LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C: Its low-frequency contribution (\(\Theta_{E_{1}}\)) is situated in between those of the superconducting compounds and the high-frequency

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline  & \(\Theta_{D}\) & \(\Theta_{E_{1}}\) & \(\Theta_{E_{2}}\) & \(\Theta_{E_{3}}\) (cutoff) \\ \hline Width (K) & & 18 & 140 & 300 \\ Weight & 3 & 1.5 & 8.5 & 5 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

(2).

  modes of these three compounds have nearly the same energies. In the case of LaPt\({}_{1.8}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C the Debye contribution (\(\Theta_{D}\)) is situated at about 160 K, close to the low-energy Einstein contribution (\(\Theta_{E1}\)) and causes a rather prominent maximum in the phonon density of states displayed in Fig. 7(b). In comparison to the Ni compounds the latter spectrum describes a much softer lattice.

A significant difference of the lattice properties between the filled and unfilled version of the ThCr\({}_{2}\)Si\({}_{2}\) structure emerges from the comparison of the model phonon spectra of YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) also displayed in Fig. 7(b). With regard to the missing light carbon atom in YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\), the corresponding spectral weight of the high-energy contribution (\(\Theta_{E_{3}}\)) was reduced from five to two and simultaneously the width of this part of the model spectrum was reduced to 150 K, because the flat high-energy contribution of the borocarbides cannot account for the high-temperature specific heat of YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\). This modification yields the model spectrum of YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) where the high-energy cutoff is significantly decreased to 930 K but the low-frequency modes are shifted to higher energies. The latter is also evident from a comparison of the low-temperature \(\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\) values of YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C [\(\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\)= 490(5) K] and YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) [\(\Theta_{D}^{\rm LT}\)= 570(10) K] indicating an overall lattice stiffening in the low-temperature regime, whilst the high-frequency modes soften which is also evident from the crossover of the \(C_{P}(T)\) data in Fig. 6.

The phonon spectrum of YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C can be compared with the results of Raman spectroscopy reported by Hadjiev _et al._[27] They detected four Raman-active modes with the energies corresponding to 285 K (\(B_{1g}\)), 406 K (\(E_{1g}\)), 676 K (\(E_{g}\)), and 1197 K (\(A_{1g}\)). The high-energy mode coincides quite well with the cutoff temperature of the fit and supports the applicability of the model spectrum proposed.

### Comparison of a characteristic phonon frequency \(\tilde{\omega}\) with the model spectrum

Kresin and Parkhomenko [28] demonstrated that several thermodynamic properties of strong-coupling superconductors can be described in terms of the ratio \(T_{c}/\tilde{\omega}\). For a very simple phonon spectrum, consisting of sharp well separated maxima, the characteristic phonon frequency \(\tilde{\omega}\) corresponds to the energy of the first prominent maximum of the electron-phonon spectral function \(\alpha^{2}F(\omega)\). If corrections proportional to (\(T_{c}/\omega)^{2}\) due to contributions of higher energies have to be taken into account, the value of \(\tilde{\omega}\) might be slightly higher. Applying the formula

\[\frac{(\Delta C)_{T_{c}}}{\gamma T_{c}}=1.43\left[1+1.8\left/\ \ln\frac{\tilde{\omega}}{T_{c}}+0.5\right.\right]\left(\frac{\pi T_{c}}{\tilde{\omega}}\right)^{2}\right]\] (3)

to the experimental values of the normalized specific-heat jump \((\Delta C)_{T_{c}}/\gamma T_{c}\), we obtain \(\tilde{\omega}^{\infty}\) 200 and 150 K for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, respectively. These values are in agreement with those resulting from the model spectra (see \(\Theta_{E_{1}}\) in Table 4).

A similar formula for the strong-coupling correction to the normalized gap ratio by Geilikman and Kresin [29]

\[\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c}}=1.76\left[1+5.3\left(\frac{T_{c}}{\tilde{\omega}}\right)^{2}\ln(\frac{\tilde{\omega}}{T_{c}})\right]\] (4)

yields \(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\!\equiv\!2.11\) and 1.90 for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, respectively, taking \(\tilde{\omega}(\!\approx\!\Theta_{E_{1}}\!)\) from our model spectra. Table 5 gives an overview for the estimates of \(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\) according to the \(\alpha\) model (Sec. III.1), Eqs. (4) and (13). Although Eq. (13) is given in Sec. IV.1 and contains \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm\ ln}\) which will be evaluated in the next section, we present these results in Table 5 for the convenience of a comparison since both expressions are of similar shape. Ekino _et al._[30] performed tunneling measurements on YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and reported \(\Delta(4.2\)K)/\(k_{B}T_{c}\!\approx\!1.8\) which is in reasonable agreement with the estimates collected in Table 5.

## IV Discussion

### Analysis of the thermodynamic ratios in terms of the strong-coupling corrections to the BCS values

The ratio between the critical temperature and a quantity representing a characteristic phonon frequency such as, e.g., \(\Theta_{D}\) (Ref. [32]) or \(\tilde{\omega}\) (Ref. [28]) [see Eqs. (3), (4)] has been used for a discussion of the coupling strength by various authors. Rainer and Bergmann [14] applied the Eliashberg theory for strong-coupling superconductors to several realistic superconductors and demonstrated that the magnitude of the deviations of the critical fields from BCS predictions can be estimated from the ratio \(T_{c}/\tilde{\omega}_{1}\) with \(\tilde{\omega}_{1}\) the first generalized moment of the electron-phonon spectral function \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)F(\omega)\). The moments of \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)F(\omega)\) are defined as [24]

\[\langle\omega^{n}\rangle=\frac{2}{\lambda}\int_{0}^{\infty}d\omega\alpha^{2}( \omega)F(\omega)\omega^{n-1}.\] (5)

The electron-phonon interaction parameter \(\lambda\) is a dimensionless measure of the coupling strength

\[\lambda=2\int_{0}^{\infty}d\omega\,\frac{\alpha^{2}(\omega)F(\omega)}{\omega}.\] (6)

The logarithmic average frequency \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) , equal to the \(n\!\rightarrow\!0\) limit of the sequence of average frequencies

\[\tilde{\omega}_{n}=\langle\omega^{n}\rangle^{1/n}\] (7)

can be written in the form

\[\omega_{\rm ln}\equiv\lim_{n\to 0}\tilde{\omega}_{n}=\ \exp\left(\frac{2}{\lambda}\int_{0}^{n\!  Ref. 16 for a review and references therein) derived approximate formulas for the strong-coupling corrections to the dimensionless BCS ratios:

\[\frac{\left(\Delta C\right)_{T_{c}}}{\gamma T_{c}} = 1.43\left[ {1 + 53\left( \frac{T_{c}}{\omega_{\rm ln}} \right)^{2}\ln\left( \frac{\omega_{\rm ln}}{3T_{c}} \right)} \right],\]

\[\frac{\gamma T_{c}^{2}}{H_{c}^{2}(0)} = 0.168\left[ {1 - 12.2\left( \frac{T_{c}}{\omega_{\rm ln}} \right)^{2}\ln\left( \frac{\omega_{\rm ln}}{3T_{c}} \right)} \right],\]

\[h_{c}(0) = 0.576\left[ {1 - 13.4\left( \frac{T_{c}}{\omega_{\rm ln}} \right)^{2}\ln\left( \frac{\omega_{\rm ln}}{3.5T_{c}} \right)} \right],\]

\[\frac{\Delta(0)}{k_{B}T_{c}} = 1.76\left[ {1 + 12.5\left( \frac{T_{c}}{\omega_{\rm ln}} \right)^{2}\ln\left( \frac{\omega_{\rm ln}}{2T_{c}} \right)} \right].\]

The strong-coupling variable is the ratio \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) with the average phonon frequency \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) given by Eq. (8). It was shown [16] that these equations provide a satisfactory description of the strong-coupling corrections to the BCS ratios for a large number of electron-phonon-mediated superconductors with an accuracy of about 10%. Entering the experimentally determined thermodynamic ratios in Eqs. (9)\(-\)(12), we evaluate the ratios \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) and obtain a rough estimate for \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) which is about 240 K for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, 160 K for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and 130 K in the case of LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. In order to estimate the generalized moments \(\bar{\omega}_{1}\) and \(\bar{\omega}_{2}\) which are, e.g., needed to determine the ratio \(\bar{\omega}_{2}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) for the shape factor of the Allen and Dynes formula (see below), one has to assume a reasonable frequency dependence of \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\) in Eqs. (5)\(-\)(8).

The simplest assumption is a frequency independent \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\). Since this approximation yields \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) values which are larger than the above given estimates (unambiguously too large for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C), the use of decreasing functions for \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\) seems to be reasonable. Thus we follow the approach of Junod _et al._[26] They suggested the approximation \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\)\(\propto\)\(\omega^{-1/2}\) and used the assumptions \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\)\(\propto\)\(1\) and \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\)\(\propto\)\(\omega^{-1}\) as limiting cases for the calculation of \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) , \(\bar{\omega}_{1}\) , and \(\bar{\omega}_{2}\) . The corresponding results for the average frequencies \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) , \(\bar{\omega}_{1}\) , and \(\bar{\omega}_{2}\) with the proposed assumptions on the frequency dependence of \(\alpha^{2}\) are summarized in Table 6.

The thermodynamic ratios given in Table 2 are displayed in Fig. 9 to classify the coupling strength of the compounds investigated. The solid lines in Figs. 9(a)\(-\)9(d) represent the general trend according to Eqs. (10)\(-\)(13) typical for many superconductors which allow an apparent graphical comparison with our results for the borocarbides. The open symbols displayed in Figs. 9(a)\(-\)9(d) correspond to \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) values determined under the assumption of \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\)\(\propto\)\(\omega^{-1/2}\) and the associated horizontal error bars correspond to \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) values determined with \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\)\(\propto\)\(\omega^{-1}\) and \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\)\(\propto\)\(1\), respectively. Figure 9 further illustrates that the coupling strength of these three superconductors is of the same magnitude and decreases slightly in the sequence: LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.

The \(\bar{\omega}_{1}\) values of Table 6 can be compared with the theoretical predictions of Rainer and Bergmann [14] for the magnitude of the strong-coupling correction of the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}\) from BCS at given ratios of \(T_{c}/\bar{\omega}_{1}\) . The numerical results for the enhancement parameters \(\eta_{H_{c}}(T_{c})\) and \(\eta_{H_{c}}(0)\) of the thermodynamic critical field \(H_{c}(T)\) = \(\eta_{H_{c}}(T)H_{c}^{\rm BCS}(T)\) as well as \(\eta_{H_{c2}}(T_{c})\) and \(\eta_{H_{c2}}(0)\), the enhancement parameters of the upper critical field, can be deduced from Fig. 1 of Ref. 14. Calculations for the upper critical field have been performed in the dirty-limit approximation, which cannot be applied to the \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C compounds because they are clean-limit superconductors [31].

The experimental values of the enhancement parameters \(\eta_{H_{c}}(0)\) and \(\eta_{H_{c}}(T_{c})\) were determined from the relations \(\gamma T_{c}^{2}/H_{c}^{2}(0)\) = 0.168 \(\eta_{H_{c}}^{-2}(0)\) and \((\Delta C)_{T_{c}}/\gamma T_{c}\) = 1.43 \(\eta_{H_{c}}^{2}(T_{c})\). Table 7 contains our experimental enhancement factors of the thermodynamic critical field and those taken from Rainer and Bergmann [14] for the \(T_{c}/\bar{\omega}_{1}\) values corresponding to Table 6. The comparison of the data in Table 7 reveals that the approximation \(\alpha^{2}\)\(\propto\)\(\omega^{-1/2}\) appears to be a reasonable approach.

### Determination of the electron-phonon interaction parameter

For the evaluation of \(\lambda\) we use the Allen and Dynes formula [24] with a Coulomb pseudopotential \(\mu\)* = 0.13 (see, e.g., Ref. 32)

\[T_{c} = \frac{f_{1}f_{2}\omega_{\rm ln}}{1.20}\exp\left( {- \frac{1.04(1+\lambda)}{\lambda-\mu^{*}-0.62\lambda\mu^{*}}} \right),\]

where \(f_{1}\) and \(f_{2}\) are corrective factors given by

\[f_{1} = \left[ {1 + \left( \frac{\lambda}{2.46(1+3.8\mu^{*})} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \right]^{\frac{1}{3}},\]

\[f_{2} = 1 + \frac{\left( \frac{\bar{\omega}_{2}}{\omega_{\rm ln}} - 1 \right)\lambda^{2}}{\lambda^{2}+1.82(1+6.3\mu^{*})\frac{\bar{\omega}_{2}}{\omega_{ \rm ln}}}.\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline  & & YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C & & & LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C & & & LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C & & & LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C \\ \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\)\(\propto\)\(\omega^{3}\) & \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) (K) & \(\bar{\omega}_{1}\)  For the three superconducting compounds we obtain \(\lambda\) values of about 1, while for LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C only an upper limit (\(\lambda\!<\!0.5\)) can be estimated since it is nonsuperconducting down to 1.5 K. It should be noted that due to the large ratio \(\delta_{2}/\omega_{\rm ln}\!\sim\!\!1.8\) the McMillan formula[32] yields \(\lambda\) values by about 20% smaller than those from the Allen and Dynes expression. These \(\lambda\) values labeled as \(\lambda_{\rm AD}\) and the average of the function \(\alpha^{2}(\omega)\), \(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}\)m\((1/2)\lambda\delta_{1}\), are listed in Table 8 together with those given in Table 1 that were determined from the ratio \(\gamma_{\rm exp}/\gamma_{\rm band}\!=\!(1\!+\!\lambda_{\rm tot})\). As the latter contain the total mass enhancement (electron correlations and electron-phonon interaction), \(\lambda_{\rm tot}\) should be larger than \(\lambda_{\rm AD}\). Hence, the difference between both sets of \(\lambda\) values in Table 8 indicates that band-structure calculations overestimate \(N(E_{f})\). This is in agreement with conclusions from spectroscopic measurements[9, 10, 11] where the calculated DOS peak at \(E_{f}\) is found to be reduced by electron correlations. On the other hand we concluded[4] in agreement with Carter _et al.[18]_ from the comparison of the Pauli susceptibility with \(\gamma\) values and band-structure data that the static susceptibility is not significantly enhanced.

Although the general trend of the variation of \(\gamma_{\rm band}\) within this compound series qualitatively follows that of \(\gamma_{\rm exp}\), it is remarkable that the largest discrepancy between the two sets of \(\lambda\) is found for LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(\lambda\!=\!0.1\) and \(1.1\)) where we observe a significant field dependence of the low-temperature normal-state heat capacity which may arise from spin fluctuations. For LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, A\({}_{\rm AD}\!=\!1.1\) appears to be of reasonable magnitude being in agreement with its coupling strength \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) (Fig. 9), while \(\lambda_{\rm tot}\!=\!0.1\) can be regarded as too small because not even \(\lambda\!\sim\!0.3\) can account for superconductivity above the mK regime using the phonon frequencies from Table 6.

The \(T_{c}\) reduction of LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with respect to the superconducting Ni compounds and the disappearance of superconductivity in LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is reflected in the variation of

\begin{table}

Figure 9: (a)–(d) Strong-coupling correction to the dimensionless BCS ratios (\(\Delta C\))\({}_{T}/\gamma T_{c}\), \(\Delta(0)/k_{B}T_{c}\), \(\gamma T_{c}^{2}/H_{c}^{2}(0)\), and \(h_{c}(0)\) as a function of the strong-coupling variable \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(\square\)), LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(\triangle\)), and LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(\Diamond\)).

  \(\hat{\alpha}^{2}\!=\!(1/2)\lambda\,\hat{\omega}_{1}\). Although it is difficult to disentangle the phononic and electronic contribution one can use the relation \(\lambda\!=\!N(E_{f})\langle I^{2}\rangle/(M\,\hat{\omega}_{2}^{2})\) for a qualitative discussion (with \(\langle I^{2}\rangle\) the average of the electron-phonon matrix elements and \(M\) the mean atomic mass). The denominator, a phonon quantity, varies for these four compounds only by about 10% and is similar to the relative variation of \(\lambda\)\({}_{\rm AD}\) for the three superconducting compounds which implies that the nominator, the electronic Hopfield parameter \(\eta\), remains approximately constant for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, although \(\gamma\) of the latter is by 65% smaller than \(\gamma\) of the two other superconductors. Hence, the softening of the low-frequency modes, represented by \(\omega_{\rm ln}\), has a detrimental effect upon \(T_{c}\) of LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. On the other hand, the disappearance of superconductivity in LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C may be associated with the reduced DOS at \(E_{f}\), since the overall feature of our model phonon spectra is rather similar for LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.

In this context it is of interest that Mattheiss _et al.[33]_ attributed the superconducting properties to an electron-phonon mechanism in which high-frequency boron \(A_{1g}\) phonons couple strongly to an energy band of the Ni-B-C manifold whose position is sensitive to the geometry of the NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedron and modulate the Ni-B-Ni bond angle. It is proposed that superconductivity occurs only when a special \(s\!-\!p\) band is optimally aligned to \(E_{f}\) which happens to occur for nearly ideal NiB\({}_{4}\) angles in YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C concomitant with a high DOS at \(E_{f}\). As a result of the deviation from the idealized structure due to the larger La ionic radius with respect to Lu or Y the relevant \(s\!-\!p\) band is shifted to higher energies yielding a reduction of \(N(E_{f})\) by \(-47\%\) for LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with respect to LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. This is in agreement with the experiment where we observe a reduction of \(-57\%\) (see Table 1). However, the low characteristic frequencies \(\hat{\omega}_{1}\) and \(\omega_{\rm ln}\) (Table 6), derived from our model phonon spectra which provides a satisfactory description of the strong-coupling corrections, seem to contradict the suggestion of Mattheiss _et al.[33]_ that the mechanism for superconductivity is based on high-frequency boron \(A_{1g}\) optical phonons with energies equivalent to 1200 K.

### The upper critical field

In order to quantitatively examine the upward curvature of \(H_{c2}(T)\) we plot in Fig. 10 the normalized upper critical field \(h_{c2}(T)\!=\!H_{c2}(T)/(T_{c}dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_{c}}\) as a function of the reduced temperature \(t\!=\!T/T_{c}\) together with the weak-coupling result labeled as "BCS." From the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic and upper critical field (in Figs. 3 and 4) one obtains the normalized ratio \(k(T)\!=\!\kappa_{1}(T)/\kappa_{1}(T_{c})\) of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \(\kappa_{1}(T)\!=\!H_{c2}(T)/\sqrt{2}H_{c}(T)\) displayed in the inset of Fig. 10. The data of LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C are close to the BCS result but exhibit considerable scatter and are therefore not shown. The extrapolated values for \(k(0)\!=\!\kappa_{1}(0)/\kappa_{1}(T_{c})\) are about 1.5(1), 2.0(1), and 1.3(3) for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, respectively. The former two are significantly enhanced with respect to the weak-coupling ("BCS") result in the clean limit (1.26). Carbotte[16] showed that \(h_{c2}(0)\) and \(k(0)\) follow approximate relations that contain the strong-coupling correction \((T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln})^{2}\!\ln(\omega_{\rm ln}/bT_{c})\) in a similar way to Eqs. (10)\(-\)(13) for the dimensionless BCS ratios. A comparison of \(k(0)\) with the data compiled in Ref. [16] of a large number of electron-phonon-mediated superconductors, which are in the range \(0\!<\!T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\!<\!\)0.2 for \(1.2\!<\!k(0)\!<\!1.8\) shows that \(k(0)\!=\!1.5\) yields \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) of about 0.15 for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C while a remarkably high \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\!>\!\)0.2 would be required to account for \(k(0)\!\approx\!2\) of LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. Both values are significantly higher than the rather consistent \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) values derived from the four dimensionless ratios [Eqs. (10)\(-\)(13)] ranging between 0.06 and 0.1. Not even very strong coupling can account for the pronounced upward curvature and enhancement of \(h_{c2}(0)\) for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C which is reminiscent of a calculation using a \(\delta\)-function-based phonon spectrum with \(T_{c}/\omega_{E}\!\approx\!1\) (Ref. [16]) where \(\omega_{E}\) is the Einstein frequency of the \(\delta\) function. However, a dominant Einstein frequency at about 15 K is not compatible with the specific-heat data from which we obtain \(\Theta_{E1}\!=\!117\) K as the low-frequency Einstein mode for LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C.

Although various properties in the superconducting state of these borocarbides can be explained rather consistently with the model phonon spectra, the significant upturn of \(h_{c2}(0)\) and the enhancement of the normalized Ginzburg-Landau parameter remain to be resolved.

## V Conclusion

We determined the thermodynamic BCS ratios of YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C from specific-heat measurements and deduced according to their deviation from the weak-coupling BCS values the strong-coupling correction in terms of \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) .

From the normal-state specific heat between 2 and 300 K of these superconductors and the nonsuperconducting reference compounds LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) we constructed model phonon spectra yielding the moments of the phonon density of states \(F(\omega)\). A remarkable reduction of the high-frequency modes is obtained for YCo\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) with respect to the borocarbides investigated due to the missing carbon atoms in

Figure 10: Normalized upper critical field \(h_{c2}(T)\!=\!H_{c2}(T)/(T_{c}dH_{c2}/dT)_{Tc}\) as a function of the reduced temperature \(T/T_{c}\) for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LaPt\({}_{1.5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C; inset: normalized Ginzburg-Landau parameter for YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C; dashed lines: weak-coupling BCS result for a comparison.

  the former. The model phonon spectra of the superconducting compounds YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, and LaPt\({}_{1,5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C are (with the exception of a softening of the low-frequency modes of the latter) essentially the same as for nonsuperconducting LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. The former three compounds can be classified as moderately strong coupled superconductors since the electron-phonon enhancement parameter \(\lambda\) derived from the Allen and Dynes formula ranges between 0.95 and 1.15.

The difference between these \(\lambda\) values and those deduced from \(\gamma_{\rm exp}/\gamma_{\rm band}\) shows that band-structure calculations overestimate \(N(E_{f})\) in particular for LaPt\({}_{1,5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and that electron-electron correlations may be important. As the \(\lambda\) values from the Allen and Dynes formula are of the same magnitude for the three superconducting compounds, the lower \(T_{c}\) of LaPt\({}_{1,5}\)Au\({}_{0.5}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is suggested to be associated with the softening of the low-frequency modes, while the disappearance of superconductivity in LaNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C may be attributed to the smaller \(\gamma\) value reduced by about 50% with respect to those of YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. This reduction of \(N(E_{f})\) is in agreement with band-structure calculations and was attributed to the deviation from the ideal NiB\({}_{4}\) tetrahedral angle by Mattheiss _et al._[33] For YNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C and especially LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C our data reveal an anomalous upward curvature of \(H_{c2}(T)\) and \(\kappa_{1}(T)/\kappa_{1}(T_{c})\) which cannot be described in terms of the strong-coupling corrections \(T_{c}/\omega_{\rm ln}\) and remains to be resolved.
