###### Abstract

In-plane (\(r_{b}\)) and out-of-plane (\(r_{c}\)) resistivities of Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-_d_ have been determined using the electrical contact configuration of the dc flux transformer. \(r_{a}\)(_x_) varies nonmonotonically with _x_: \(r_{c}\)(_x_) increases at low \(x\), reaches a maximum at \(x\)  0.42, and then decreases for higher values of \(x\). In contrast, \(r_{b}\)(_x_) increases monotonically with \(x\). These results, along with the coexistence of metallic \(r_{b}\) and semiconducting \(r_{c}\), are consistent with the presence of a gap in the energy spectrum of the CuO chains, leading to tunneling through both valence and conduction bands of the CuO chains. [S0163-1829(97)52306-X]

Some of the more interesting and striking aspects of the normal-state resistivity of the high-temperature superconductors are the coexistence of metallic in-plane resistivity \(r_{b}\)(_T_) and semiconducting out-of-plane resistivity \(r_{c}\)(_T_) at low temperatures in a certain range of doping, and the transformation of both resistivities from metallic to insulating in the strongly underdoped regime.1 This behavior is observed in several underdoped cuprates and is typified by oxygen deficient YBa2Cu3O7,2 where \(r_{b}\), \(r_{c}\), and the anisotropy _r__c_/_r__ab_ increase _monotonically_ with decreasing \(y\). In YBa2Cu3O7, the removal of oxygen from the CuO chains has a twofold effect on \(r_{c}\): one is the reduction of the number of holes on the CuO2 planes through hole filling and their subsequent localization, the other is the drastic change of the condition for tunneling between the neighboring bilayers due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies on the chains. Consequently, one is unable to separate the effect on \(r_{c}\) of hole filling and localization on the planes from that of the depletion of the chain layers. It is important to clarify the relationship between the _c_-axis transport and the transformation of the CuO2 planes from metallic to insulating (a process intimately related to superconductivity) since one of the fundamental questions about the _c_-axis transport is its implications for superconductivity of the layered cuprates.

We address this issue through resistivity measurements of fully oxygenated Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-_d_ in which \(T_{c}\) can be continuously "tuned" from 92 to 0 K by increasing the Pr concentration. The Y-Pr sheets, which serve as "internal" charge reservoirs, are located inside the CuO2 bilayers and, as shown by optical reflectivity measurements,3 do not affect the structure and composition of the blocking layers, which include the CuO chains. Therefore, the _c_-axis resistivity of Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-_d_ changes only as a result of the transformations that take place in the conduction mechanism of the CuO2 planes, while the structure of the CuO chains remains unaffected.

Our principal finding is that the evolution of \(r_{c}\) is profoundly different in this system than in YBa2Cu3O7. In Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7, \(r_{c}\)(_x_) and the anisotropy \(r_{c}\)(_x_)/_r__ab_(_x_) are _nonmonotonic_ functions of _x_: at low to moderate \(x\), \(r_{c}\)(_x_) and \(r_{c}\)(_x_)/_r__ab_(_x_) increase, reaching a maximum at \(x\)  0.42; for even higher \(x\) values, \(r_{c}\)(_x_) and \(r_{c}\)(_x_)/_r__ab_(_x_) _decrease_, while \(r_{b}\)(_x_) continues to increase monotonically. In the samples with low Pr concentration both resistivities are metallic; more heavily doped samples exhibit metallic \(r_{b}\)(_T_) and semiconducting \(r_{c}\)(_T_), while both resistivities of the strongly underdoped crystals (very low \(T_{c}\) or nonsuperconducting) are semiconducting at low temperatures. As discussed subsequently, the nonmonotonic evolution of \(r_{c}\)(_x_) and the coexistence of metallic \(r_{b}\)(_T_) and semiconducting \(r_{c}\)(_T_) are consistent with the _c_-axis charge transport produced by tunneling between a neighboring bilayer and chain-layer, provided there is a gap in the energy spectrum of the CuO chains, so that, in heavily doped Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-_d_ tunneling takes place in the tails of the Fermi distribution.

Single crystals of Y1-_x_Pr_xBa2Cu3O7-_d_ with 0.13  0.55 and 0  \(T_{c}\) 0  85 K were grown by a method described elsewhere.4 Typical sizes of the crystals are 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.04 mm3, with the _c_-axis oriented along the smallest dimension. Eight electrodes were fabricated on each sample by bonding 1 mil Au wires to the crystal with Ag paste. The typical contact resistance of a completed electrode is 1.8 O or less. The distance between the voltage leads is about 1/3 of the length of the crystal.

We determined the resistivities \(r_{c}\)(_T_,_x_) and \(r_{b}\)(_T_,_x_) using the electrical contact configuration of the dc flux transformer [inset to Fig. 1(a) shows the configuration of the leads]. A 0.1 mA current biases the top face of the crystal and the voltages on the top (_V_top) and bottom (_V_bot) faces are recorded as a function of temperature.5-7 The two-dimensional distribution of the electrical potential _V_(_x_,_z_) inside the crystal is determined by Laplace's equation \({\rm div}\tilde{j}(x,z) = \rho_{ab}^{- 1}\tilde{\sigma}^{2}Vl\partial x^{2} + \rho_{c}^{- 1}\tilde{\sigma}^{2}Vl\partial z^{2} = 0\), where \(\tilde{j}(x,z)\) is the current density.7 A general solution is given by an infinite series with the coefficients determined from the boundary conditions. For the voltage drop on the bottom face of the crystal, we obtained the following _rapidly_ converging series:

\[V_{\rm bot} = \frac{8I(\rho_{c}\rho_{ab})^{1/2}}{\pi b}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{( -1)^{k}}{2k + 1}\,\frac{\sin[(2k + 1)\,\pi d/2L]}{\sinh[(2k + 1)\,\xi\pi D/L]}\,,\]

where \(\xi = (\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab})^{1/2}\), \(I\) is the applied current, \(b\), \(L\), and \(D\) are the width, length, and thickness of the sample, respectively, and \(d\) is the distance between the two voltage contacts.

In contrast, the voltage distribution on the top face is given by a very _slowly_ converging series. The same type of problem appears in the Montgomery method.[8, 9] We solved it by separating the series into slowly and rapidly converging parts. The former is chosen in such a way that it does not depend on \(\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\) and can be calculated exactly [the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2)], while the rapidly converging series can be easily evaluated numerically. Then,

\[V_{\rm top} = \frac{8I(\rho_{c}\rho_{ab})^{1/2}}{\pi b}\Bigg{[}\frac{1}{2}\, \ln\,\tan\Bigg{(}\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{\pi d}{4L}\Bigg{)}\] (2) \[+\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{2k + 1}\,\sin\,\frac{(2k + 1)\,\pi d}{2L}\] \[\times \Bigg{\langle}\coth\frac{(2k + 1)\,\xi\pi D}{L}-1\Bigg{\rangle}\Bigg{]}\]

For our Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) samples, the parameter \(\xi\pi D/L\)\(\geq 1\,(V_{\rm top}/V_{\rm bot}\)\(\approx 1)\). Even for these relatively small values of anisotropy, it was sufficient to retain only the first three terms (\(k = 0\),1,2) in Eqs. (1) and (2) to obtain convergence within 0.1%.[10]

Special care was taken to ensure that our results reflect bulk properties and are not affected by extrinsic factors such as sample inhomogeneities or surface quality. Two sets of measurements were performed for each sample in which the current was injected through leads 1,4 and 5,8, respectively. The corresponding sets of \(V_{\rm top}\), \(V_{\rm bot}\) were compared, and, after correcting for small differences in the spacing between the contacts, only those crystals for which both the corresponding sets of \(V_{\rm top}\), \(V_{\rm bot}\) were within 10% of each other were retained for the analysis.

In-plane and out-of-plane resistivities of five Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) single crystals are shown in Fig. 1. The magnitude and temperature dependences of \(\rho_{ab}\) [Fig. 1(a)] are very similar to those obtained by a four-point method on a different set of Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) single crystals with current leads mounted on their edges.[11] This fact corroborates the correctness of our algorithm. Figure 1(a) shows that \(\rho_{ab}\)(\(T\),\(x\)) is metallic for \(x\)\(\approx\)0.42 [i.e., \(\rho_{ab}\)(\(T\))\(\propto\)\(\tau_{ab}^{-1}\)\(\sim\)\(T\)\(+\) const] and increases monotonically with increasing Pr content. The sample with \(x\)\(=\)0.42 exhibits early signs of weak localization which indicates that the mobility threshold \(E_{c}\) is close to the Fermi energy of this sample. The samples with \(x\)\(>\)0.42 display a semiconducting-type behavior of \(\rho_{ab}\)(\(T\)) at low \(T\). As in all underdoped cuprates, there is a characteristic change of slope \(d\rho_{ab}/dT\) at temperatures \(T^{\rm st}\)(\(x\)) marked by arrows.[12] This feature is discussed in Ref. 13.

As shown in Fig. 1(b), the evolution of \(\rho_{c}(x,T)\) is quite surprising. With increasing Pr concentration, Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) exhibits a nonmonotonic variation of \(p_{c}(x)\): for low values of \(x\), it increases, reaching a maximum for \(x\)\(\sim\)0.42, while for even higher Pr concentration, \(p_{c}(x,T)\)_decreases_ even though it remains semiconducting. This effect can be illustrated even more dramatically by plotting the anisotropy \(\rho_{c}/\rho_{ab}\) as a function of \(x\) at a given temperature [inset to Fig. 1(b)]. Notice that the anistropy is strongly temperature-dependent in the sample with the highest anisotropy (\(x\)\(=\)0.42), in contrast to optimally doped YBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (Ref. 14) and strongly underdoped \(Y_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (\(x\)\(=\)0.53 and 0.55) samples.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) also show that both \(\rho_{ab}\)(\(T\)) and \(\rho_{c}(T)\) of the \(x\)\(=\)0.13 and 0.22 samples are metallic down to \(T_{c}\). The \(x\)\(=\)0.42 sample exhibits a coexistence of metallic \(\rho_{ab}\)(\(T\)) and semiconducting \(\rho_{c}(T)\) at all \(T\)\(>\)\(T_{c}\) . The strongly underdoped samples (\(x\)\(=\)0.53 and 0.55) exhibit a minimum in \(\rho_{ab}\)(\(T\)) and semiconducting \(\rho_{c}(T)\). Hence, the major features of the resistivity of Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{x}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) are the nonmonotonic evolution of \(\rho_{c}(T)\) with Pr content, the transformation of both resistivities from metallic to semiconducting, and the coexistence of metallic \(\rho_{ab}\)(\(T\)) and semiconducting \(\rho_{c}(T)\) for a certain range of doping.

In a short paper it is difficult to give due credit to many ingenious models of the \(c\)-axis transport that have been proposed (see Ref. 1). None, however, have anticipated the nonmonotonic evolution of \(\rho_{c}(x)\) in the underdoped regime. We

  present here a simple model which attempts to incorporate the main features we described above. Figure 2 illustrates the basic idea of our model. The main contribution to the _c_-axis conductivity is assumed to be due to the incoherent elastic tunneling between the neighboring CuO\({}_{2}\) bilayer and the CuO chain layer. Then, the transformation of \(\rho_{c}(T)\) from metallic to semiconducting and its nonmonotonic evolution can be understood if we assume that there is a gap \(\Delta\) in the energy spectrum of the chains. The magnitude and temperature dependence of \(\rho_{c}(T)\) is determined by the location of the chemical potential with respect to the valence and conduction bands of the chains as follows: when the chemical potential lies below the gap, in the valence band, the chains are metallic and so is \(\rho_{c}(T)\); when the Fermi energy enters the gap, tunneling takes place only in the tails of the Fermi distribution through both valence and conduction bands of the chains leading to a semiconducting-type temperature dependence of \(\rho_{c}(T)\) characterized by two activation energies, \(\mu\) and \(\Delta-\mu\) (the maximum value of \(\rho_{c}\) and the strongest temperature dependence corresponding to \(\mu\) lying in the midgap region); when \(\mu\) is raised above midgap level, the _c_-axis conductivity increases due to enhanced current through the conduction band, and at low temperatures \(\rho_{c}(T)\) is governed by the smaller of the two activation energies \(\Delta-\mu\). We see that the monotonic change in the position of the chemical potential leads to a nonmonotonic variation of \(\rho_{c}\).

To test the applicability of this phenomenological model to the Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) system, we fit our experimental data of all five samples [15] with the following equation for conductivity [16, 17]:

\[\sigma_{c}\!=\!\frac{a\,\tau_{ab}}{e^{\beta\mu}\!+\!1}+\frac{b}{e^{\beta( \Delta-\mu)}\!+\!1}\!\equiv\!\!\sigma_{1}\!+\sigma_{2}\,,\] (3)

where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, \(\beta\!=\!1/k_{B}T\), \(\sigma_{1}\) and \(\sigma_{2}\) are the contributions to \(\sigma_{c}\) from tunneling through the valence and conduction bands, respectively, and \(\mu\) is measured from the top of the valence band; we take the relaxation rate \(\tau_{ab}^{-1}\!\propto\!\tau_{r}^{-1}\!+\!T\), where \(\tau_{r}^{-1}\!=\!\)const is the elastic scattering rate. The fits to \(\rho_{c}(T)\) are shown in Fig. 1(b), while the values of \(\mu(x)\) and \(\Delta\) obtained from the fitting are shown in Fig. 3. The energy gap \(\Delta\!=\!\)670 K was kept constant during the fitting procedure for all five samples. As shown in Fig. 3, for \(x\!=\!0.13\) and 0.22, the chemical potential is in the valence band (\(\mu\!<\!0\)) and, therefore, according to Eq. (3), \(\rho_{c}(T)\) is metallic, i.e., \(\rho_{c}(T)\!\propto\!\rho_{ab}(T)\!\propto\!\tau_{ab}^{-1}\). When \(\mu(x)\) enters the gap (0\(<\!\mu\!<\!E_{c}\)), \(\rho_{c}(T)\) becomes semiconducting with two activation energies, \(\mu\) and \(\Delta-\mu\), while \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) remains metallic. Finally, when \(\mu\) is elevated above \(E_{c}\), both \(\rho_{ab}(T)\) and \(\rho_{c}(T)\) become semiconducting at low temperatures, but with different activation energies: \(\mu\!-\!E_{c}\) and \(\Delta-\mu\), respectively.

The solid line in Fig. 3 is a linear fit to \(\mu(x)\) data which gives a slope \(d\,\mu/dx\!=\!\)1800 K. An analysis of the in-plane resistivity of the Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) crystals from a entirely different prospective yields a very close value of \(d\,\mu/dx\!=\!\)1760 K [13]. According to Fig. 3, for \(x\!>\!0.6\), the chemical potential enters the conduction band making chains "metallic" again, at least in the sense that there is a finite density of states at the Fermi level. This conclusion is corroborated by the evidence of "metallic" chains and insulating planes in aligned films of PrBa\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\)[18].

Our model indicates a monotonic increase of the chemical potential with Pr content at an approximately constant rate. This can be easily understood in terms of a hole depletion and subsequent localization process due to a valence of Pr greater than 3. In spite of many experiments, there is no consensus on the nature of the suppression of superconductivity by Pr doping in the Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) mainly because the chemical valence of Pr remains uncertain. While susceptibility, Hall effect, and neutron-diffraction crystallographic studies indicate that Pr valence is greater than 3, high-energy spectroscopy and band structure calculations indicate an oxidation state Pr\({}^{3+,19}\) Recent optical reflectivity results [3] and calculations by Fehrenbacher and Rice [20] support the hole depletion mechanism. Reference 20 shows that the total probability of the 4\(f^{1}\)Pr configuration is roughly 0.15-0.2 which may explain the spectroscopic results revealing a

The effect of Pr on \(T_{c}\) suppression and conduction in Bi\({}_{2}\)Sr\({}_{2}\)(Ca\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\))Cu\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{8+\delta}\), where hole filling by Pr clearly takes place, is similar to that in Y\({}_{1-x}\)Pr\({}_{x}\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\)[21]. This also points toward the hole filling and subsequent localization scenario.

The notion that tunneling in the \(c\) direction takes place in the tails of the Fermi distribution is similar to that proposed by Abrikosov.[16] However, unlike Ref. [16], we believe that in the fully oxygenated \(R\)Ba\({}_{2}\)Cu\({}_{3}\)O\({}_{7-\delta}\) (\(R\) = rare earth) compounds, this is due to the gap in the density of states (DOS) of the chain layers and not the presence of resonant tunneling centers. In other cuprates that do not possess metallic chains in the blocking layers and are much more anisotropic, the resonant centers may play a role in the \(c\)-direction transport.
