The x-ray diffraction data in the lower-pressure region were also obtained with a wavelength of \(\lambda=0.4112\) A. The electrical resistance measurements of Ca were separately performed up to 216 GPa without a pressure-transmitting medium with diamond anvils having a 50-300 \(\mu\)m beveled culet. We aligned the electrodes made of platinum foil in a four-probe configuration. The insulating layer on the Re gasket was made from Al2O3 without any binder to prevent chemical reactions. The electrical resistance was measured by using an ac resistance bridge (LR-700) with a 3 \(\mu\)A excitation current.

Selected x-ray diffraction patterns obtained under a compression process at SPring-8 are shown in Fig. 1. The peaks marked with an asterisk represent the diffraction from a Re metal gasket. Ca shows phase transitions from phase Ca-V to Ca-VI as pressure increases up to 172 GPa in Fig. 1(b). The reflections were all assigned to the phase Ca-V and Ca-VI.[16, 17, 18, 19] Figure 1(a) shows the x-ray diffraction data above 183 GPa and the structural phase transition from phase Ca-VI at around 210 GPa. Distinguishing reflections with arrows appear at around 2\(\theta\) = 12.2 and 15.3 degrees. We named this phase "Ca-VII." We can see from Fig. 1(a) that the relative intensity of the diffraction lines changed slightly after the transition. At 229 GPa, the diffraction pattern of the single phase of the Ca-VII phase is obtained. In Fig. 2, the pressure dependence of the \(d\) value for each line is shown up to 241 GPa. It is also clear from the dependence that a structural phase transition occurs around 210 GPa.

The pressure dependence of electrical resistance [\(R(P)\)] at room temperature is shown in Fig. 3. The main features of \(R(P)\) are consistent with our previous report.[2] Structural phase transitions affect the \(R(P)\) curve; for example, the sudden increase and decrease around 110 and 140 GPa indicates phase transitions Ca-III \(\rightarrow\) Ca-IV (at 113 GPa from powder x-ray diffraction) and Ca-IV \(\rightarrow\) Ca-V (at 139 GPa), respectively. The resistance was nearly independent of pressure from 160 to 190 GPa in Ca-VI. Above 190 GPa, a rapid increase in resistance was observed. This increase indicates a start of the phase

  transition from Ca-VI to Ca-VII. Furthermore, the increase was nearly saturated from about 210 GPa, and the pressure was consistent with the results of x-ray diffraction. Therefore, we can claim that the electrical resistance measurement above 210 GPa was performed at Ca-VII.

The temperature dependence of electrical resistance [_R_(_T_)] up to 216 GPa is shown in Fig. 4. The pressure was determined at room temperature and at low temperature (i.e., around 20 K) by the diamond Raman method using the calibration curve proposed by Akahama and Kawamura.[23] The pressure change during temperature cycle was smaller than 5 GPa. In Fig. 4, we show the pressure determined at low temperature. The superconducting transition shifts to low temperature only once at 149 GPa and then shifts to high temperature continuously with the application of pressures above 160 GPa. At around 190 GPa, a clear step was observed in the superconducting transition. This step indicates the coexistence of two phases, Ca-VI and Ca-VII, and began to disappear with increasing pressure. Finally, no step was observed at 216 GPa. Therefore, the major part of the sample already transitioned to Ca-VII and the superconductivity at 216 GPa is assignable to Ca-VII.

\(T_{\rm c}\) at each pressure was determined from the onset of the drop as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. We defined the onset as the temperature at which the resistance curve starts to deviate from the linear temperature dependence. We used the same definition of \(T_{\rm c}\) as in our previous work to compare the results. This definition reflects \(T_{\rm c}\) at the highest pressure region in the sample. The magnetic field dependence of _R_(_T_) is also shown in the inset. The _R_(_T_) curves at 0 and 2 T deviated from each other below the determined \(T_{\rm c}\) onset. The pressure dependence of the , onset is shown in Fig. 5 with the pressure dependence obtained in previous work,[2] and the phase diagram is determined by x-ray diffraction at room temperature. Observed \(T_{\rm c}\) onsets in this work were somewhat lower than that in previous works; however, tendencies in the pressure dependence of \(T_{\rm c}\) onset [\(T_{\rm c}\)(_P_)] were the same. The \(T_{\rm c}\) onset in Ca-V is lower than that in neighboring phases and the \(T_{\rm c}\) onset around 25 K at 160 GPa is assignable to Ca-VI, which corresponds to Ishikawa's suggestion.[21]

In Ca-VI, the \(T_{\rm c}\) onset continuously increased as pressure increased. At 216 GPa, the highest pressure in this work, the \(T_{\rm c}\) onset reached 29 K in Ca-VII. The x-ray diffraction pattern of Ca-VII is similar to that in Ba-IV and Sr-V, which have a host-guest structure. It is suggested that Ca-VII also has a host-guest structure. Full analysis of the crystal structure using our x-ray diffraction pattern in Ca-VII is now being performed by Fujihisa.[24] Preliminary results of the crystal structure analysis suggested that Ca-VII has the host-guest structure theoretically predicted by Ishikawa _et al._ and Arapan _et al.[21, 22]_ We claim that the crystal structure at low temperature is the same as that at room temperature because no anomalies in the _R_(_T_) curve were observed from low temperature to room temperature. The \(T_{\rm c}\) onset in Ca-VII suggested that Ca has the highest \(T_{\rm c}\) onset in phases with a host-guest structure, which is the same as for the other alkaline-earth metals, Ba and Sr.

In summary, we succeeded in electrical resistance and x-ray diffraction measurements of Ca under pressures above 200 GPa. We found a structural phase transition from Ca-VI to Ca-VII, which may possibly have a host-guest structure. Furthermore, we have observed a \(T_{\rm c}\) onset of Ca at 29 K at 216 GPa in Ca-VII.
