###### Abstract

Structural and superconducting behavior of samples prepared with the nominal compositions of Nd1.0S(Ba1-_R_T_)1.9SCu3O7+_d_ has been investigated by neutron-diffraction and dc magnetization measurements. Neutron data refined by the Reitveld method showed that there is mixing of the rare-earth (_R_) ions with a substantial fraction of the Pr going to the normal R site in the _R_Ba2Cu3O7+_d_ type structure and a corresponding fraction of the Nd going to the Ba site. Structural changes due to the trivalent R ions going to the Ba site are very similar to those observed in the Nd1+_a_Ba2-_Cu3O7+_d_ (Nd123ss), indicating that Pr behaves like other trivalent _R_'s on the divalent Ba site. Magnetization measurements show that the depression in T_{c} is more pronounced for the Pr bearing samples than that for Nd123ss for the same number of trivalent ions on the Ba site. However, by correcting the changes in T_{c} for the depression associated with the fraction of Pr on the R site, the depression in T_{c} per trivalent ion on the divalent site is found to be identical to that in other light R123ss. Thus the depression in superconductivity in this series of samples is due to two independent effects: (1) Pr on the R site and (2) hole localization due to trivalent R ions on the Ba site. In this respect, Pr on the Ba site appears to behave like all the other trivalent R ions. [S0163-1829(97)03934-9]

## I Introduction

Unlike YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (Y123) which forms only as a stoichiometric compound, the light rare-earth elements (_R_) form a solid solution, with increasing substitution of the R3+ for the Ba2+ with increasing ionic radii of the R.1.2 Additions of excess light rare-earth elements in R1+_2Ba 2-_Cu3O7+_d_ (_R_123ss) result in oxygen defects on the anti-chain sites.25 In the Nd1+_a_Ba2-_Cu3O7+_d_ (Nd123ss) system, Nd3+ has an ionic radius approaching Ba2+, allowing a high degree of solubility with Ba (_x_  0.8) without forming second phases.6 The superconducting properties of this system can be controlled via substitution of divalent Ba by trivalent Nd in addition to changing the oxygen stoichiometry. The depression in superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) for fully oxygenated samples has been shown to be due to hole localization caused by filling the antichain site with oxygen in order to balance charges in the system.7 In this case T_{c} depression is analogous to increasing d in the stoichiometric R123 compounds. However, T_{c} can also be depressed by substituting Pr for R in the R1-_R_Pr2Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_Pr123) systems.8 In this case, the mechanism for depression is not well understood. While it has been suggested that the valence of the Pr ion is 4+ causing the number of conducting holes to decrease when tetravalent Pr ions are substituted on the trivalent rare-earth (_R_) sites,9 considerable evidence indicates that Pr is trivalent in these materials.10 Furthermore, electron-energy-loss spectroscopy measurements show that the total hole concentration in the (_R_,Pr)123 system does not change as the content of Pr increases.11 It has also been suggested that strong hybridization of the Pr 4f states with O p orbitals destroys superconductivity.12 This model, however, fails to explain the superconductivity which was found in thin-film Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7.13

In this study, we investigate the role of nominally substituting Pr onto the Ba sites in samples prepared with the nominal compositions of Nd1.0S(Ba1-_R_)2.9SCu3O7+_d_. If Pr is a well behaved trivalent ion, and if all of the Pr remains on the Ba site, the suppression of T_{c} should be similar to that caused by Nd. Since Pr3+ is slightly larger than Nd3+ in size (1.013 A vs 0.995 A), there should be a preference for Pr to go to the Ba site compared to Nd based solely on lattice strain arguments. However, this preference is not large, so there is expected to be some site mixing of the two _R_'s. If Pr tends toward the tetravalent state (0.90 A), the Pr occupancy on the R site should be favored. For this reason, neutron-diffraction studies were performed to determine the relative site preferences of the Nd and Pr ions. dc magnetization measurements were performed to study the effect of Pr on the superconducting transition temperature.

## II Experimental technique

### Sample preparation

Nd2O3 and BaCO3 were dried at 1000 and 750 degC for 24 h, respectively. Pr6O11 was dried at 900 degC for 24 h and at 400 degC for 24 h to insure the formation of stoichiometric Pr6O11. In order to fully oxidize CuO, it was dried at 550 degC for 5 days. Samples were made using conventional solid-state reactions. Nd1.0S(Ba1-_R_T_)1.9SCu3O7+_d_ was prepared by mixing and heating appropriate amounts of Nd2O3, Pr6O11, BaCO3, and CuO powders at 880 degC in air twice, then annealing at 940 degC in 100% O2 three times with grinding in between. Oxygenation was performed on ground powders (<38 um) at 450 degC for 24 h. Stoichiometric Nd123 was shown to be slightly overdoped with optimal doping occurring for 0.05 Nd on the Ba sites in the Nd123ss.5 For this reason, all samples in this study were synthesized using 1.05 Nd atoms per formula unit. Heat treatments were repeated until x-ray-diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) confirmed the formation of a single-phase solid solution.

At this stage, the samples contained phase pure (Nd,Pr)(Ba,Nd,Pr)2Cu3O7+_d_ solid solution. However, the degree of homogeneity of Nd or Pr throughout the entire sample is unknown since the driving force to form a solid solution is low. The only means of testing for short scale homogeneity (i.e., less than the coherence length) is to perform dc magnetization measurements and to look at both the magnitude of T_{c} as well as the sharpness of the superconducting transition. It was found that at least three anneals with intermediate grinding were necessary to insure homogeneity of the sample defined as a constant T_{c} and Meissner fraction between anneals.

### Characterization

X-ray-diffraction (XRD) analysis was done by a Philips diffractometer equipped with a vertical 2-_th_ goniometer and Cu _K_a_ radiator. Typical scanning rates were 0.05deg per step from 20deg to 130deg. Neutron-diffraction studies were performed at University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR). Data were collected at room temperature on powders which were ground and sieved to a particle size of less than 25 um. The neutron and XRD powder patterns were each refined by gsas program software.14 Differential thermal analysis was conducted with a Perkin-Elmer DTA 1700. The composition of the gases was controlled by a Sierra gas-flow controller. The gas-flow rate was 50 cc/min. The heating rate of the DTA furnace was set at 10 degC/min. The endothermic onset temperature was determined at the intersection point between the steepest tangent to the peak and the selected base line. A sample was not considered phase pure unless there were no discernible endothermic events before the peritectic decomposition (<2 wt. % CuO or BaCuO3 phases present).

Magnetic and superconducting properties of the sample were studied by a Quantum Design MPMS superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. Both field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization data were obtained in 10 Oe applied field to determine T_{c}.

## III Results and Discussion

### Neutron diffraction

Table 1 presents the refined cell parameters for the _R_(Ba1-_z_,R,_z_)Cu3O7+_d_ series of samples where R can be either Nd or Pr. The Nd:Pr ratio is fixed by initial chemistry, but the site occupations for Nd and Pr on both the R and Ba sites were allowed to vary and were refined by Rietveld analysis of the neutron-diffraction data. In addition, the oxygen occupation for both O1 (chain site) and O5 (antichain site) were determined in the same way. In the case of NdBa2Cu3O7-_d_, detailed analysis of Nd and Ba site occupancies showed that Ba does not go to the Nd site.4 Similarly, analysis on the Nd excess Nd123ss samples showed that Ba does not go to the Nd site, while excess Nd goes to the Ba site.7 Unfortunately, the neutron-scattering cross sections of Pr and Ba are very nearly the same and, therefore,

 these two cannot be distinguished uniquely. Therefore, in the subsequent analysis of site occupancies in the Nd 1.0s(Ba 1 - 2 2 Pr 1.9S Cu 3 0 7 + d samples, it was assumed that the Ba fully occupies its normal site. After fixing the Ba occupancy, the Pr and Nd occupancies were allowed to vary freely both at the rare-earth site and at the nominal Ba site with the condition that combined fractional occupancies at the rare-earth site add up to unity (i.e., full occupancy) and likewise, the Ba, Pr, and Nd fractional occupancies at the nominal Ba site also add up to unity. This procedure was uniformly adopted for all the samples which gives a meaningful and reliable variation of Pr and Nd occupancies at the two sites.

For samples with z < 0.125, the space group is _Pmmm_ (orthorhombic), while the structure collapsed to the tetragonal space group, _P4/mmm_, for higher substitutions of the trivalent rare earth for the divalent Ba ion. It should be recognized that O 1 and O 5 sites collapse to the O 1 site in tetragonal structure with a multiplicity of 2, while the O 2 and O 3 sites converge to the O 2. In Table 1, the atomic site designations were not changed to reflect this increase in symmetry. In the Nd123ss, the loss of orthorhombicity was shown to be due to oxygen filling of the antichain sites to compensate additional charge arriving from the trivalent R substituting for the divalent Ba. The neutron-diffraction data confirm that this also occurs in the nominal Pr doping of the Ba site.

### Structure

A composite plot of both neutron and XRD results shows that the c axis shortens with the increase in R on the Ba site (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the smaller R atom replacing the Ba atom. This change is nearly linear with z. Comparing the rate of change of the c axis with Nd on the Ba site for the Nd123ss, and that for the nominal Pr substitution on the Ba site, shows that there is little distinction between Nd and Pr substitution (Fig. 2). The average basal plane dimensions do not change with z for values less than 0.2. This would support the observation that the unit-cell volume change is primarily due to replacement of the larger Ba with the smaller R. The lack of clear distinction in the lattice contraction between nominal Pr on the Ba site and that of Nd on the Ba site supports the argument for the trivalent valence of the Pr since the difference in ionic radii between the Nd 3 + and Pr 3 + is <2%.

Gross structural observations show little distinction between Nd and Pr, indicating that on the crystal structure level, there is little difference between Nd and Pr on the Ba site. Yet, as will be discussed later, the Pr bearing samples behave quite differently magnetically and electronically. For this reason, we must delve deeper to look for structural anomalies.

Figure 3 shows that the ratio of Nd:Pr on the R site changes with increasing Pr. Again, note that the samples, purposefully synthesized with slight excess Nd. This was done since the stoichiometric Nd123 is not stable at high

  temperatures with 1 bar PO2 necessary to insure homogeneous single-phase samples. In addition, optimal doping for fully oxygenated Nd123ss occurs for excess Nd (_x_ ~ 0.05). The solid lines represent the random mixture of Nd and Pr at the R and Ba site. The neutron data show that the Nd prefers the R site over Pr compared to random mixing. Based on ionic size arguments alone, this is expected since the Nd is slightly smaller.

#### iii.2.2 Oxygen content

Rietveld refinement of the chain and antichain site oxygen occupancies indicates that the charge compensation is deficient in most samples (Fig. 4), even though a prolonged low-temperature (450 degC) oxygenation was performed on ground powders. This suggests that the distribution of trivalent ions on divalent sites is not random. Since only \frac{1}{2} of an oxygen is needed to balance charge of the trivalent ion on the Ba site, the distribution or the R on the Ba sites determines how much excess oxygen a sample can uptake. It was observed that, in the Nd123ss, for doping levels of 0.1<_x_ < 0.4, the T_{c} could be varied considerably depending on how the samples were processed.[3] Higher _T__c_'s were observed for samples annealed at high temperatures in 1% PO2. It was postulated that the lower oxygen partial pressure enhances the pairing of trivalent ions across antichain sites. Pairing would reduce the number of excess holes due to partially compensated oxygen on antichain sites and reduce hole localization due to hole robing by uncompensated trivalent ions on the Ba sites. The lack of complete charge compensation in the bulk suggests poor pairing of the trivalent ions on the Ba sites. This, however, is consistent with results from the Nd123ss samples prepared in a similar manner.[3]

#### iii.2.3 Buckling of the Cu-O plane

Guillaume _et al.[15]_ showed that the presence or absence of superconductivity in R 123 compounds correlated strongly with the buckling of the Cu-O planes (critical angle of 167.3deg). In the comparison between fully oxygenated Pr123 and the other superconducting R 123 stoichiometric compounds, it was shown that the contraction in the c axis is due

  to an increase in the puckering of the Cu-O planes resulting in a decrease in the Pr-O2/O3 distances.[15] In oxygen-deficient samples (\delta\sim1), the puckering was similar for all R123 compounds, including Pr123. Figure 5 shows that the buckling of the Cu-O planes increases both with Nd and Pr going to the Ba site and that this puckering is similar to that seen in oxygen-deficient samples. There is a strong correlation between the degree of puckering and loss of T_{c}, so whatever is causing the Cu-O planes to distort from the ideal configuration also appears to be affecting superconductivity. In addition, this puckering occurs with either the removal of oxygen from the chain sites or filling of the antichain oxygen sites, reiterating the structural similarities between removal of oxygen in stoichiometric R123 and substitution of the trivalent R for Ba.

### _Magnetization measurements_

The structural similarities between the oxygen-deficient R123 and the excess R123s extend to their electronic structure.[7] Not only does T_{c} drop with increasing \delta in R123 and with increase in x in R_{1+s}Ba_{2-s}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta}, the details of the suppression are also similar. This includes the plateau with a T_{c} near 90 K for low doping levels and a second plateau with a T_{c} near 50 K for intermediate doping levels where the orthorhombic/tetragonal transition occurs. However, this analog breaks down for the Pr-doped samples studied here. Figure 6 shows that, for a range of R123s samples (R is Nd, Sm, and Eu), T_{c} is nearly identical over a wide range of doping levels, diverging only at higher doping levels for reasons not fully understood. The Pr-doped samples, however, show a more precipitous and linear drop in T_{c} with Pr content. In addition to the drop in T_{c} , there is also a decrease in the Meissner fraction with increasing Pr content (Fig. 7). The drop in the Meissner fraction would suggest that a second, nonsuperconducting phase is forming. However, this is not borne out by the structural and DTA analysis.

It is well known that Pr on the R site in RPr123 compounds does suppress superconductivity. The neutron-diffraction analysis shows that a substantial fraction of the Pr is going to the R site in the compounds under investigation. If it is assumed that the depression in superconductivity in these samples is due to two independent effects, (1) Pr on the R site for whatever reason and (2) R on the Ba site resulting in hole localization, it should be possible to separate out these two effects if they can be measured independently. Figure 6 shows that for z<0.2, the depression in T_{c} is independent of R except for Pr-doped samples. On the other hand, structurally Pr on the Ba site appears to behave as any other R. If it is assumed that the enhanced suppression in T_{c} is solely due to the Pr on the R site, and we have accu

The fitted line is only to that set of samples processed most like the (Nd,Pr)(Ba[Nd,Pr])_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta} samples. The error bars on the (Nd,Pr)(Ba[Nd,Pr])_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta} samples (closed diamonds) is the first \sigma of the fitted neutron data. The difference in T_{c} of the (Nd,Pr)(Ba[Nd,Pr])_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta} samples from the fitted line is assumed to be due to hole localization from R on the Ba site.

  rately measured Pr occupancy on the R site, we need to only determine the functional dependence of _T_c_ Pr (_R_ site) to determine if Pr on the Ba site has any effect on _T_c.

#### Effect of T_{c} for Pr on R site

Figure 8 shows the suppression of _T_c due to Pr on the R site in Nd1.05-yPr3Ba1.95Cu3O7. Again, a slight excess of Nd on the Ba site was used to obtain optimal doping level for superconductivity. For the optimally doped samples, Pr depresses superconductivity in a systematic, linear fashion. There is some variance in _T_c depending on how the samples are prepared.[16] The _T_c's for Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)1.95Cu3O7+_d_ is plotted against the measured site occupancy of Pr on the R site from Table I and compared to the _T_c's for Nd1.05-yBa1.95Cu3O7 and its known site occupancies. Any deviation in _T_c from the ideal case of Pr alone on the R site must then be due to hole localization by the trivalent ions on the Ba site. Correcting the _T_c's shown in Fig. 6 for the effect of Pr on the R site (Fig. 8) shows that the corrected _T_c's for the Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)1.95Cu3O7+_d_ samples follow the same curve as the other R 123ss. This indicates, that at least to the first order, the suppression in superconductivity in the Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)1.95Cu3O7+_d_ system is due to two independent effects, one due to Pr on the R site and the other hole localization due to the effect of the trivalent ion on the divalent site. Recent work on the Eu(Ba1-zPr)2Cu3O7+_d_ system, where there is a larger difference in ionic radii between Eu and Pr, indicates that Pr shows a strong affinity to substitute at the larger Ba site and a much reduced depression in _T_c compared to that in the Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)7+_d_ set of samples.[17]

## IV Conclusions

In this study, we have investigated the role of nominally substituting Pr onto the Ba sites in samples prepared with the nominal compositions of Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)1.95Cu3O7+_d_. Neutron-diffraction data refined by the Rietveld method show that there is mixing of the R ions with a substantial fraction of the Pr going to the normal R site and some Nd going to the Ba site. Structural changes due to the trivalent R ions going to the Ba site are very similar to the Nd123ss, indicating that Pr behaves like other R on the Ba site. Magnetization measurements show that the depression in _T_c is more pronounced for the Pr bearing samples. However, on correcting the changes in _T_c for the fraction of Pr on the R site, this system also shows identical depression in _T_c as with other light R 123ss. Thus the depression in superconductivity in this set of samples is due to two independent effects: (1) Pr on the R site and (2) hole localization due to trivalent ions on the Ba site; Pr on the Ba site appears to behave like all the other trivalent R ions.

###### Abstract

Structural and superconducting behavior of samples prepared with the nominal compositions of Nd1.0S(Ba1-_R_T_)1.9SCu3O7+_d_ has been investigated by neutron-diffraction and dc magnetization measurements. Neutron data refined by the Reitveld method showed that there is mixing of the rare-earth (_R_) ions with a substantial fraction of the Pr going to the normal R site in the _R_Ba2Cu3O7+_d_ type structure and a corresponding fraction of the Nd going to the Ba site.

## I Introduction

Unlike YBa2Cu3O7-_d_ (Y123) which forms only as a stoichiometric compound, the light rare-earth elements (_R_) form a solid solution, with increasing substitution of the R3+ for the Ba2+ with increasing ionic radii of the R.1.2 Additions of excess light rare-earth elements in R1+_2Ba 2-_Cu3O7+_d_ (_R_123ss) result in oxygen defects on the anti-chain sites.25 In the Nd1+_a_Ba2-_Cu3O7+_d_ (Nd123ss) system, Nd3+ has an ionic radius approaching Ba2+, allowing a high degree of solubility with Ba (_x_  0.8) without forming second phases.6 The superconducting properties of this system can be controlled via substitution of divalent Ba by trivalent Nd in addition to changing the oxygen stoichiometry. The depression in superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}) for fully oxygenated samples has been shown to be due to hole localization caused by filling the antichain site with oxygen in order to balance charges in the system.7 In this case T_{c} depression is analogous to increasing d in the stoichiometric R123 compounds. However, T_{c} can also be depressed by substituting Pr for R in the R1-_R_Pr2Ba2Cu3O7-_d_ (_R_Pr123) systems.8 In this case, the mechanism for depression is not well understood. While it has been suggested that the valence of the Pr ion is 4+ causing the number of conducting holes to decrease when tetravalent Pr ions are substituted on the trivalent rare-earth (_R_) sites,9 considerable evidence indicates that Pr is trivalent in these materials.10 Furthermore, electron-energy-loss spectroscopy measurements show that the total hole concentration in the (_R_,Pr)123 system does not change as the content of Pr increases.11 It has also been suggested that strong hybridization of the Pr 4f states with O p orbitals destroys superconductivity.12 This model, however, fails to explain the superconductivity which was found in thin-film Pr0.5Ca0.5Ba2Cu3O7.13

In this study, we investigate the role of nominally substituting Pr onto the Ba sites in samples prepared with the nominal compositions of Nd1.0S(Ba1-_R_)2.9SCu3O7+_d_. If Pr is a well behaved trivalent ion, and if all of the Pr remains on the Ba site, the suppression of T_{c} should be similar to that caused by Nd. Since Pr3+ is slightly larger than Nd3+ in size (1.013 A vs 0.995 A), there should be a preference for Pr to go to the Ba site compared to Nd based solely on lattice strain arguments. However, this preference is not large, so there is expected to be some site mixing of the two _R_'s. If Pr tends toward the tetravalent state (0.90 A), the Pr occupancy on the R site should be favored. For this reason, neutron-diffraction studies were performed to determine the relative site preferences of the Nd and Pr ions. dc magnetization measurements were performed to study the effect of Pr on the superconducting transition temperature.

## II Experimental technique

### Sample preparation

Nd2O3 and BaCO3 were dried at 1000 and 750 degC for 24 h, respectively. Pr6O11 was dried at 900 degC for 24 h and at 400 degC for 24 h to insure the formation of stoichiometric Pr6O11. In order to fully oxidize CuO, it was dried at 550 degC for 5 days. Samples were made using conventional solid-state reactions. Nd1.0S(Ba1-_R_T_)1.9SCu3O7+_d_ was prepared by mixing and heating appropriate amounts of Nd2O3, Pr6O11, BaCO3, and CuO powders at 880 degC in air twice, then annealing at 940 degC in 100% O2 three times with grinding in between. Oxygenation was performed on ground powders (<38 um) at 450 degC for 24 h. Stoichiometric Nd123 was shown to be slightly overdoped with optimal doping occurring for 0.05 Nd on the Ba sites in the Nd123ss.5 For this reason, all samples in this study were synthesized using 1.05 Nd atoms per formula unit. Heat treatments were repeated until x-ray-diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) confirmed the formation of a single-phase solid solution.

At this stage, the samples contained phase pure (Nd,Pr)(Ba,Nd,Pr)2Cu3O7+_d_ solid solution. However, the degree of homogeneity of Nd or Pr throughout the entire sample is unknown since the driving force to form a solid solution is low. The only means of testing for short scale homogeneity (i.e., less than the coherence length) is to perform dc magnetization measurements and to look at both the magnitude of T_{c} as well as the sharpness of the superconducting transition. It was found that at least three anneals with intermediate grinding were necessary to insure homogeneity of the sample defined as a constant T_{c} and Meissner fraction between anneals.

### Characterization

X-ray-diffraction (XRD) analysis was done by a Philips diffractometer equipped with a vertical 2-_th_ goniometer and Cu _K_a_ radiator. Typical scanning rates were 0.05deg per step from 20deg to 130deg. Neutron-diffraction studies were performed at University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR). Data were collected at room temperature on powders which were ground and sieved to a particle size of less than 25 um. The neutron and XRD powder patterns were each refined by gsas program software.14 Differential thermal analysis was conducted with a Perkin-Elmer DTA 1700. The composition of the gases was controlled by a Sierra gas-flow controller. The gas-flow rate was 50 cc/min. The heating rate of the DTA furnace was set at 10 degC/min. The endothermic onset temperature was determined at the intersection point between the steepest tangent to the peak and the selected base line. A sample was not considered phase pure unless there were no discernible endothermic events before the peritectic decomposition (<2 wt. % CuO or BaCuO3 phases present).

Magnetic and superconducting properties of the sample were studied by a Quantum Design MPMS superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer. Both field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization data were obtained in 10 Oe applied field to determine T_{c}.

## III Results and Discussion

### Neutron diffraction

Table 1 presents the refined cell parameters for the _R_(Ba1-_z_,R,_z_)Cu3O7+_d_ series of samples where R can be either Nd or Pr. The Nd:Pr ratio is fixed by initial chemistry, but the site occupations for Nd and Pr on both the R and Ba sites were allowed to vary and were refined by Rietveld analysis of the neutron-diffraction data. In addition, the oxygen occupation for both O1 (chain site) and O5 (antichain site) were determined in the same way. In the case of NdBa2Cu3O7-_d_, detailed analysis of Nd and Ba site occupancies showed that Ba does not go to the Nd site.4 Similarly, analysis on the Nd excess Nd123ss samples showed that Ba does not go to the Nd site, while excess Nd goes to the Ba site.7 Unfortunately, the neutron-scattering cross sections of Pr and Ba are very nearly the same and, therefore,

 these two cannot be distinguished uniquely. Therefore, in the subsequent analysis of site occupancies in the Nd 1.0s(Ba 1 - 2 2 Pr 1.9S Cu 3 0 7 + d samples, it was assumed that the Ba fully occupies its normal site. After fixing the Ba occupancy, the Pr and Nd occupancies were allowed to vary freely both at the rare-earth site and at the nominal Ba site with the condition that combined fractional occupancies at the rare-earth site add up to unity (i.e., full occupancy) and likewise, the Ba, Pr, and Nd fractional occupancies at the nominal Ba site also add up to unity. This procedure was uniformly adopted for all the samples which gives a meaningful and reliable variation of Pr and Nd occupancies at the two sites.

For samples with z < 0.125, the space group is _Pmmm_ (orthorhombic), while the structure collapsed to the tetragonal space group, _P4/mmm_, for higher substitutions of the trivalent rare earth for the divalent Ba ion. It should be recognized that O 1 and O 5 sites collapse to the O 1 site in tetragonal structure with a multiplicity of 2, while the O 2 and O 3 sites converge to the O 2. In Table 1, the atomic site designations were not changed to reflect this increase in symmetry. In the Nd123ss, the loss of orthorhombicity was shown to be due to oxygen filling of the antichain sites to compensate additional charge arriving from the trivalent R substituting for the divalent Ba. The neutron-diffraction data confirm that this also occurs in the nominal Pr doping of the Ba site.

### Structure

A composite plot of both neutron and XRD results shows that the c axis shortens with the increase in R on the Ba site (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the smaller R atom replacing the Ba atom. This change is nearly linear with z. Comparing the rate of change of the c axis with Nd on the Ba site for the Nd123ss, and that for the nominal Pr substitution on the Ba site, shows that there is little distinction between Nd and Pr substitution (Fig. 2). The average basal plane dimensions do not change with z for values less than 0.2. This would support the observation that the unit-cell volume change is primarily due to replacement of the larger Ba with the smaller R. The lack of clear distinction in the lattice contraction between nominal Pr on the Ba site and that of Nd on the Ba site supports the argument for the trivalent valence of the Pr since the difference in ionic radii between the Nd 3 + and Pr 3 + is <2%.

Gross structural observations show little distinction between Nd and Pr, indicating that on the crystal structure level, there is little difference between Nd and Pr on the Ba site. Yet, as will be discussed later, the Pr bearing samples behave quite differently magnetically and electronically. For this reason, we must delve deeper to look for structural anomalies.

Figure 3 shows that the ratio of Nd:Pr on the R site changes with increasing Pr. Again, note that the samples, purposefully synthesized with slight excess Nd. This was done since the stoichiometric Nd123 is not stable at high

  temperatures with 1 bar PO2 necessary to insure homogeneous single-phase samples. In addition, optimal doping for fully oxygenated Nd123ss occurs for excess Nd (_x_ ~ 0.05). The solid lines represent the random mixture of Nd and Pr at the R and Ba site. The neutron data show that the Nd prefers the R site over Pr compared to random mixing. Based on ionic size arguments alone, this is expected since the Nd is slightly smaller.

#### iii.2.2 Oxygen content

Rietveld refinement of the chain and antichain site oxygen occupancies indicates that the charge compensation is deficient in most samples (Fig. 4), even though a prolonged low-temperature (450 degC) oxygenation was performed on ground powders. This suggests that the distribution of trivalent ions on divalent sites is not random. Since only \frac{1}{2} of an oxygen is needed to balance charge of the trivalent ion on the Ba site, the distribution or the R on the Ba sites determines how much excess oxygen a sample can uptake. It was observed that, in the Nd123ss, for doping levels of 0.1<_x_ < 0.4, the T_{c} could be varied considerably depending on how the samples were processed.[3] Higher _T__c_'s were observed for samples annealed at high temperatures in 1% PO2. It was postulated that the lower oxygen partial pressure enhances the pairing of trivalent ions across antichain sites. Pairing would reduce the number of excess holes due to partially compensated oxygen on antichain sites and reduce hole localization due to hole robing by uncompensated trivalent ions on the Ba sites. The lack of complete charge compensation in the bulk suggests poor pairing of the trivalent ions on the Ba sites. This, however, is consistent with results from the Nd123ss samples prepared in a similar manner.[3]

#### iii.2.3 Buckling of the Cu-O plane

Guillaume _et al.[15]_ showed that the presence or absence of superconductivity in R 123 compounds correlated strongly with the buckling of the Cu-O planes (critical angle of 167.3deg). In the comparison between fully oxygenated Pr123 and the other superconducting R 123 stoichiometric compounds, it was shown that the contraction in the c axis is due

  to an increase in the puckering of the Cu-O planes resulting in a decrease in the Pr-O2/O3 distances.[15] In oxygen-deficient samples (\delta\sim1), the puckering was similar for all R123 compounds, including Pr123. Figure 5 shows that the buckling of the Cu-O planes increases both with Nd and Pr going to the Ba site and that this puckering is similar to that seen in oxygen-deficient samples. There is a strong correlation between the degree of puckering and loss of T_{c}, so whatever is causing the Cu-O planes to distort from the ideal configuration also appears to be affecting superconductivity. In addition, this puckering occurs with either the removal of oxygen from the chain sites or filling of the antichain oxygen sites, reiterating the structural similarities between removal of oxygen in stoichiometric R123 and substitution of the trivalent R for Ba.

### _Magnetization measurements_

The structural similarities between the oxygen-deficient R123 and the excess R123s extend to their electronic structure.[7] Not only does T_{c} drop with increasing \delta in R123 and with increase in x in R_{1+s}Ba_{2-s}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta}, the details of the suppression are also similar. This includes the plateau with a T_{c} near 90 K for low doping levels and a second plateau with a T_{c} near 50 K for intermediate doping levels where the orthorhombic/tetragonal transition occurs. However, this analog breaks down for the Pr-doped samples studied here. Figure 6 shows that, for a range of R123s samples (R is Nd, Sm, and Eu), T_{c} is nearly identical over a wide range of doping levels, diverging only at higher doping levels for reasons not fully understood. The Pr-doped samples, however, show a more precipitous and linear drop in T_{c} with Pr content. In addition to the drop in T_{c} , there is also a decrease in the Meissner fraction with increasing Pr content (Fig. 7). The drop in the Meissner fraction would suggest that a second, nonsuperconducting phase is forming. However, this is not borne out by the structural and DTA analysis.

It is well known that Pr on the R site in RPr123 compounds does suppress superconductivity. The neutron-diffraction analysis shows that a substantial fraction of the Pr is going to the R site in the compounds under investigation. If it is assumed that the depression in superconductivity in these samples is due to two independent effects, (1) Pr on the R site for whatever reason and (2) R on the Ba site resulting in hole localization, it should be possible to separate out these two effects if they can be measured independently. Figure 6 shows that for z<0.2, the depression in T_{c} is independent of R except for Pr-doped samples. On the other hand, structurally Pr on the Ba site appears to behave as any other R. If it is assumed that the enhanced suppression in T_{c} is solely due to the Pr on the R site, and we have accu

Figure 8: T_{c} vs Pr occupation on the R site. The scatter in the T_{c} for the (Nd,Pr)Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta} samples (closed square symbol) is due to processing induced variations. The fitted line is only to that set of samples processed most like the (Nd,Pr)(Ba[Nd,Pr])_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta} samples. The error bars on the (Nd,Pr)(Ba[Nd,Pr])_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta} samples (closed diamonds) is the first \sigma of the fitted neutron data. The difference in T_{c} of the (Nd,Pr)(Ba[Nd,Pr])_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7+\delta} samples from the fitted line is assumed to be due to hole localization from R on the Ba site.

  rately measured Pr occupancy on the R site, we need to only determine the functional dependence of _T_c_ Pr (_R_ site) to determine if Pr on the Ba site has any effect on _T_c.

#### Effect of T_{c} for Pr on R site

Figure 8 shows the suppression of _T_c due to Pr on the R site in Nd1.05-yPr3Ba1.95Cu3O7. Again, a slight excess of Nd on the Ba site was used to obtain optimal doping level for superconductivity. For the optimally doped samples, Pr depresses superconductivity in a systematic, linear fashion. There is some variance in _T_c depending on how the samples are prepared.[16] The _T_c's for Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)1.95Cu3O7+_d_ is plotted against the measured site occupancy of Pr on the R site from Table I and compared to the _T_c's for Nd1.05-yBa1.95Cu3O7 and its known site occupancies. Any deviation in _T_c from the ideal case of Pr alone on the R site must then be due to hole localization by the trivalent ions on the Ba site. Correcting the _T_c's shown in Fig. 6 for the effect of Pr on the R site (Fig. 8) shows that the corrected _T_c's for the Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)1.95Cu3O7+_d_ samples follow the same curve as the other R 123ss. This indicates, that at least to the first order, the suppression in superconductivity in the Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)1.95Cu3O7+_d_ system is due to two independent effects, one due to Pr on the R site and the other hole localization due to the effect of the trivalent ion on the divalent site. Recent work on the Eu(Ba1-zPr)2Cu3O7+_d_ system, where there is a larger difference in ionic radii between Eu and Pr, indicates that Pr shows a strong affinity to substitute at the larger Ba site and a much reduced depression in _T_c compared to that in the Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)7+_d_ set of samples.[17]

## IV Conclusions

In this study, we have investigated the role of nominally substituting Pr onto the Ba sites in samples prepared with the nominal compositions of Nd1.05(Ba1-zPr)1.95Cu3O7+_d_. Neutron-diffraction data refined by the Rietveld method show that there is mixing of the R ions with a substantial fraction of the Pr going to the normal R site and some Nd going to the Ba site. Structural changes due to the trivalent R ions going to the Ba site are very similar to the Nd123ss, indicating that Pr behaves like other R on the Ba site. Magnetization measurements show that the depression in _T_c is more pronounced for the Pr bearing samples. However, on correcting the changes in _T_c for the fraction of Pr on the R site, this system also shows identical depression in _T_c as with other light R 123ss. Thus the depression in superconductivity in this set of samples is due to two independent effects: (1) Pr on the R site and (2) hole localization due to trivalent ions on the Ba site; Pr on the Ba site appears to behave like all the other trivalent R ions.
