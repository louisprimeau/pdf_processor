###### Abstract

Using transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared, positron annihilation, and differential specific-heat measurements, we have studied the properties and structure of the F-doped (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor. The results show that the fluorine atoms are homogeneously distributed in the superconducting phase and substituted for the oxygen atoms at O(2) crystallographic sites; the Pb-F and Cu-F bonds are formed. F-doping results in the variance of the incommensurate modulation structure, the increase of the point defects and chemical pressure, the enhancement of the flux-pinning effect, and the change of the electronic structure and chemical bond, and greatly improves the superconductive properties of the 2223 phase of (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O.

## 1 Introduction

A significant T_{e} enhancement in Bi-based 2223 phase superconductors by a partial substitution of fluorine for oxygen has been reported.1-3 Gao _et al._3 studied some characteristics of the F-doped Bi-based superconductors, and found that these superconductors have a slower flux-creep rate and obviously produce the flux-pinning effect. However, the crystallographic site of the doped fluorine and its influence on superconducting properties were not clearly known until now. In this paper, we present the results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared (IR), positron annihilation, and differential specific-heat measurements, and discuss the possible location of the doped fluorine and the physical behaviors caused by F doping.

## 2 Sample Preparation

To study the structure and properties of superconductor, a single crystal or single phase is important for measurement. Whereas, as pointed out in Refs. [4] and [5], the pure 2223 phase Bi system sample cannot be obtained easily. The principal difficulty is due to the coexistence of the 2223 phase with the 2212 phase in samples. Thus, undoped reference sample A and F-doped sample B were prepared for the compared measurements to exclude the influence of the 2212 phase.

For sample A, according to nominal composition Bi1.68Pb0.3SrSrCa2Cu3O10, high purity Bi2O3, PbO, SrCO3, CaCO3, and CuO were dissolved in 1:1 HNO3 then dried at 120 degC, preheated at 760 degC for 6 h, when nitrate was transformed into oxides, taken out and ground, calcined at 810 degC for 12 h, cooled, and ground again. The powder was pressed into pellets (~12 mm in diameter and ~1.2 mm thick). Then these pellets were sintered at 850 degC for 360 h and cooled naturally down to room temperature in the furnace. The zero resistance temperature _T__c_0 was 108.6 K for the samples. Q2223 = 86.5% was obtained; here, Q2223, which presents the amount factor of the 2223 phase, could approximately be evaluated from Fig. 1 and the formula

\[Q_{2223}\,\% = A_{2223}^{002}(\,A_{2223}^{002} + A_{2212}^{002})^{- 1}\%\ ,\]

where A_{2223}^{002} is the area of the 002 peak for the 2223 phase in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractogram and A_{2212}^{002} is that for the 2212 phase.

For sample B, except 0.4 mol CuF2 replacing 0.4 mol CuO, other components are the same as sample A. The powder was homogeneously mixed by grinding, heated at a rate of 450 degC/h to 680 degC and then 12 degC/h to 750 degC, and remained at 750 degC for 12 h. The products were ground, pressed into pellets, sintered at 790 degC for 10 h and then at 835 degC for 160-180 h, and finally quenched in air. The _R_-_T_ and _AC_-_T_ curves of the sample B are shown in Fig. 2. We can see from Fig. 2 that the zero resistance temperature _T__c_0 is 116.4 K, and the diamagnetic behavior occurs at 117.2 K. Q2223 = 93% was obtained from Fig. 1.

The XRD data show that the sample A and B were all tetragonal. Their lattice parameters were, respectively, a = 5.411 A and c = 37.246 A for sample A; a = 5.357 A and c = 36.951 A for sample B.

 

## III Measurement Results

### Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis

Presentation of incommensurate modulation structure is one of the features of Bi-based superconductors, the variation of which is an influence factor on T_{c}. Generally, doped elements make the modulation structure weaker and the period of the modulation longer. So by means of TEM analysis of the F-doped Bi-system superconductor, we can know whether F enters into the superconducting phase or not.

The H-800 TEM was used in the measurements. The diffraction patterns for samples A and B are shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3 we obtained the modulation periods at the b direction for the 2223 phase: 9.442 b for sample A, which is approximately consistent with the Ramesh's report (9.5 b),6 and 13.880 b for sample B, which show that F doping obviously extends the period of the modulation. Figure 3 also indicates that the feature of modulation for sample B is more clear than that for sample A. The results are the direct evidence for the fact that F has entered into the superconducting phase.

### X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)

Since the discovery of Bi-system superconductors, some investigations about the chemical band and electronic structure of Bi-system superconductors by XPS have been reported.6-8 Kihiki _et al._[8] discussed the distribution and properties of Bi, Sr, and Ca in the crystals based on the XPS experiments. According to the XPS results, Kishida _et al._[7] pointed out that the binding energy E_{b} of Cu 2p3/2 is stable whether in the Bi-Sr-Cu-O, (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Cu-O, (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O or Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor, but the E_{b} of Sr 3d5/2 and O 1s is vari

 able in the different systems. In this paper, we present results of XPS studies on the F-doped Bi-system superconductor and discuss the characteristic of the distribution and chemical bond of doped F.

XPS studies were carried out in a VG Silentific ESCA MK II system. The x-ray source was Mg_K_a_ and the vacuity was 1 x 10-8 mba. The charge effect was corrected by C1 = 284.4 eV. All measurements were performed at room temperature. The results displayed that the changes of only Pb 4f7/2 and Cu 2p3/2 were more than 0.3 eV. Their XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 4(I) and Fig. 4(II). The _E_b of F 1s in sample B is the same as that of PbF2 and CuF2, which is equal to 684.3 eV. The results also show that the _E_b for other elements in sample A is nearly identical with that in sample B.

Kishide _et al._7 reported that the _E_b of Cu 2P3/2 in Bi-Sr-Cu-O, (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Cu-O, (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O, or Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor, is all equal to 934.0 eV, which is close to our result for sample A 934.4 eV as shown in Fig. 4(I). The error possibly origins from the different apparatus in both laboratory and the samples made under different conditions. Whereas, the _E_b of Cu 2p3/2 for a F-doped sample B is equal to 935.1 eV, which is close to the _E_b for pure CuF2 935.4 eV. _E_b_-_E_d_4 = 0.70 eV implies that the oxidation state of copper in sample B may be higher than that in sample A.

The _E_b of Pb 4f7/2 in pure PbO is 138.0 eV, which is nearly equal to that 138.1 eV in Bi-based superconductors obtained by Gopinath and Subramanian.4 The _E_b of Pb 4f7/2 in sample A was also 138.1 eV as shown in Fig. 4(II). These indicate that the electronic state of lead is not a discrepancy in pure PbO and in the Bi-based superconductor. However, as shown in Fig. 4(II), the _E_b of Pb 4f7/2 in sample B was 139.0 eV, which is identical with that in pure PbF2. _E_b_-_E_d_4 = 0.9 eV clearly shows that the valence electron distribution of Pb is violently influenced by fluorine in the _F_-doped (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor.

It is generally believed that the site of Bi may be replaced by Pb in the Pb-doped Bi-system superconductor. Therefore, the above results manifest that the fluorine not only exists in the 2223 phase but also selectively interacts with copper and lead in the F-doped (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor.

### IR spectra

The 2212 and 2223 Bi-based superconductors have identical symmetry. They belong to the D148 space group. It is not difficult to appoint the normal vibration and the jurisdiction of irreducible representation in Bi-based superconductors.9-11 But in a doped system such as the replacement of Bi by 0.4 mol lead, only some unit cells can include one lead atom, and when there is a lead atom substituted for a bismuth atom in the unit cell, the symmetry would be decreased; thus because the dopant makes the chemical circumstance change, the number of IR peaks will increase, and some IR peaks will be shifted. Hence, IR spectrum for the doped system would be the superposition of the IR peaks from the unit cells with the different composition and symmetry. In this section, we focus the investigation on whether fluorine enters into the superconductive phase or not and which kind of place it occupies. We measured the standard materials such as CuF2, PbF2, CaF2, and SrF2, etc., the undoped and F-doped (Bi,Pb)-system superconductive sample under the same condition, and then analyzed and made a comparison among the results.

Since some normal vibration is very weak in the (Bi,Pb)-system superconductor and the samples are very black, the IR-photophonon spectrum technology was used to raise sensitivity. A Nicolet SPC equipment was employed to perform all measurements by scanning from 4000 to 240 cm-1. The peaks for the samples mainly ap

  peared in the range of 1000-240 cm^{-1}, as shown in Fig. 5. We find that in sample B, the Pb-F and Cu-F peaks appeared at 304.79 cm^{-1} and 354.95 cm^{-1}, respectively, and other metallic fluoride vibration peaks did not appear. The results show that the fluorine not only enters into the superconducting phase, but also is bonded to lead and copper.

### Specific heat

The differential specific heat can reflect bulk superconducting behaviors of the sample. In this section, the differential specific-heat measurements were used to study whether fluorine enters into the superconducting phase or not, and the effect of fluorine on superconductivity. A 342.0\pm0.2 mg of sample B and the same weight of sample A were taken and the measurements were carried out in the temperature range between 80-150 K.

The results are shown in Fig. 6. From Fig. 6, we can see that the _T_c of sample B is 7 K higher than that of sample A, which implies that fluorine enters into the superconducting phase. The big and sharp specific-heat anomalous peak of curve (b) in Fig. 6 shows that the fluorine distribution in sample B is homogeneous, otherwise the shoulder peaks or wide peak will appear in the curve. In addition, bigger curvature of curve (b) implies that F-doped samples have a higher Debye temperature.

### Positron annihilation study

Positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) is a useful method in the study of electronic structures and defects of condensed matter, which has been widely used to study Bi-based superconductors.[12]^{-}[14] In this section, we report some PAS results about the F-doped Bi-based superconductor.

Positron lifetime spectra were obtained by an ORTEC fast-fast coincidence system. The resolution [full width at half maximum (FWHM)] was determined to be 225 ps. A 20 \muCi 22Na sandwich source with a Mylar film substrate was used. Each lifetime spectrum was accumulated to 2\times106 counts. The lifetime spectra were analyzed by the program POSITRONFIT-EXTENDED,[15] and were freely fitted to three components, subtracting a source component (\tau = 310 ps, I = 15%), which is primarily due to positron annihilation in NaCl and Mylar film.

Figure 6: Specific-heat curve. (a) for sample A, (b) for sample B.

Figure 5: IR spectra. (a) for sample A, (b) for sample B.

  The mean lifetime \tau_{m} is obtained as

\[\tau_{m} = (\tau_{1}I_{1} + \tau_{2}I_{2})/(I_{1} + I_{2})\ .\]

Here I_{1} and I_{2} are the intensity of the lifetime \tau_{1} and \tau_{2}. The experiments showed that the longest lifetime \tau_{3} and its intensity I_{3} had nothing to do with the properties of samples; therefore, we do not discuss this component here.

The measurements showed that \tau_{m} of samples was independent of the temperature below 300 K, but was a function of the annealing temperature of the samples. Here, the annealing temperature varied from 800-200 degC, and at each temperature point, the samples were heated in air for 1 h and quenched onto a large cold copper plate. The results are shown in Fig. 7. The mean lifetime of sample B is shorter than that of sample A when the annealing temperature is lower than 200 degC, whereas, when the annealing temperature is higher than 300 degC, the mean lifetime becomes larger than that of sample A, as shown in Fig. 7. It means that fluorine is responsible for the variance of the means lifetime \tau_{m}.

The Doppler-broadening annihilation radiation (DBAR) spectra were obtained by a coaxial high pure Ge detector with a resolution (FWHM) of 1.5 keV at 514 keV line of 85Sr. A 5 \muCi 22Na sandwich source with an Ni foil substrate was used. Each spectrum was accumulated to 5\times 10^{6} counts.

The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of every DBAR spectrum after deconvolution is summarized in Table 1. The deconvolution spectra of sample B in normal and superconducting states are shown in Fig. 8. The difference spectra of samples A and B were obtained by subtracting the normal-state spectrum from the superconducting state spectrum, which is shown in Fig. 9.

As seen in Table 1 the FWHM of superconducting state is larger than that of normal state for each sample. The DBAR spectrum becomes sharper near P_{z} = 0 at 300 K as shown in Fig. 8. There is no sharp cutoff in the spectra to indicate a Fermi momentum. The sharpening of DBAR spectra with increasing temperature is contrary to what is commonly observed in positron annihilation. Normally, the thermal motion of the positron and electron increases with temperature and adds to the width of the DBAR spectra. From Fig. 9, we can see that the difference spectra is negative at the low momentum region, whereas it is positive at the high-momentum region. These results indicate that the number of electrons with high-momentum increases at liquid-nitrogen temperature. From Fig. 9, a very interesting result can be seen; namely, the amplitude of the negative peak near P_{z} = 0 for sample B is about twice that of sample A. Since the area of the positive or negative region in a spectrum is related to the amount of charge transfer, the above result implies that F doping can greatly change the amount of charge transfer.

## IV Discussion and Conclusion

### The crystallographic sites of fluorine

The x-ray diffraction results show that the content of other phases is about 7%, the 2223 superconducting

  phase is the main compound, and there is no metallic fluoride or other impurity in sample B. The TEM analysis and specific-heat measurement indicate that the fluorine has entered into the superconducting phase. XPS and IR spectra further indicate that fluorine is bonded to lead and copper. So, we can conclude that the fluorine really enters into the superconducting phase.

The further problem is which site is occupied by fluorine in the unit cell. For this reason, we first point out that the nominal composition of fluorine was equal to 0.8 mol introduced by CuF2, and because CuF2 is unstable at higher temperature, the reaction 2 CuF2+O2 -2CuO + 2F2 ! will happen and some fluorine will run away during calcining and sintering; the quantity of escaping fluorine increases with the increase of temperature and time. Elemental analysis results showed that sintering 200 h at 825 degC, the amount of fluorine in sample B was lower than or equal to 0.25 mol, which implies that there would be less than one fluorine atom in every unit cell on an average. Moreover, XPS and IR display that there exist chemical bonds of Pb-F and Cu-F in sample B, so we can predicate that the fluorine is bonded to Pb and Cu simultaneously, otherwise, it will contradict with our experimental results as TEM analysis, x-ray diffraction, and specific heat, etc. Generally, the site of Bi is occupied by Pb in Pb-doped Bi-based superconductors. So the O(2) crystallographic site may be replaced by the fluorine atom as shown in Fig. 10, which is similar to what the O(4) site is replaced by the fluorine atom in the F-doped Y-Ba-Cu-O and R-Ba-Cu-O.[16, 17]

In the Bi-based superconductors, copper bonded to four O(1) to form the copper-oxide plane, and to O(2) to construct a pyramid. Since F at the O(2) site bonded to Cu produces a strong Jahn-Teller effect, the fluorine would approach to lead, which may have a relation to the XPS experiments which showed that the binding energy shift of Pb 4p1/2 was bigger than that of Cu 2p3/2, and the IR spectra which indicate the wave-number order of Cu-F and Pb-F.

Bond energy D (_M_ - _L_) and force constant K_{L} between atom M and L can be evaluated by the following formulas:[18, 19]

\[\begin{array}{l} {D\left( {M - L} \right) = \left[ {D\left( {M - M} \right)D\left( {L - L} \right)} \right]^{1/2}} \\ {\quad\  the carrier. The positron DBAR spectra indicate that F doping can greatly change the amount of charge transfer, which may make the carrier concentration change to its optimum and hence increase the T_{c}.

We[20] calculated the electronic structure of the F-doped (Bi,Pb)-system superconductor by the DV-X\alpha method and found that when fluorine replaced O(2), the O 2p hole concentration in the Cu-O layer increased. The XPS results also show that the positive valence of copper in the F-doped sample increased, which induced the population to decrease in p orbitals of the oxygen atom, the hole concentration to increase, and thus the T_{c} to be improved.

In addition, the increase of the anomalous specific-heat sharp peak for the F-doped sample indicates that there was a high Debye frequency, so the phonon energy from lattice vibration increases, and the electrons exchange energy with a high-energy phonon, which leads to the increase of the energy gap when the Cooper electron pair was formed according to BCS theory. The results imply that there are more stable Cooper electron pairs in the F-doped sample than in the undoped sample, and the superconducting current density is bigger in the former than in the latter.

As described above, since lead and fluorine are simultaneously doped in Bi-based superconductor, the symmetry is decreased, and the degenerate energy level in the valency band as well as the Fermi level is split, so the state density will increase in the Fermi surface, which profits T_{c} increasing. In summary, we conclude that the increase of the T_{c} belongs to nature in the F-doped superconductor.

### The behavior in magnetic field

We investigated the magnetization irreversibility lines under a 0-2400 O_{e} magnetic field for the quenched F-doped (Bi,Pb)-system superconductor.[3] An interesting phenomenon was that the flux-creep rate S\!=\!dM/d\ln t for the F-doped sample became slower, the S\!\propto\!H^{2} for (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O, and the S\!\propto\!H^{1/2} for (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-(O,F). It was estimated that the flux-pinning potential was about 3000 K. These experimental facts probably come from two aspects; first, lightly doped fluorine atoms may be the pinning center, and secondly, since the positron mean lifetime of the F-doped sample is larger than that of the undoped sample when the quenching temperature is higher than 300 degC as shown in Fig. 7, which means that more point defects were produced in the F-doped sample, the additional pinning centers were formed. Therefore, the results of the increase of the pinning potential and the decrease of the flux-creep rate are inevitable. It is worth pointing out that the T_{c} of the F-doped sample quenched in the air increased 2.5\pm0.5 K higher than that of the same sample cooled in the furnace, which may be correlated to the pinning effect.

###### Abstract

Using transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared, positron annihilation, and differential specific-heat measurements, we have studied the properties and structure of the F-doped (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor. The results show that the fluorine atoms are homogeneously distributed in the superconducting phase and substituted for the oxygen atoms at O(2) crystallographic sites; the Pb-F and Cu-F bonds are formed. F-doping results in the variance of the incommensurate modulation structure, the increase of the point defects and chemical pressure, the enhancement of the flux-pinning effect, and the change of the electronic structure and chemical bond, and greatly improves the superconductive properties of the 2223 phase of (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O.

## 1 Introduction

A significant T_{e} enhancement in Bi-based 2223 phase superconductors by a partial substitution of fluorine for oxygen has been reported.1-3 Gao _et al._3 studied some characteristics of the F-doped Bi-based superconductors, and found that these superconductors have a slower flux-creep rate and obviously produce the flux-pinning effect. However, the crystallographic site of the doped fluorine and its influence on superconducting properties were not clearly known until now. In this paper, we present the results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared (IR), positron annihilation, and differential specific-heat measurements, and discuss the possible location of the doped fluorine and the physical behaviors caused by F doping.

## 2 Sample Preparation

To study the structure and properties of superconductor, a single crystal or single phase is important for measurement. Whereas, as pointed out in Refs. [4] and [5], the pure 2223 phase Bi system sample cannot be obtained easily. The principal difficulty is due to the coexistence of the 2223 phase with the 2212 phase in samples. Thus, undoped reference sample A and F-doped sample B were prepared for the compared measurements to exclude the influence of the 2212 phase.

For sample A, according to nominal composition Bi1.68Pb0.3SrSrCa2Cu3O10, high purity Bi2O3, PbO, SrCO3, CaCO3, and CuO were dissolved in 1:1 HNO3 then dried at 120 degC, preheated at 760 degC for 6 h, when nitrate was transformed into oxides, taken out and ground, calcined at 810 degC for 12 h, cooled, and ground again. The powder was pressed into pellets (~12 mm in diameter and ~1.2 mm thick). Then these pellets were sintered at 850 degC for 360 h and cooled naturally down to room temperature in the furnace. The zero resistance temperature _T__c_0 was 108.6 K for the samples. Q2223 = 86.5% was obtained; here, Q2223, which presents the amount factor of the 2223 phase, could approximately be evaluated from Fig. 1 and the formula

\[Q_{2223}\,\% = A_{2223}^{002}(\,A_{2223}^{002} + A_{2212}^{002})^{- 1}\%\ ,\]

where A_{2223}^{002} is the area of the 002 peak for the 2223 phase in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractogram and A_{2212}^{002} is that for the 2212 phase.

For sample B, except 0.4 mol CuF2 replacing 0.4 mol CuO, other components are the same as sample A. The powder was homogeneously mixed by grinding, heated at a rate of 450 degC/h to 680 degC and then 12 degC/h to 750 degC, and remained at 750 degC for 12 h. The products were ground, pressed into pellets, sintered at 790 degC for 10 h and then at 835 degC for 160-180 h, and finally quenched in air. The _R_-_T_ and _AC_-_T_ curves of the sample B are shown in Fig. 2. We can see from Fig. 2 that the zero resistance temperature _T__c_0 is 116.4 K, and the diamagnetic behavior occurs at 117.2 K. Q2223 = 93% was obtained from Fig. 1.

The XRD data show that the sample A and B were all tetragonal. Their lattice parameters were, respectively, a = 5.411 A and c = 37.246 A for sample A; a = 5.357 A and c = 36.951 A for sample B.

 

## III Measurement Results

### Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis

Presentation of incommensurate modulation structure is one of the features of Bi-based superconductors, the variation of which is an influence factor on T_{c}. Generally, doped elements make the modulation structure weaker and the period of the modulation longer. So by means of TEM analysis of the F-doped Bi-system superconductor, we can know whether F enters into the superconducting phase or not.

The H-800 TEM was used in the measurements. The diffraction patterns for samples A and B are shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3 we obtained the modulation periods at the b direction for the 2223 phase: 9.442 b for sample A, which is approximately consistent with the Ramesh's report (9.5 b),6 and 13.880 b for sample B, which show that F doping obviously extends the period of the modulation. Figure 3 also indicates that the feature of modulation for sample B is more clear than that for sample A. The results are the direct evidence for the fact that F has entered into the superconducting phase.

### X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)

Since the discovery of Bi-system superconductors, some investigations about the chemical band and electronic structure of Bi-system superconductors by XPS have been reported.6-8 Kihiki _et al._[8] discussed the distribution and properties of Bi, Sr, and Ca in the crystals based on the XPS experiments. According to the XPS results, Kishida _et al._[7] pointed out that the binding energy E_{b} of Cu 2p3/2 is stable whether in the Bi-Sr-Cu-O, (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Cu-O, (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O or Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor, but the E_{b} of Sr 3d5/2 and O 1s is vari

 able in the different systems. In this paper, we present results of XPS studies on the F-doped Bi-system superconductor and discuss the characteristic of the distribution and chemical bond of doped F.

XPS studies were carried out in a VG Silentific ESCA MK II system. The x-ray source was Mg_K_a_ and the vacuity was 1 x 10-8 mba. The charge effect was corrected by C1 = 284.4 eV. All measurements were performed at room temperature. The results displayed that the changes of only Pb 4f7/2 and Cu 2p3/2 were more than 0.3 eV. Their XPS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 4(I) and Fig. 4(II). The _E_b of F 1s in sample B is the same as that of PbF2 and CuF2, which is equal to 684.3 eV. The results also show that the _E_b for other elements in sample A is nearly identical with that in sample B.

Kishide _et al._7 reported that the _E_b of Cu 2P3/2 in Bi-Sr-Cu-O, (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Cu-O, (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O, or Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor, is all equal to 934.0 eV, which is close to our result for sample A 934.4 eV as shown in Fig. 4(I). The error possibly origins from the different apparatus in both laboratory and the samples made under different conditions. Whereas, the _E_b of Cu 2p3/2 for a F-doped sample B is equal to 935.1 eV, which is close to the _E_b for pure CuF2 935.4 eV. _E_b_-_E_d_4 = 0.70 eV implies that the oxidation state of copper in sample B may be higher than that in sample A.

The _E_b of Pb 4f7/2 in pure PbO is 138.0 eV, which is nearly equal to that 138.1 eV in Bi-based superconductors obtained by Gopinath and Subramanian.4 The _E_b of Pb 4f7/2 in sample A was also 138.1 eV as shown in Fig. 4(II). These indicate that the electronic state of lead is not a discrepancy in pure PbO and in the Bi-based superconductor. However, as shown in Fig. 4(II), the _E_b of Pb 4f7/2 in sample B was 139.0 eV, which is identical with that in pure PbF2. _E_b_-_E_d_4 = 0.9 eV clearly shows that the valence electron distribution of Pb is violently influenced by fluorine in the _F_-doped (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor.

It is generally believed that the site of Bi may be replaced by Pb in the Pb-doped Bi-system superconductor. Therefore, the above results manifest that the fluorine not only exists in the 2223 phase but also selectively interacts with copper and lead in the F-doped (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O superconductor.

### IR spectra

The 2212 and 2223 Bi-based superconductors have identical symmetry. They belong to the D148 space group. It is not difficult to appoint the normal vibration and the jurisdiction of irreducible representation in Bi-based superconductors.9-11 But in a doped system such as the replacement of Bi by 0.4 mol lead, only some unit cells can include one lead atom, and when there is a lead atom substituted for a bismuth atom in the unit cell, the symmetry would be decreased; thus because the dopant makes the chemical circumstance change, the number of IR peaks will increase, and some IR peaks will be shifted. Hence, IR spectrum for the doped system would be the superposition of the IR peaks from the unit cells with the different composition and symmetry. In this section, we focus the investigation on whether fluorine enters into the superconductive phase or not and which kind of place it occupies. We measured the standard materials such as CuF2, PbF2, CaF2, and SrF2, etc., the undoped and F-doped (Bi,Pb)-system superconductive sample under the same condition, and then analyzed and made a comparison among the results.

Since some normal vibration is very weak in the (Bi,Pb)-system superconductor and the samples are very black, the IR-photophonon spectrum technology was used to raise sensitivity. A Nicolet SPC equipment was employed to perform all measurements by scanning from 4000 to 240 cm-1. The peaks for the samples mainly ap

  peared in the range of 1000-240 cm^{-1}, as shown in Fig. 5. We find that in sample B, the Pb-F and Cu-F peaks appeared at 304.79 cm^{-1} and 354.95 cm^{-1}, respectively, and other metallic fluoride vibration peaks did not appear. The results show that the fluorine not only enters into the superconducting phase, but also is bonded to lead and copper.

### Specific heat

The differential specific heat can reflect bulk superconducting behaviors of the sample. In this section, the differential specific-heat measurements were used to study whether fluorine enters into the superconducting phase or not, and the effect of fluorine on superconductivity. A 342.0\pm0.2 mg of sample B and the same weight of sample A were taken and the measurements were carried out in the temperature range between 80-150 K.

The results are shown in Fig. 6. From Fig. 6, we can see that the _T_c of sample B is 7 K higher than that of sample A, which implies that fluorine enters into the superconducting phase. The big and sharp specific-heat anomalous peak of curve (b) in Fig. 6 shows that the fluorine distribution in sample B is homogeneous, otherwise the shoulder peaks or wide peak will appear in the curve. In addition, bigger curvature of curve (b) implies that F-doped samples have a higher Debye temperature.

### Positron annihilation study

Positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) is a useful method in the study of electronic structures and defects of condensed matter, which has been widely used to study Bi-based superconductors.[12]^{-}[14] In this section, we report some PAS results about the F-doped Bi-based superconductor.

Positron lifetime spectra were obtained by an ORTEC fast-fast coincidence system. The resolution [full width at half maximum (FWHM)] was determined to be 225 ps. A 20 \muCi 22Na sandwich source with a Mylar film substrate was used. Each lifetime spectrum was accumulated to 2\times106 counts. The lifetime spectra were analyzed by the program POSITRONFIT-EXTENDED,[15] and were freely fitted to three components, subtracting a source component (\tau = 310 ps, I = 15%), which is primarily due to positron annihilation in NaCl and Mylar film.

Figure 6: Specific-heat curve. (a) for sample A, (b) for sample B.

Figure 5: IR spectra. (a) for sample A, (b) for sample B.

  The mean lifetime \tau_{m} is obtained as

\[\tau_{m} = (\tau_{1}I_{1} + \tau_{2}I_{2})/(I_{1} + I_{2})\ .\]

Here I_{1} and I_{2} are the intensity of the lifetime \tau_{1} and \tau_{2}. The experiments showed that the longest lifetime \tau_{3} and its intensity I_{3} had nothing to do with the properties of samples; therefore, we do not discuss this component here.

The measurements showed that \tau_{m} of samples was independent of the temperature below 300 K, but was a function of the annealing temperature of the samples. Here, the annealing temperature varied from 800-200 degC, and at each temperature point, the samples were heated in air for 1 h and quenched onto a large cold copper plate. The results are shown in Fig. 7. The mean lifetime of sample B is shorter than that of sample A when the annealing temperature is lower than 200 degC, whereas, when the annealing temperature is higher than 300 degC, the mean lifetime becomes larger than that of sample A, as shown in Fig. 7. It means that fluorine is responsible for the variance of the means lifetime \tau_{m}.

The Doppler-broadening annihilation radiation (DBAR) spectra were obtained by a coaxial high pure Ge detector with a resolution (FWHM) of 1.5 keV at 514 keV line of 85Sr. A 5 \muCi 22Na sandwich source with an Ni foil substrate was used. Each spectrum was accumulated to 5\times 10^{6} counts.

The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of every DBAR spectrum after deconvolution is summarized in Table 1. The deconvolution spectra of sample B in normal and superconducting states are shown in Fig. 8. The difference spectra of samples A and B were obtained by subtracting the normal-state spectrum from the superconducting state spectrum, which is shown in Fig. 9.

As seen in Table 1 the FWHM of superconducting state is larger than that of normal state for each sample. The DBAR spectrum becomes sharper near P_{z} = 0 at 300 K as shown in Fig. 8. There is no sharp cutoff in the spectra to indicate a Fermi momentum. The sharpening of DBAR spectra with increasing temperature is contrary to what is commonly observed in positron annihilation. Normally, the thermal motion of the positron and electron increases with temperature and adds to the width of the DBAR spectra. From Fig. 9, we can see that the difference spectra is negative at the low momentum region, whereas it is positive at the high-momentum region. These results indicate that the number of electrons with high-momentum increases at liquid-nitrogen temperature. From Fig. 9, a very interesting result can be seen; namely, the amplitude of the negative peak near P_{z} = 0 for sample B is about twice that of sample A. Since the area of the positive or negative region in a spectrum is related to the amount of charge transfer, the above result implies that F doping can greatly change the amount of charge transfer.

## IV Discussion and Conclusion

### The crystallographic sites of fluorine

The x-ray diffraction results show that the content of other phases is about 7%, the 2223 superconducting

  phase is the main compound, and there is no metallic fluoride or other impurity in sample B. The TEM analysis and specific-heat measurement indicate that the fluorine has entered into the superconducting phase. XPS and IR spectra further indicate that fluorine is bonded to lead and copper. So, we can conclude that the fluorine really enters into the superconducting phase.

The further problem is which site is occupied by fluorine in the unit cell. For this reason, we first point out that the nominal composition of fluorine was equal to 0.8 mol introduced by CuF2, and because CuF2 is unstable at higher temperature, the reaction 2 CuF2+O2 -2CuO + 2F2 ! will happen and some fluorine will run away during calcining and sintering; the quantity of escaping fluorine increases with the increase of temperature and time. Elemental analysis results showed that sintering 200 h at 825 degC, the amount of fluorine in sample B was lower than or equal to 0.25 mol, which implies that there would be less than one fluorine atom in every unit cell on an average. Moreover, XPS and IR display that there exist chemical bonds of Pb-F and Cu-F in sample B, so we can predicate that the fluorine is bonded to Pb and Cu simultaneously, otherwise, it will contradict with our experimental results as TEM analysis, x-ray diffraction, and specific heat, etc. Generally, the site of Bi is occupied by Pb in Pb-doped Bi-based superconductors. So the O(2) crystallographic site may be replaced by the fluorine atom as shown in Fig. 10, which is similar to what the O(4) site is replaced by the fluorine atom in the F-doped Y-Ba-Cu-O and R-Ba-Cu-O.[16, 17]

In the Bi-based superconductors, copper bonded to four O(1) to form the copper-oxide plane, and to O(2) to construct a pyramid. Since F at the O(2) site bonded to Cu produces a strong Jahn-Teller effect, the fluorine would approach to lead, which may have a relation to the XPS experiments which showed that the binding energy shift of Pb 4p1/2 was bigger than that of Cu 2p3/2, and the IR spectra which indicate the wave-number order of Cu-F and Pb-F.

Bond energy D (_M_ - _L_) and force constant K_{L} between atom M and L can be evaluated by the following formulas:[18, 19]

\[\begin{array}{l} {D\left( {M - L} \right) = \left[ {D\left( {M - M} \right)D\left( {L - L} \right)} \right]^{1/2}} \\ {\quad\  the carrier. The positron DBAR spectra indicate that F doping can greatly change the amount of charge transfer, which may make the carrier concentration change to its optimum and hence increase the T_{c}.

We[20] calculated the electronic structure of the F-doped (Bi,Pb)-system superconductor by the DV-X\alpha method and found that when fluorine replaced O(2), the O 2p hole concentration in the Cu-O layer increased. The XPS results also show that the positive valence of copper in the F-doped sample increased, which induced the population to decrease in p orbitals of the oxygen atom, the hole concentration to increase, and thus the T_{c} to be improved.

In addition, the increase of the anomalous specific-heat sharp peak for the F-doped sample indicates that there was a high Debye frequency, so the phonon energy from lattice vibration increases, and the electrons exchange energy with a high-energy phonon, which leads to the increase of the energy gap when the Cooper electron pair was formed according to BCS theory. The results imply that there are more stable Cooper electron pairs in the F-doped sample than in the undoped sample, and the superconducting current density is bigger in the former than in the latter.

As described above, since lead and fluorine are simultaneously doped in Bi-based superconductor, the symmetry is decreased, and the degenerate energy level in the valency band as well as the Fermi level is split, so the state density will increase in the Fermi surface, which profits T_{c} increasing. In summary, we conclude that the increase of the T_{c} belongs to nature in the F-doped superconductor.

### The behavior in magnetic field

We investigated the magnetization irreversibility lines under a 0-2400 O_{e} magnetic field for the quenched F-doped (Bi,Pb)-system superconductor.[3] An interesting phenomenon was that the flux-creep rate S\!=\!dM/d\ln t for the F-doped sample became slower, the S\!\propto\!H^{2} for (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-O, and the S\!\propto\!H^{1/2} for (Bi,Pb)-Sr-Ca-Cu-(O,F). It was estimated that the flux-pinning potential was about 3000 K. These experimental facts probably come from two aspects; first, lightly doped fluorine atoms may be the pinning center, and secondly, since the positron mean lifetime of the F-doped sample is larger than that of the undoped sample when the quenching temperature is higher than 300 degC as shown in Fig. 7, which means that more point defects were produced in the F-doped sample, the additional pinning centers were formed. Therefore, the results of the increase of the pinning potential and the decrease of the flux-creep rate are inevitable. It is worth pointing out that the T_{c} of the F-doped sample quenched in the air increased 2.5\pm0.5 K higher than that of the same sample cooled in the furnace, which may be correlated to the pinning effect.
