###### Abstract

We successfully grew the high-quality single crystal of
Rb_(0.83)Fe_(1.81)Se₂, which shows a clear superconducting transition in
magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity. Resistivity shows
the onset superconducting transition $T_{\rm c}$ at 32.1 K and zero
resistivity at 30 K. From the low-temperature iso-magnetic-field
magnetoresistance, the large upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}(0)$ has
been estimated to be as high as 180 T for the field applied within the
ab plane and 59 T for the field applied along the c axis. The anisotropy
$H_{\rm c2}^{\rm d}(0)/H_{\rm c2}^{\rm d}(0)$ is around 3.0, lying right
between those observed in K_(x)Fe₂Se₂ and Cs_(x)Fe₂Se₂.

REVIEW B **83**, 060512(R) (2011)

The newly discovered iron-based superconductors have attracted worldwide
attention in the past three years [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] because of their high
superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$ as high as 55 K) and
the fact that superconductivity emerges in proximity to the magnetically
ordered state [6, 7]. The fact that superconductivity in the
iron-pnictide compounds is closely related to the magnetic correlations
inspires researchers tending to connect them with the high-$T_{\rm c}$
cuprates, in which superconductivity is realized by suppressing the
antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state. It is helpful to understand the
superconducting mechanism in the same theoretical scenario for both
families. Up to now, a variety of Fe-based superconductors, such as the
ZrCuSiAs-type LnFeAsO (Ln-1111, Ln is a rare-earth element) [1, 2, 3],
the ThCr₂Si₂-type AeFe₂As₂ (_Ae_-122, Ae is an alkaline-earth element)
[4], the Fe₂As-type AFeAs (A-111, A is Li or Na) [8, 9, 10], and the
anti-PbO-type Fe(Se,Te) [11], [11] have been discovered.
Antiferromagnetic spin density wave instability usually exists in the
parent compound of the superconducting Ln-1111 and Ae-122, and even
coexists with superconductivity in the slightly doping levels of
Ln-1111, Ae-122, and A-111. While for the 11 phase, magnetism is quite
complicated and its relationship to superconductivity remains more
unrecognized.

All of the above-mentioned Fe-based superconductors have a common
structural feature with the edge-sharing FeAs₄ (FeSe₄) tetrahedra formed
FeAs (FeSe) layers. The superconductivity in these compounds is thought
to be intimately associated with the height of the anion from the Fe
layer [12]. The FeAs-based compounds usually possess cations or building
blocks between the FeAs layers, while the Fe(Se,Te) family has an
extremely simple structure with only the FeSe layers stacking along the
c axis without other cations between them [11]. High pressure has been
used to change the height of the anion from the Fe layer in Fe(Se,Te).
Especially, $T_{\rm c}$ can reach 37 K (onset) under 4.5 GPa from 8 K in
FeSe (Ref. [13]) with a pressure-dependent ratio of $T_{\rm c}$ as large
as $dT_{\rm c}/dP\sim$ 9.1 K/GPa, which is the highest pressure effect
among all the Fe-based superconductors [13]. Researchers attempted to
intercalate Tl between the FeSe layers to change the local structure of
the FeSe family. However, an antiferromagnetic ordering formed at
temperatures as high as 450 K [14], and no superconductivity was
observed in TlFe₂Se₂. Very recently, the alkali atoms K and Cs were
successfully intercalated between the FeSe layers, and superconductivity
was enhanced from $T_{\rm c}$ = 8 K of the pure FeSe to 30 K and 27 K
(onset) without any external pressure [15, 16, 17, 18]. This indicates
that $T_{\rm c}$ in the FeSe family can really be enhanced by
intercalating cations between the FeSe layers.

In this article, we successfully grew the single crystals of a new
superconductor Rb_(x)Fe₂Se₂ by using the Bridgeman method. The crystals
showed an onset $T_{\rm c}$ of 32.1 K and zero resistivity at about 30
K. Nearly 100

Single crystals of Rb_(x)Fe₂Se₂ were grown by the Bridgeman method. The
starting material FeSe was obtained by reacting the Fe powder with Se
powder with Fe:Se = 1:1 at 700 ^(∘)C for 4 h. Rb pieces and FeSe powder
were put into a small quartz tube with the nominal composition of
Rb_(0.83)Fe₂Se₂. Due to the high activity of the Rb metal, the
single-wall quartz tube would have been corrupted and broken during the
growth procedure. Therefore, the double-wall quartz tube was used here.
A small quartz tube was sealed under a high vacuum and then placed into
a bigger quartz tube. Subsequently, the bigger quartz tube was evacuated
and sealed. The mixture was heated to 980 ^(∘)C in 10 h and kept for 4
h, and then melted at 1080 ^(∘)C for 2 h, and later slowly cooled down
to 780 ^(∘)C at a rate of 6 ^(∘)C/h. After that, the temperature was
cooled down to room temperature by shutting down the furnace. The
obtained rod on the bottom of the inner tube was then removed from the
silica tubes in the glove box. All the products are single crystals and
no obvious other phase can be observed. The obtained single crystals
show a flat shiny surface with a dark black color. The crystals are easy
to cleave, and thin crystals with thickness less than 100 μm can be
easily obtained.

The single crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD),
energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), magnetic susceptibility, and
electrical transport measurements. Powder XRD and single-crystal XRD
were performed on the theta/theta rotating anode x-ray (TTRAX3)
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and a fixed graphite monochromator.
Magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out using the Quantum
Design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID). The measurement of resistivity and
magnetoresistance were done on the Quantum Design physical property
measurement system (PPMS-9).

Figure 1 shows the single-crystal XRD [Fig. 1(a)] and powder XRD [Fig.
1(b)] after grinding the single crystals into powder. Only (00l)
reflections were recognized in Fig. 1(a), indicating that the crystals
of Rb_(x)Fe₂Se₂ were perfectly grown along the c axis. From the powder
XRD patterns in Fig. 1(b), the lattice constants were calculated based
on the symmetry I4/mmm with the lattice parameters a = 3.925 A; and c =
14.5655 A. The lattice constants of a and c lie between those of
K_(x)Fe₂Se₂ and Cs_(x)Fe₂Se₂, respectively. It is consistent with the
expectation based on the variation of the radii of the K, Rb, and Cs
ions (K 1.51 A, Rb 1.63 A, Cs 1.78 A).[19] The elemental analysis of the
crystals were performed by the EDX and ICP-AES. The EDX results for five
points show the standard deviations of 0.034 for Rb and 0.027 for Se,
indicating the composition of the crystal is homogeneous. As we know,
however, EDX is quite qualitative and has large errors sometimes.
Therefore, we use a more accurate method, ICP-AES, to determine the
actual composition of the crystal. The ICP-AES gives Rb:Fe:Se to be
0.88:1.81:2, which is consistent with the cases of K_(x)Fe₂Se₂ and
Cs_(x)Fe₂Se₂.[15; 17] We will use this proportion of Rb, Fe, and Se in
the formula of the compound in the following text.

Figure 2 shows magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature
below 35 K for the single-crystalline Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂ under a
magnetic field of 10 Oe. The zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field cooling
(FC) susceptibilities show that the superconducting shield begins to
emerge at about 30.6 K and then show a clear transition. The ZFC
magnetic susceptibility becomes saturating below 10 K, indicating the
high quality of the single crystal. The superconducting volume fraction
estimated from the ZFC magnetization at 4 K is 100

Figure 3 shows the magnetic susceptibility of Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂ with
the magnetic field of 5 T applied parallel and perpendicular to the c
axis from 10 to 400 K. At low temperature, the superconducting trace can
still be found because of a drop in susceptibility. When the magnetic
field is applied along the c axis, the magnetic susceptibility gradually
decreases with decreasing the temperature. The susceptibility shows a
minimum at about 120 K with the magnetic field

applied within the _ab_ plane. Above 120 K, the susceptibility
monotonically increases with increasing temperature; while it gradually
increases with decreasing temperature down to about 40 K just above the
superconducting transition temperature. Although the in-plane χ(T) shows
a minimum 120 K above $T_{\rm c}$, the magnitude of the susceptibility
only changes by less than 2.5

Figure 4 shows the in-plane resistivity as the function of the
temperature for the single-crystalline Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂. The
Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂ shows a semiconductor-like behavior at high
temperature, and displays a maximum resistivity at about 150 K followed
by a metallic behavior below 150 K and then a superconducting transition
at about 32 K. A similar resistivity has been observed in
K_(x)Fe₂Se₂.[15, 18] It seems that the resistivity behavior observed
here is a common feature. The temperature corresponding to the maximum
resistivity in Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂ is higher than that for K_(x)Fe₂Se₂
reported by Guo _et al._ (around 100 K)[15] and by Ying _et al._ (around
120 K),[18] while it is less than that reported by Mizuguchi _et al._
(∼200 K).[16] The maximum resistivity in the Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂
crystal here (∼37 Ω cm) is much larger than that of K_(x)Fe₂Se₂ in the
previous report (∼3 Ω cm).[16] The temperature of the maximum
resistivity strongly depends on the sample. The different temperature of
the maximum resistivity could arise from the vacancies within the FeSe
layers. The residual resistance ratio between 150 and 33 K is as large
as 9. With further decreasing of the temperature, superconductivity
emerges at about 32.1 K and resistivity reaches zero at about 30 K.
These values are very close to those observed in K_(x)Fe₂Se₂.[15, 16]
The resistivity of the Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂ crystal is 6 Ω cm at room
temperature, which is much larger than those of the FeSe single
crystals[20] and the other iron-pnictide superconductors.[21] This may
arise from the large disorder induced by deficiencies with the
conducting FeSe layers. The occurrence of superconductivity in a system
with so high a resistivity demands further theoretical and experimental
investigations.

and $T_{\rm c}$ = 32.1 K. Then the $H_{\rm c2}(0)$ can be estimated to
be 180 and 59 T with the magnetic field applied within the ab plane and
along the c axis, respectively. These values are less than those in
K_(x)Fe₂Se₂[16, 18], while larger than those in CsFe₂Se₂[18]. The
anisotropy $H_{\rm c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{\rm c2}^{c}(0)$ is about 3.0, and this
value just lies right between those of K_(x)Fe₂Se₂ and Cs_(x)Fe₂Se₂.
This anisotropy value is similar to 2.5-3.5 in the Sn-flux grown
Ba_(0.55K)O_(4.95)Fe₂As₂ crystal [32, 34], but larger than 1.70∼1.86 in
the FeAs-flux grown Ba_(0.60K)O_(4.06)Fe₂As₂ crystal [25] and less than
4∼6 in the F-doped NdFeAsO crystal [26].

We have systematically grown the single crystals $A_{\rm x}$Fe₂Se₂ (A =
K, Rb, and Cs). A maximum resistivity as shown in Fig. 4 is widely
observed in K_(x)Fe₂As₂ (Refs. [15, 16, 18]) and Rb_(x)Fe₂As₂. The very
large magnitude of resistivity has been observed for all the
$A_{\rm x}$Fe₂Se₂ single crystals, with the superconductivity still
existing. This implies that there is a large amount of deficiencies,
with the conducting FeSe layers inducing a very high resistivity.
However, superconductivity could be less influenced by such deficiencies
because of the coexistence of high resistivity and superconductivity.
Further study on the origin of the deficiencies should be conducted to
understand the normal-state behavior, even the superconductivity of
$A_{\rm x}$Fe₂Se₂ materials.

In conclusion, we successfully grew superconductor Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂
single crystals. $T_{\rm c}^{\rm onset}$ is 32.1 K determined by
resistivity measurement, and zero resistivity is reached at 30 K. The
ZFC dc magnetic susceptibility indicates that the crystal is fully
diamagnetic. A large $H_{\rm c2}(0)$ is observed, which is similar to
those in the iron-pnictide superconductors [24, 27]. The anisotropy
$H_{\rm c2}^{ab}(0)/H_{\rm c2}^{c}(0)$ is 3.0, lying right between those
of K_(x)Fe₂Se₂ and Cs_(x)Fe₂Se₂. A common peculiar susceptibility in the
normal state is observed in Rb_(0.88)Fe_(1.81)Se₂.
