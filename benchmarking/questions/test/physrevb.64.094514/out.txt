###### Abstract

We have measured the magnetic penetration depth of the recently discovered binary superconductor MgB_{2} using muon spin rotation and low-field ac susceptibility. From the damping of the muon precession signal we find the penetration depth at zero temperature is \sim85 nm. The low-temperature penetration depth shows a quadratic temperature dependence, indicating either the presence of nodes in the gap or that the gap minimum must be smaller than the lowest temperature measured (4.2 K) if the pairing has anisotropic s-wave symmetry.

The discovery of superconductivity in the simple binary compound MgB_{2} with a remarkably high transition temperature T_{c}\sim39 K has attracted great interest.[1] MgB_{2} is a hexagonal AlB_{2}-type compound, consisting of alternating hexagonal Mg layers and graphitelike B layers. To explore the mechanism of superconductivity in this material it is important to determine the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, which governs the behavior of quasiparticle excitations below T_{c}. Experimentally this can be done by measuring thermodynamic responses of superconducting quasiparticles at low temperatures. In conventional s-wave superconductors, there are no quasiparticle excitations at low energies and the thermodynamic and transport coefficients decay exponentially at low temperatures. However, in unconventional superconductors with gap nodes, such as in high-T_{c} oxides, power law behaviors are expected in thermodynamic coefficients at low temperatures.

Recently, the scanning tunneling conductance,[2, 3, 4, 5] the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate[6] of MgB_{2}, and the specific heat[7] have been measured. Although it was claimed that the experimental data are consistent with a conventional s-wave pairing gap, the data reported are rather controversial and no consensus can really be reached regarding the pairing symmetry. The gap values obtained from the scanning tunneling measurements vary from 2 meV to 7 meV. The low-temperature dependences of tunneling spectra reported by different experimental groups also behave differently. The difference in both the value of the energy gap and the low-temperature dependence of the tunneling spectrum is probably due to the state of the surface, as well as the inhomogeneity of the samples measured. The spin-lattice relaxation rate measured by Kotegawa _et al.[6]_ shows a very small coherence peak just below T_{c}, followed by an exponential decay in a broad temperature range. However, their measurement was done at relatively high temperatures (above 15 K), and it is not known whether this exponential behavior extends to lower temperatures.

In this paper, we report our experimental data of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda of MgB_{2} in the superconducting state. We have measured \lambda using the transverse-field muon spin rotation (TF-\muSR) and low field ac susceptibility. From both measurements, we find that at low temperatures \lambda varies quadratically with temperature and does not show the activated exponential behavior expected for a conventional s-wave superconductor. The quadratic behavior of \lambda is evidence for unconventional superconductivity.

The penetration depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the superfluid density. Its temperature dependence is a measure of the low-lying superconducting quasiparticle excitations and no phonon contribution is directly involved. This makes the analysis of penetration depth data simple. Another advantage of the penetration depth measurement is that it allows us to determine whether there are nodes in the superconducting energy gap even with slightly impure samples.[8, 9]

The sample measured was commercially available MgB_{2} powder (Alfa Aesar). The superconducting transition temperature, as determined by both ac susceptibility and dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) (at 20 G) measurements, is 37.5 K. High-field dc SQUID and electron microscopy investigations showed less than 1% of impurities present. The ac susceptibility measurements were performed at an applied field H_{ac}= 1 G rms and frequency f= 333 Hz on fine powder. The absence of weak links was confirmed by checking the linearity of the pickup voltage at 4.2 K for H_{ac} from 1 to 10 G rms and f from 16 to 667 Hz.

TF-\muSR is a sensitive technique for measuring \lambda. In this technique, the field distribution of a flux-line lattice of a type-II superconductor produced by an applied magnetic field is probed by fully polarized positive muons implanted into a specimen. The muon decays with a lifetime 2.2 \mus, emitting a positron preferentially in the direction of the muon spin at the time of decay. By accumulating time histograms of the decay positrons the muon polarization can be followed as a function of time. In type-II superconductors, the muon spin precesses about the local field, which is modulated by flux vortices. The time resolved polarization signal is oscillatory with a decreasing amplitude. The damping of the muon precession signal provides a measure of the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field \Delta B in the vortex state, hence the magnetic penetration depth \lambda.[10, 11, 12] For polycrystalline samples the envelope of the muon precession signal has ap proximately a Gaussian form \exp(-\,\sigma^{2}t^{2}/2) and the depolarization rate \sigma can be shown to be proportional to the superfluid density 1/\lambda^{2},[11, 12] For isotropic type-II superconductors, \lambda is given by [10]

\[\sigma(\mu s^{-1})\!=\!7.904\!\times\!10^{4}\!\times\!\lambda^{-2}\;\;\;({\rm nm }),\] (1)

whereas for anisotropic superconductors such as the high-T_{c} cuprates, the in-plane penetration depth can be determined from \sigma (Ref. [11]),

\[\sigma(\mu s^{-1})\!=\!7.086\!\times\!10^{4}\!\times\!\lambda^{-2}\;\;\;({\rm nm }).\] (2)

Evidence about the anisotropy of the superconductivity may be obtained from the form of the distribution of internal fields P(B), which can be derived by Fourier transforming the muon precession signal. Detailed information requires data from single crystals. However in powder samples of anisotropic superconductors it is found that the distribution P(B) has a characteristic shoulder on the low-field side of the central frequency.[13] We used the maximum entropy method to extract P(B) from the TF-\muSR data for MgB_{2}. For temperatures just below T_{c} the low-field shoulder is clearly evident, so we conclude that MgB_{2} is anisotropic.

Our TF-cooled \muSR measurements were performed at the ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The sample measured by TF-\muSR was a pellet of MgB_{2}, 4 cm in diameter and 2 mm thick, prepared by cold pressing the powder. The pellet was mounted in a transverse magnetic field H_{app}, which was above the lower critical field but below the upper critical field, H_{c1}\!\!<\!\!H_{app}\!\!<\!\!H_{c2}. H_{c1} and H_{c2} of MgB_{2} are about 300 G and 18 T, respectively.[14] We used a field of 450 G. (Measurements at not too high fields compared to H_{c2} can minimize possible effects of dissipation due to flux motion and allow us to obtain reliable data for the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate \sigma.[15]) A set of measurements at different fields (up to 600 G) was also done to ensure that the values of \sigma obtained were independent of the applied field.

The low-field ac susceptibility is also a commonly used technique for measuring \lambda. It has been successfully applied to high-T_{c} materials[16] and is particularly suitable for powder samples. The accuracy in the temperature dependence of \lambda determined from the ac susceptibility technique is significantly higher than that of TF-\muSR.[15] In the superconducting state, the effective ac susceptibility \chi of a powder sample is related to \lambda by the equation[17, 18]

\[\chi(T)\!=\!\chi_{0}\!\left\langle 1-\frac{3\lambda}{R}{\rm coth}\frac{R}{ \lambda}+\frac{3\lambda^{2}}{R^{2}}\right\rangle,\] (3)

where \chi_{0} is the susceptibility in an ideal diamagnetic system, R is the radius of a grain, and \langle\cdots\rangle denotes a grain average defined by \langle x\rangle\!=\!fdRxR^{3}g(R)/\!fdRR^{3}g(R) with g(R) the grain-size distribution function. At low temperatures, \chi(T) can be expanded with \delta\lambda(T)\!=\!\lambda(T)\!-\!\lambda_{0}, where \lambda_{0}=\!\lambda(0\;\;{\rm K}). To the leading order in \delta\lambda, we find

\[\chi(T)\!\approx\!\chi(0)+\alpha\,\delta\lambda(T),\] (4)

where

\[\chi(0)\!=\!\chi_{0}\!\left\langle 1-\frac{3\lambda_{0}}{R}{\rm coth} \frac{R}{\lambda_{0}}+\frac{3\,\lambda_{0}^{2}}{R^{2}}\right\rangle,\] (5)

\[\alpha\!=\!\chi_{0}\!\left\langle\frac{6\lambda_{0}}{R}-3\;{\rm coth}\frac{R} {\lambda_{0}}\!-\!\frac{3R}{\lambda_{0}{\rm sinh}^{2}[R/\lambda_{0}]}\right\rangle \!<\!0.\] (6)

At low temperatures, the change in \lambda is proportional to the change in \chi. Thus from the temperature dependence of \chi(T) (exponential or power law), one can readily determine the temperature dependence of \lambda(T) in the low-temperature regime. However, to determine the absolute value of \lambda, we need to know accurately the grain distribution function g(R), which is beyond the scope of the present work.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the muon depolarization rate \sigma. At zero temperature we find that \sigma(0\;\;{\rm K})\!\sim\!10\;\;\mu s^{-1}. The corresponding in-plane penetration depth at 0 K is \lambda_{0}\!\sim\!85\;\;{\rm nm}. The temperature dependence of \lambda at low temperature is clearly stronger than the exponentially activated temperature dependence expected for an s-wave superconductor. In fact, we find that \sigma varies approximately quadratically with T in the whole temperature range below T_{c} (Fig. 2). This is supported by our low

  temperature ac susceptibility data shown in Fig. 3, which is related to the penetration depth by Eq. (4). The T^{2} behavior of \lambda at low temperatures suggests that either there are nodes in the superconducting energy gap [9] or the minimum gap is significantly less than 4.2 K if the pairing has anisotropic s-wave symmetry.

The \lambda values shown in Fig. 1 have been estimated using Eq. (2). If the electromagnetic response of MgB_{2} is more isotropic, the values of \lambda reported here need to be multiplied by a constant factor c of order 1. In the extremely isotropic case c=1.06. However, the T^{2} dependence of \lambda is unchanged.

The T^{2} behavior of \lambda at low temperatures is a typical feature of disordered superconductors with line nodes, such as the Zn-doped high-T_{c} superconductor YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}. [8, 19] In fact as little as 0.31% Zn substitution can cause a crossover from a linear temperature dependence to T^{2} without affecting T_{c}. [8] This has been interpreted as the effect of impurity scattering on a superconductor with line nodes in the energy gap and offers a natural explanation for the T^{2} behavior of \lambda we found in MgB_{2}. The T^{2} dependence of \lambda in disordered high-T_{c} oxides is robust against Zn doping. [19]

In conclusion, we have measured the magnetic penetration depth of the newly discovered superconductor MgB_{2} using the transverse-field \muSR and low-field ac susceptibility techniques. The value of \lambda at 0 K is about 85 nm. \lambda shows a T^{2} dependence at low temperatures. This is strong evidence for unconventional superconducting pairing in MgB_{2}.

whereas for anisotropic superconductors such as the high-T_{c} cuprates, the in-plane penetration depth can be determined from \sigma (Ref. [11]),

\[\sigma(\mu s^{-1})\!=\!7.086\!\times\!10^{4}\!\times\!\lambda^{-2}\;\;\;({\rm nm }).\] (2)

The pellet was mounted in a transverse magnetic field H_{app}, which was above the lower critical field but below the upper critical field, H_{c1}\!\!<\!\!H_{app}\!\!<\!\!H_{c2}. H_{c1} and H_{c2} of MgB_{2} are about 300 G and 18 T, respectively.[14] We used a field of 450 G. (Measurements at not too high fields compared to H_{c2} can minimize possible effects of dissipation due to flux motion and allow us to obtain reliable data for the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate \sigma.[15]) A set of measurements at different fields (up to 600 G) was also done to ensure that the values of \sigma obtained were independent of the applied field.

The low-field ac susceptibility is also a commonly used technique for measuring \lambda. It has been successfully applied to high-T_{c} materials[16] and is particularly suitable for powder samples. The accuracy in the temperature dependence of \lambda determined from the ac susceptibility technique is significantly higher than that of TF-\muSR.[15] In the superconducting state, the effective ac susceptibility \chi of a powder sample is related to \lambda by the equation[17, 18]

\[\chi(T)\!=\!\chi_{0}\!\left\langle 1-\frac{3\lambda}{R}{\rm coth}\frac{R}{ \lambda}+\frac{3\lambda^{2}}{R^{2}}\right\rangle,\] (3)

where \chi_{0} is the susceptibility in an ideal diamagnetic system, R is the radius of a grain, and \langle\cdots\rangle denotes a grain average defined by \langle x\rangle\!=\!fdRxR^{3}g(R)/\!fdRR^{3}g(R) with g(R) the grain-size distribution function. At low temperatures, \chi(T) can be expanded with \delta\lambda(T)\!=\!\lambda(T)\!-\!\lambda_{0}, where \lambda_{0}=\!\lambda(0\;\;{\rm K}). To the leading order in \delta\lambda, we find

\[\chi(T)\!\approx\!\chi(0)+\alpha\,\delta\lambda(T),\] (4)

where

\[\chi(0)\!=\!\chi_{0}\!\left\langle 1-\frac{3\lambda_{0}}{R}{\rm coth} \frac{R}{\lambda_{0}}+\frac{3\,\lambda_{0}^{2}}{R^{2}}\right\rangle,\] (5)

At low temperatures, the change in \lambda is proportional to the change in \chi. Thus from the temperature dependence of \chi(T) (exponential or power law), one can readily determine the temperature dependence of \lambda(T) in the low-temperature regime. However, to determine the absolute value of \lambda, we need to know accurately the grain distribution function g(R), which is beyond the scope of the present work.
