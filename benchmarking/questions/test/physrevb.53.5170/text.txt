###### Abstract

We report measurements of thermoelectric power (TEP) for high-pressure synthesized CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b superconductors. The magnitude of TEP for the sample with \(T_{c,\mathit{zero}}\)=115.9 K is very small and shows a sign crossover at \(\sim\)160 K. The TEP shows a peak behavior and displays an approximately linear temperature dependence with a negative slope \(-\)0.033 \(\mu\)V/K\({}^{2}\) for 120\(\approx\)_T_\(\Leftrightarrow\)240 K. These features resemble those for other known high-\(T_{c}\) cuprate superconductors, in particular \(S_{a}\) in the \(a\) direction for an untwinned YBa2Cu3O7-b single crystal and polycrystalline Tl-2201 samples. A brief discussion is given on the TEP behavior in comparison with CuBa2YCu2O7-b cuprate superconductors by considering their similar structure of building blocks and type of charge reservoir.

The cuprate superconductor CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b (Cu-1234) with transition temperature of 117 K has recently been synthesized using high-pressure synthesis techniques by several groups.[1, 2, 3, 4] The crystal structure of CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b is known to be in the category of (ACuO3-)_n_(BO1-_n_)\({}_{n}\) intergrowth structure.[5] So far, there are no data available on the thermopower of this high-pressure synthesized CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b superconductor. The thermopower behavior of CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b superconductor is thus of interest for identifying its similarities and differences as compared to other perovskite-based cuprate superconductors.

Among the normal-state transport properties, thermoelectric power (TEP) is known to be a sensitive probe to the energy dependence of the electron relaxation processes and topology of Fermi surface. A number of studies[6] have shown that the TEP for cuprate superconductors tends to show peak behavior and a more positive value with decreasing hole carrier concentration regardless the number of CuO2 planes per unit cell. Virtually all the Bi- and Tl-based cuprates in the normal state well above \(T_{c}\) display an approximately linear temperature dependence in TEP with a negative slope of \(-\)0.024 to \(-\)0.03 \(\mu\)V/K.[2, 6] In this paper, we present the first measurements of TEP on high-pressure synthesized CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b superconductors. Our general finding is that our nearly single-phase sample has the universal behavior characteristic of \(ab\) plane of optimally doped or overdoped high-\(T_{c}\) cuprates, particularly reminiscent of YBa2Cu3O7-b (Ref. [7]) and Tl2Ba2CuO6+b.[8].

Polycrystalline samples of CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b were synthesized following the procedure described in Ref. [1]. In brief, CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b was synthesized at 950 degC under 5 GPa for 1 h by using the starting materials of BaO2, CaO, and CuO with stoichiometric composition. Electrical resistivity was measured using the standard four-probe technique. Thermoelectric power was measured between 80 and 340 K by employing two pairs of copper-constantan thermocouples. Data were taken only after the system reached thermal equilibrium, which was monitored by a calibrated Si diode and the voltage response across Cu Seebeck probes. Temperature gradients were typically between 0.3 and 0.5 K. The uncertainty of measurements is \(\pm\) 0.1 \(\mu\)V/K.

As shown in Fig. 1, the powder x-ray diffraction pattern indicates that the sample is a nearly single phase of CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b. Most of the peaks can be indexed based on a tetragonal unit cell with the lattice constants of \(a\)= 3.859(2) A and \(c\)= 18.000(12) A. In common with other high-\(T_{c}\) cuprate superconductors, the sample displays a linear temperature dependence of resistivity, and shows a zero resistivity at 115.9 K (Fig. 2). The onset diamagnetic transition measured at a field of 10 Oe is found to be 117 K. In Fig. 3 we plot the thermoelectric power data against temperature, which has been corrected for the contribution of Cu leads. A trace amount of carbon content was detected in our sample by chemical analysis. The possibility of the existence of minor phase of (Cu1-c,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11-b  is not excluded.[1, 4, 9] We, however, believe this situation would not affect our TEP results. The main features of the TEP data for our CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-b (\(T_{c,\mathit{zero}}\)= 115.9 K) ceramic sample are (1) a crossover to negative sign at \(T\)\(\Rightarrow\)160 K, (2) a positive and sharp peak near \(T_{c}\), and (3) an approximately linear temperature dependence with a negative slope of \(-\)0.033 \(\mu\)V/K\({}^{2}\) in the temperature range 120-240 K. These features are typical of high-\(T_{c}\) cuprate superconductors with optimized or overdoped carrier concentration. The peak behavior is quite similar to the \(ab\)-plane TEP, \(S_{ab}\), for Bi- and Tl-based cuprates, and is generally considered to be intrinsic to the CuO2 planes. This view is also supported by our recent measurements on polycrystalline (Bi,Pb)-223 cuprates with \(2a\)\(\times\)\(2b\)\(\times\)\(c\) superstructure as a result of one-fourth of oxygen missing in the CuO2 planes.[10] We note that the TEP curve, specifically the sharp peak with a sign crossover at much lower temperature (i.e., 160 K) and an inflection point at \(\sim\)240 K marking a decrease of slope to \(-\)0.0137 \(\mu\)V/K\({}^{2}\) for 240\(\leq\)\(T\)\(\Leftrightarrow\)340 K, is similar to \(S_{a}\) in the \(a\) direction for an untwinned YBa2Cu3O7-b single crystal[7] (see inset of Fig. 3) and polycrystalline Tl-2201 samples,[8] suggesting some common transport mechanism to contribute the temperature dependence of TEP and opposite sign for these cuprates.

For the Bi-,[8] Tl-,[8] and Hg-based[11] superconductors, TEP often shows a positive shift in magnitude which is nearly temperature-independent as the hole carrier concentration decreases (e.g., by reducing the oxygen content). Nevertheless, TEP for \(\rm YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}\) appears to have a more complicated sensitivity to the oxygen stoichiometry than other cuprate superconductors. This complication has been ascribed to the CuO chains contribution by a simplified two-band model with a CuO\({}_{2}\)-plane-related, quasi-two-dimensional (2D) band and a CuO-chain-related, quasi-1D band.[7, 12] Therefore, the CuO chains contribution to both the electrical conductivity[13] and TEP appears to be unique among the high-\(T_{c}\) cuprate superconductors.

As we write down the chemical formula of Y-123 cuprate in the four number naming scheme as \(\rm CuBa_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7-\delta}\) (Cu-1212), one can readily find its structural similarity to \(\rm CuBa_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{11-\delta}\). The CuO chainlike coordination exists between the BaO bilayers in both \(\rm CuBa_{2}Ca_{3}\) Cu\({}_{4}O_{11-\delta}\) and \(\rm CuBa_{2}YCu_{2}O_{y-\delta}\) cuprates.[5] Due to their similar CuO chain configuration in the structure, which is also the charge reservoir for both compounds, it is worthwhile to compare our data with those of \(\rm CuBa_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7-\delta}\) in the literature in order to gain some insight. It should also be noted that the TEP of \(\rm La_{1.8}Sr_{0.2}CaCu_{2}O_{6-\delta}\) behaves similarly to that of \(\rm La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}\) because of their similar structures of building blocks and similar sources of charge reservoir.[14] Despite the controversy whether the \(\rm CO_{3}\) groups are partially substituting the CuO sites in \(\rm CuBa_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{11-\delta}\),[14, 5, 9] one could reasonably expect similar contributions of CuO chains to the electrical conductivity for \(\rm CuBa_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{11-\delta}\), if the oxygen content in the CuO chains is sufficient. One could further expect that TEP for \(\rm CuBa_{2}Ca_{3}Cu_{4}O_{11-\delta}\) would be dominated by the most conductive paths from both the \(\rm CuO_{2}\) planes and the CuO chains due to their comparable electrical conductivity, e.g., \(\sigma_{\rm chain}\)= 0.0084 (\(\mu\Omega\) cm)\({}^{-1}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm plane}\)= 0.0056 (\(\mu\Omega\) cm)\({}^{-1}\) in the case of \(\rm CuBa_{2}YCu_{2}O_{7-\delta}\) single crystal.[13] However, it appears that a small deviation of oxygen vacancy could result in different magnitude of TEP and even a sign change, particularly in \(S_{b}\) which has contributions from CuO chains.[7, 15, 16] This could be due to one-dimensional conduction nature of Cu-O chains which is extremely sensitive to the broken segments of chains as a result of oxygen defects. It has been demonstrated that more oxygen deficiency (larger probability of broken chains) reflects more positive TEP of CuO chains.[7] Therefore, more positive TEP of the

  sample would suggest more broken segments of CuO chain configuration. With this picture in mind, by comparing with untwinned single crystal data of CuBa2YCu2 O7-_d_, it could give us a hint on whether the CuO chains play a role in the TEP behavior.

Turning to our TEP data in Fig. 3, it seems to indicate that the conduction for this CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-_d_ sample (_Tc_,zero=115.9 K) is mainly from the carriers in the CuO2 planes. For polycrystalline samples, the random arrangement of grain orientations would have TEP contributions from all three crystallographic axes. It is quite natural to expect that the TEP data in Fig. 3 are mainly contributed from _ab_ planes like other cuprate superconductors due to their anisotropic nature. In fact, both the peak behavior above _Tc_ and the sign crossover are quite similar to the _ab_-plane TEP of other high-_Tc_ cuprate superconductors. One could argue that the crystal structure of CuBa2Ca2Cu4O11-_d_ may either involve the CuO chains or CuO2 planes charge reservoir between BaO bilayers. Nevertheless, one can readily see that it is unlikely to have CuO2 planes exist between BaO bilayers because that would give the valence state of Cu to be +5 if one takes +2.25 as the valence state of Cu for the rest of the CuO2 planes. The arrangements of Cu and O atoms between the BaO bilayers of CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-_d_ are most likely either in the form of CuO chains in one direction or defect chain segments in both \(a\) and \(b\) directions. However, the possibility of partial substitution of CuO sites by CO3 groups is not excluded.4,9 In any event, the role of CuO chains conduction seems to be downplayed by the broken chain segments and the CO3 group substitutions for this sample, particularly when we consider the high pressure synthesis which involves a process similar to quench from high temperature after a short period of one-hour sintering. This might be able to explain the similarity between our TEP data in Fig. 3 and \(S_{a}\) of the \(a\) direction for an untwinned CuBa2YCu2O7-_d_ single crystal in Ref. [7]. It could also support our argument that our TEP data in Fig. 3 is mainly contributed from the CuO2 planes.

With regard to the effects of carrier concentration on TEP, unfortunately, it is not available to us due to the metastability of this high-pressure phase of CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-_d_, which tends to decompose upon further heat treatment both in the oxygen and argon atmosphere. However, in another high-pressure synthesized CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-_d_ sample with _Tc_,zero=102 K (Fig. 4) and _Tc_,onset=117 K, TEP in the normal state remains positive at \(T\) <= 340 K (Fig. 5). The broad superconducting transition in both resistivity (_Tc_,onset=117 K) and TEP may indicate the oxygen inhomogeneity from one grain to another across the sample. As compared to the data of Fig. 3, the relatively large positive values of TEP imply a lower hole carrier concentration for this sample, assuming that it follows the same systematic trend of high-_Tc_ cuprate superconductors. Higher sample resistivities (Fig. 4) might also suggest a lower carrier concentration than that of the _Tc_,zero=115.9 K sample. There are two possibilities for the origin of a lower hole carrier concentration. Either the oxygen loss or CO3 substitution in the charge reservoir of CuO1-_d_ layers could reduce the hole carrier concentration of CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-_d_. Although our TEP curve is quite similar to those of pre-oxygen-annealed _Sb_ in Ref. [7] (inset of Fig. 5) and some other CuBa2YCu2O7-_d_ samples,17,18 it is unlikely that the positive values of TEP in Fig. 5 is due to the extra contributions from the CuO chains as in the case of _Sb_ CuBa2YCu2O7-_d_ in Ref. [7]. The reasoning is given as follows. One can readily notice some differences of TEP at high temperatures between them. Our sample displays a slightly broader peak behavior and a minimum TEP above _Tc_ is shifted to higher temperature at ~230 K. Furthermore, TEP at \(T\) >= 250 K in our data continues to increase with increasing temperature, whereas the _Sb_ of CuBa2YCu2O7-_d_ in Ref. [7] decreases at \(T\) >= 250 K. The derived chain contribution was found to be nearly saturated and independent of temperature at \(T\) >= 240-250 K as a result of narrow band conduction.7 The sum of weighted contribution from CuO2 plane and CuO1-_d_ contributions would therefore result in a less positive TEP with increasing temperature, for the TEP of CuO2 planes (\(S_{a}\)) becomes more negative with increasing temperature at \(T\) >= 250 K. In addition, TEP of CuBa2YCu2O7-_d_ with large oxygen deficiency often displays a positive broad hump. In the light of increasing sample TEP for temperatures above 250 K in Fig. 5, it is therefore unlikely that CuO chain

  conduction plays a significant role to be responsible for the TEP behavior in the \(T_{c,\,{\rm zero}}\)\(=\) 102 K sample. It is more plausible that positive TEP results of Fig. 5 are a combination of higher oxygen content grains with a negative (or less positive) TEP and less oxygen content grains (more broken CuO chain segments) with a positive TEP as a result of oxygen inhomogeneity within the sample. However, partial insertion of CO3 groups between BaO bilayers could also possibly result in positive TEP results. The effect of CO3 groups insertion on TEP is discussed in the following.

We now turn to the question of the effects on TEP if CO3 groups are inserted between the BaO bilayers and partially substitute the CuO chain sites. Since the CO3 group itself is not expected to contribute the electrical conduction, one could also expect no direct contribution from CO3 groups to TEP. However, CO3 groups could effect the carrier concentration of (Cu1-_x_C_x_)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11-_g_. If we take +4 and +2.25 as the valence state for C and Cu of the CuO 2 planes, respectively, for (Cu0.68C0.32)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11.06 with the formula determined by the time-of-flight neutron-powder-diffraction data,[9] the valence state of Cu in the CuO chains would be +2.71, as compared to +3.12 for CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11.06 without containing CO3 groups. One can readily see that the CO3 groups act as electron donors instead of hole donors. The CO2\({}_{3}^{2-}\) anion seems to introduce holes because of its anionic nature; however, it should be noted that two oxygen atoms of the CO3 group are shared by the rocksalt layers of BaO. The net effect of inserted CO3 groups is merely CO2+ unit which would reduce the hole carrier concentration in the system. While the partial substitution of CO3 groups would most likely change the occupancy number of oxygen in the CuO chains, it is more plausible that the oxygen stoichiometry of CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-_g_ is not greater than 11, because the valence state of Cu would be +3 for d = 0 if we again take +2.25 as the valence state of Cu in the CuO 2 planes. It is now quite clear that the effect of CO3 insertion would reduce the hole carrier concentration. Although we are not clear how the reduced hole carrier concentration would be distributed in the CuO chains and CuO2 planes, TEP should become more positive as a result of CO3 insertion either by taking hole concentration away from the CuO chains or CuO2 planes assuming the oxygen stoichiometry remains the same.

In conclusion, we have measured thermoelectric power for high-pressure synthesized CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-_d_ cuprates. The nearly single phase sample with \(T_{c,\,{\rm zero}}\)\(=\) 115.9 K is found to show common TEP characteristics with other high-_T__c_ cuprates. By comparing with an untwinned single crystal of CuBa2YCu2O7-_d_, it is conceivable that the carrier conduction in the CuO 2 planes is responsible for the TEP behavior of \(T_{c,\,{\rm zero}}\)\(=\) 115.9 K sample without significant CuO chain contributions. Similarities can be found in both the structure and TEP behavior between the CuBa2Ca3Cu4O11-_d_ and CuBa2YCu2O7-_d_ cuprates. We suggest that the TEF behavior of high-_T__c_ cuprate superconductors is closely associated with the type of charge reservoir which has effects on the carrier characteristics.
