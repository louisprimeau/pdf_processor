Since the discovery of the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in rare-earth ternary compounds _R_Mo\({}_{6}\)_X_8 (_X_ = S, Se) (Ref. 1) and _R_Rh\({}_{4}\)**B\({}_{4}\)**2 much debate has ensued on the role that magnetism plays in suppressing superconductivity. Traditionally, the magnetic impurities are thought to break up the Cooper pairs because the exchange interaction between the spins of the impurity ions affects the two electrons which form the Cooper pair differently. More recently, research on the heavy-fermion and high-_T_c superconductors has shown that antiferromagnetism is not only prevalent in these superconducting systems by may serve to mediate the superconductivity, forcing us to readdress our understanding of the effect of magnetic order on superconductivity.

The recently discovered intermetallic borocarbide superconductors have moderately high _T_c's, up to 23 K,3,4 and long-range antiferromagnetic order,5 providing a novel system to pursue the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. Neutron-scattering results on the reentrant superconductor HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C reveal that incommensurate oscillatory spin fluctuations start to be observed just above the first superconducting transition _T_c ~ 8 K. As these oscillations grow in intensity, the system loses its superconductivity until the commensurate long-range antiferromagnetic order locks into place at _T_N ~ 5 K below which the oscillations decrease and the system reenters the superconducting state. The low-temperature magnetic structure for the Ho moments consists of ferromagnetic sheets of spins in the _a-b_ plane, with the sheets being antiferromagnetically aligned along the \(c\) axis.6 In this paper, we investigate this system through heat-capacity and hydrostatic pressure measurements. We find that the conduction electrons involved in the superconductivity are primarily Ni 3\(d\), while the antiferromagnetic ground state is composed of a Ho\({}^{3+}\) doublet. Our pressure results reveal that the long-range-ordering temperature _T_N increases faster than the superconducting temperature _T_c with pressure, consistent with expectations on how changes in the crystallographic structure affect the rare-earth moment interaction and the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi surface.

Polycrystalline HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C was prepared by arc melting and annealing as described elsewhere.7 Both _T_N and _T_c are strongly dependent on sample preparation,8 samples prepared by the same process as ours were characterized by neutron-scattering6 and resistive H\({}_{\text{c2}}\) measurements.5 A standard dc pulse-relaxation technique was used to measure the specific heat of the 65-mg sample at 0 and 2 T where the magnetoresistance of the Cermac thermometer and the sample heater are both less than 0.3%. A carbon-chip resistor monitored the sample temperature and was calibrated against the Cermac thermometer during every run. Magnetic susceptibility and resistivity up to 7 kbar were measured simultaneously on a sample of typical dimensions 2mm x 1mm x 0.5 mm in a BeCu piston clamp pressure cell. An ac coil technique, with a typical measuring field of 1 G and frequency of 400 Hz, and a lockin amplifier were employed to measure the ac magnetic susceptibility. The secondary coil was wound inside the Teflon bucket such that the background was flat and featureless below 20 K and could be easily subtracted. The electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four-probe dc technique and silver paint contacts. (V\({}_{0.99}\)Ti\({}_{0.01}\))\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) served as the manometer; at ambient pressure, it has a first-order metal-insulator transition at 141 K which decreases at a rate of 5.8 K/kbar.

  tion, which presumably arises from a hysteresis in the internal magnetic field from the Ho (Fig. 5).[6] The neutron measurements further show that by 2 T the antiferromagnetic peak is almost completely suppressed. This result implies that initial rise in the heat capacity around 7 K, and the rounded peak near 6 K at 2 T (Fig. 2), are due to magnetic contributions from the oscillatory spin fluctuations and a corresponding Schottky anomaly expected from crystal-field effects of the degenerate Ho\({}^{3+}\) multiplet.[9] The lack of any superconducting or antiferromagnetic anomalies in the heat capacity at 2 T indicates that moderate magnetic field leads to suppression of both the antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity.

In the inset to Fig. 1, we have enlarged the area around \(T_{c}\) to show the superconducting transition anomaly at 8.4 K. The critical field for the Ho compound is 0.5 T so that by 2 T no superconducting transition is observed. The superconducting specific-heat jump \(\Delta C/T_{c}\) is on the order of 10 (2) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\). Using the values of \(1.43 < \Delta C/\gamma T_{c} < 2.0\) found for the borocarbide superconductors,[10, 12] we estimate a \(\gamma\) of 6 (2) mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\), similar to the Ni metal \(\gamma\) of 7 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\).[13] This result is also on the same order as the \(\gamma\) of 7.5 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\) found for LaPt\({}_{1.7}\)Au\({}_{0.3}\)B\({}_{2}\)C with a \(T_{c}\) of 10.2 K.[10] The DOS at the Fermi surface in the HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C is considerably less enhanced than in LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (\(\gamma\) - 19 mJ/mol K\({}^{2}\)), implying that the decrease in \(T_{c}\) from 16.4 to 8.4 K may be due to a decrease in the DOS. The BCS critical temperature relation \(T_{c} \sim 0.85\Theta_{D}\exp[ - 1/N(0)V]\) suggests a smaller decrease in the DOS at the Fermi surface than we observe.[14]

The graph in Fig. 2 shows \(C/T\) versus \(T^{2}\) for HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C at 0 and 2 T (solid and open circles, respectively) and for superconducting LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C driven normal with magnetic field (dashed line) (Ref. [10]) and nonmagnetic CeNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C (solid line) for comparison.[11] The magnetism dominates the heat capacity such that the phonon and electron contribution to the specific heat are small in comparison. The Debye temperature \(\Theta_{D}\) of 348 K is estimated from the LuNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C data with the appropriate scaling of the molar masses. After subtraction of this lattice term, a large heat capacity remains which is associated with the magnetism from the Ho\({}^{3+}\) spins. In the inset to Fig. 2, the plot of \(\ln(C - C_{\rm phon})\) versus \(1/T\) shows the range of exponential behavior in the long-range-ordered state (solid line). The entropy associated with the transition of 5.5 (0.3) J/mol K is on the order of \(R\) ln2, indicating that the ground state is a doublet. Above \(T_{N}\), the entropy is mostly due to the magnetism from the remaining Ho\({}^{3+}\) spins. Only 50% of the magnetic entropy (\(R\) ln17) expected for the full Ho\({}^{3+}\) multiplet is recovered by 30 K in the specific-heat measurement, suggesting that the crystal-field energy levels consist of high-temperature (\(>\) 60 K) excited-state multiplets. In the 2-T data, the entropy associated with the Ho\({}^{3+}\) doublet ground state has shifted to higher temperatures with the suppression of \(T_{N}\), and it is not fully recovered within the measurement range of 30 K. The broad peak around 12 K observed in the inset to Fig. 2, also seen in susceptibility measurements, is sample dependent and appears to be due to a small percentage of a minority phase.

In summary, the heat-capacity measurements show that bulk superconductivity and local long-range magnetic order coexist in HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C. Band-structure calculations, combined with the heat-capacity results, suggest that the electronic density of states derived from the superconducting transition is mainly comprised of the Ni \(3d\) states.[15] The antiferromagnetic ground state involves

The inset shows the anomaly in the specific heat, \(\Delta C/T_{c}\), at the superconducting transition, \(T_{c}\).

  a Ho\({}^{3+}\) doublet. With increasing magnetic field, the system favors the incommensurate oscillatory magnetism with the suppression of both the superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order. Through the course of this work, we became aware of specific-heat data by Michor _et al._ on (Y\({}_{1-x}\)Er\({}_{x}\))Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C who observe similar results for ErNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C\({}^{16}\).

To elucidate the effect that magnetism has on the superconductivity, we measured resistivity and magnetic susceptibility as a function of hydrostatic pressure. Resistivity measurements on a series of rare-earth borocarbides by Eisaki _et al_. show that \(T_{c}\) increases as the rare-earth size decreases.[5] This effect may be accounted for in terms of the de Gennes factor which suggests that the magnetic pair breaking dominates the change in \(T_{c}\). Alternatively, recent work by Mattheiss _et al_. indicates that \(T_{c}\) is determined by the _s-p_ states involved in the B-Ni-B angled bond.[15] Hydrostatic pressure should affect the B-Ni-B bond and the de Gennes factor differently and allow us to address these two different influences on \(T_{c}\).

In Fig. 3, the resistivity is graphed as a function of temperature. At ambient pressure, the reentrant behavior is not observed in the resistivity, implying that the Cooper pairs remain coherent even in the presence of the long-range order and the oscillatory spin fluctuations (Fig. 4). Other groups have observed reentrant resistivity behavior at ambient pressure and magnetic field;[5, 8] however, this is typically on lower \(T_{c}\) samples where impurities might be expected to help break up the superconducting state. By 4.5 kbar, \(T_{N}\) has increased 1 K, and the reentrant behavior is observed in both the magnetic susceptibility and the resistivity at the same temperature. The superconducting transition temperature, \(T_{c}\), increases on the order of 0.07 (0.04) K/kbar with increasing pressure, \(P\), qualitatively consistent with the result that decreasing the rare-earth size leads to a higher \(T_{c}\). This pressure dependence is stronger than that observed in \(RRh_{4}B_{4}\) superconductors which is in agreement with the observation that \(T_{c}\) changes with rare-earth radius twice as fast in \(R\)Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C than in \(RRh_{4}B_{4}\).[17] Other groups have observed a small decrease in \(T_{c}\) with increasing pressure. These differences may be related to differences in sample preparation and in the anisotropic nature of the material, and we do not discount the possibility for negative \(dT_{c}/dP\) being observed in all samples under sufficiently high pressure.[18]

In Fig. 4, the magnetic susceptibility reveals that the long-range-ordering temperature, \(T_{N}\), increases faster [\(dT_{N}/dP\sim\) 0.25 (0.04) K/kbar] than the superconducting transition, \(T_{c}\), with pressure. A smaller percentage of the sample is initially superconducting below \(T_{c}\) as the pressure in increased, and by 7 kbar the resistivity no longer drops to zero with the onset of the superconducting behavior. Because \(T_{N}\) and the reentrant superconducting temperature coincide, the magnetic long-range order is not expected to be detrimental to the superconductivity; therefore, we propose that the temperature for the formation of the oscillatory spin is also increasing with pressure and that it is this magnetism which breaks up the formation of the Cooper pairs resulting in finite resistance below \(T_{c}\). This interpretation agrees with the neutron-scattering data which suggest that it is the oscillatory state itself, not the local antiferromagnetic order, which is detrimental to the superconductivity.[6]

The effects of pressure can be qualitatively understood by considering the crystal structure consisting of HoC NaCl-type layers and Ni\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\) layers. Previous results have shown that the \(a\) axis increases and the \(c\) axis weakly decreases as larger rare-earth ions are substituted into the lattice.[19] The superconductivity is stabilized by the shrinkage of the \(a\) axis due to a reduced distortion of the B-Ni-B tetrahedron.[14] In contrast, \(T_{N}\) depends on the antiferromagnetic coupling between the rare-earth spins which is mediated via the RKKY interaction[6] and increases upon shrinkage of the \(c\) axis.[5] The \(a\) axis, which is determined mostly from strong metallic bonding be

Figure 3: Pressure-dependent resistivity, \(\rho\), of HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C shows that \(T_{c}\) weakly increases with pressure, \(P\). The peak in \(\rho\) at higher pressures marks the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, \(T_{N}\).

  tween the Ni's, is weakly compressible, and the \(c\) axis, formed indirectly via the short boron-carbon bonds, should be more compressible. As observed, pressure should strongly increase \(T_{N}\) by shrinking the \(c\) axis and increasing the RKKY interaction between the Ho-Ho spins, and it could also increase \(T_{c}\) by weakly shrinking the _a_-axis leading to less distortion of the Bi-Ni-B angled bond and a larger DOS at the Fermi surface. Such an interpretation would need to be supported by measurements of the bulk modulus and changes in the DOS with pressure. Nonetheless, the increase in the long-range-ordering temperature, \(T_{N}\), does not initially decrease \(T_{c}\), which argues against the coupling between rare-earth moments being the main contribution in determining \(T_{c}\). An alternate explanation for the determination of \(T_{c}\) depends on the oscillatory spins breaking up the superconducting Cooper pairs. Although our data supports that the oscillatory spins are responsible for the finite resistivitly below \(T_{c}\), we do not know how this model would account for the changes in \(T_{c}\) with pressure.

In Fig. 5, we summarize our heat-capacity data and pressure results along with resistive \(H_{c2}\) data by Eisaki _et al._[5] and magnetic order-parameter data from neutron measurements by Grigereit _et al._[6] Together, the results show that long-range local moment magnetism and bulk superconductivity coexist in HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, with the Ho\({}^{3+}\) 4\(f\) rare-earth magnetic moments and the superconducting Ni\({}^{3+}\) 3\(d\) conduction electrons weakly coupled. This situation of superconductivity coexisting with long-range order, but detrimentally affected by oscillatory spin fluctuations, has been encountered in the magnetic superconductors \(R\)Rh\({}_{4}\)B\({}_{4}\), the details of which have been worked out previously.[2, 9] While magnetic field is detrimental to \(T_{c}\) and \(T_{N}\), pressure enhances both \(T_{c}\) and \(T_{N}\) for pressure less than 7 kbar. These results indicate that, in addition to the rare-earth magnetism, the crystallographic structure has an important influence on the superconducting and magnetic properties of the rare-earth borocarbides.

We are pleased to acknowledge valuable discussions with H. Eisaki and T. Grigereit. After completion of this work, we became aware of neutron-scattering results by Goldman _et al._ and co-workers on single-crystal HoNi\({}_{2}\)B\({}_{2}\)C, which give additional insight into the coupling between the superconductivity and rare-earth magnetism.[20]
